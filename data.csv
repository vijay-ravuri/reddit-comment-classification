AskReddit,"Redditors who have actually won a “lifetime” supply of something, what was the supply you won and how long did it actually last?","I won free full body massages for life, which basically just translates to 2 massages a week. It was really good. I got addicted. I knew everyone who worked there and I got to experiment with all of them to see which were the best. Ended up fluctuating between 3 different staff towards the end. They would even train new staff on me for free because I spent so much time over there. Those training massages never cost me anything either or counted towards my 2 free massage a week limit.

When the place closed down I realized just how expensive massages were... I haven't had one in ages and I miss it so bad."

AskReddit,What is the most fucked up thing that happened in reddit ?,"relationship advice post by a husband started by saying that his wife isnt the smartest cookie in the jar. The couple was struggling financially living month to month, but they get by. Had kids too.

Wife suddenly gets the genius idea that they could make a bunch of cash if their car crashed and got written off. Happened to one of her friends who won an insurance claim after driving into a ditch and was encouraging others to do so. Husband says no every time wife talks about it, explains reasons why and finally makes her promise not to talk about it at all.

Next week, the guy gets a call from the police saying the wife had run into an accident and is in police custody. Turns out the wife had been waiting at a traffic stop, then suddenly accelerated forward during a red light and drove head first into a vehicle coming from the other side at top speed. She wasn't injured, but the other vehicle had a mother and a kid who instantly died and another teenage kid in critical condition. Guy visits wife in custody and she acts all proud with no remorse as if she did something great for her family.

Dude made the post asking whether he should come clean about her talking to him earlier about the accident and insurance fraud, which will likely change her manslaughter charge to murder and add decades to her sentence. The post stayed up for less than an hour."
AskReddit,What dark secret are you hiding from everyone?,"When my grandpa was on his death bed, he admitted to killing fellow marines in the Vietnam war for torturing and raping young girls. Most of our family doesn’t know.

He was a gunsmith his whole life and was very proud of being a marine, but the guilt he carried from the war made him believe he was being punished in the end. He died a really painful and traumatic death that I would never wish on anybody. I hope it lets him rest easier in peace that the majority of you commend what he did, I certainly never held any qualms about it."

Edit: wow I did not expect so much liked and reactions. Great to see so many people agree with me and are enjoying this game. 

To answer some of the most asked questions/comments:
- how do you watch the tournament? I think starting tomorrow you search of form the Redbull Twitch channel. Probably you can find it just searching aoe2 on Twitch.
- can you still buy this game? Yes, it's on Steam. Be sure to get aoe2 DE, that's the definitive edition. It still gets regular updates and has a very active player base. Also there are tons of single player campaigns. 
- you are just a shill for Redbull. Nope, I don't drink Redbull and find it disgusting. But it is still cool that they are sponsoring it, that's why I mentioned them. 
- [insert game] is also old but better. I really enjoy other older games as well. It doesn't have to be just 1 game.  But for me aoe 2 is the one that I just keep going back to and keep playing.

AskReddit,Who had the biggest fall from grace in history?,"Philippe Petain was a national hero of France after World War 1. He won the 9 month Battle of Verdun as a general and inspired hope and optimism at a time when it seemed like the war would never end.

Fast forward to World War II and he became the head of state of Vichy France and was a puppet for the Nazis. He ran Vichy state in a semi-fascist manner and constantly sought to appease the Nazis to preserve Vichy's limited freedoms, including signing antisemitic ordinances and allowing deportation to concentration camps. 

At the end of the war, he was convicted of treason on all counts and originally sentenced to death before being reduced to life imprisonment by Charles de Gaulle on account of Petain's advanced age and service during World War 1.

De Gaulle would later summarize Petain's life as ""successively banal, then glorious, then deplorable, but never mediocre"" and also ""The Marshall is a great man who died in 1925. The trouble is, he didn't know it."""

A few years ago I had a client bring his young cat in complaining of lethargy. Besides being a bit underweight, the physical exam was unremarkable so I asked more questions about the cat's diet:


Me: What do you feed the cat? 

Owner: [online trendy raw food brand]

Me: How is his appetite? Does he finish what you feed him? 

Owner: Yes, he always eats everything.

Me: How much do you feed him?

Owner: 1/2 cup.

Me: Once or twice daily?

Owner: Once every 3 or 4 days.

Me: ........ You only feed your cat twice a week?

Owner: I believe in a more natural feeding approach, and based on my research that's how often cats eat in the wild. 


This owner was slowly starving his cat to death based on some cockamamie idea he'd made up watching National Geographic. I had to explain to him that domestic cats are not tigers, and that small wildcats eat 10-20 small meals daily. Surprise surprise the cat's lethargy and weight improved with regular feeding."

I came upstairs and found her with the carbon monoxide detector in pieces on the coffee table. She said it was beeping, and apparently once years ago in our last house one was malfunctioning and giving a false alarm so I guess she just assumed it was happening again. I shrugged it off and continued getting ready. I was about to leave but something was nagging at me, she was insisting it was fine. After some arguing with her I said “No. we are calling the fire department.” So I did. They came, and the levels of carbon monoxide were so high in the basement they said anyone sleeping down there would be dead already. Our cats were vomiting from the poisoning and we didn’t realize. I guess the filter on the furnace was so clogged it was pumping out carbon monoxide. One of the fire fighters pulled me aside and said if I hadn’t called I likely would have come home to my mom dead in her bed."

AskReddit,"Parents who tried their best to raise their kids to be good humans but they turned out to be jerks, what do you wish you did differently?","You don't have to win every power struggle.

I don't have jerk kids. But I do think I've learned a lot from having 4 very different kids, and I think too many parents 1. Think the same strategies work for all kids (ie, rule-consequence-behavior falls in line, rinse and repeat) and 2. Focus on the behavior rather than the cause.

If you have a kid who doesn't respond to your parenting style/philosophy, you should rethink your approach. It's not all the kid's fault.

Some kids will burn their lives to the ground to make a point. I have one like that. For too long, it was a vicious cycle of

* kid acts out
* I punish
* kid is angry, acts out more
* I punish harder
* kid is angrier, acts out even more
* I punish even harder

and on and on and on and on. Something needs to break the cycle.

For instance, if your kid is challenging your authority, it's usually a bid for more independence. They're trying to be more mature, and they want your adult respect. You don't have to excuse the bad behavior; consequences are OK. But you ALSO have to look for ways to help your kid get that need met.

You don't have to tie it to the actual incident, so it doesn't look like a reward. Give them more responsibility for themselves.

* Let him walk to school alone if he doesn't get to do that.
* Quit bugging him so much about what he does with his free time, even if you think he should be ""getting more fresh air.""
* Look for any opportunity to let him choose something. ""We're going to do something as a family on Sunday. You can choose what we do."" or where we eat or whatever.
* Don't tell him WHEN he has to do his chores. Let him set his Saturday schedule: ""I need you to mow the lawn and do the dishes today. You can do it any time between now and 6 p.m.""

If you address the cause of the behavior, it's going to do way more to correct a bad behavior, and you'll also get more respect from your kid.

If you insist on winning every power struggle, your kid is going to see everything as a fight.

EDIT: I need to give my wife credit for helping me understand this over the years. She's not only a great mom and wife, she's also a really good therapist. She's gained a lot of perspective working with other kids and parents and working on those relationships."

Edit: I have cone dystrophy. It started as little falling stars in the peripheral vision of one eye and has progressed to completely blurred out central vision in that eye.

If you experience any strange symptoms with your eyes, see an optometrist right away! Too many of you are saying you have things going on that haven’t been checked! I’m lucky to live in Canada, so I drove straight to the optometrist the day my symptoms started and was immediately sent to a retinal specialist and had testing done.

He goes to the police on that, he’s fingerprinted, mug shot taken and processed. He’ll then be arraigned and release on his own recognizance. All this will be worked out beforehand by his lawyers and the DA. He might fight extradition in Florida and possibly win with the right judge.

I saw her go through it and continued to fill gas as she read my text messages… I’m a fairly open person with little to hide but I do value trust and honestly. Soon as the pump clicked she put it back in a hurry. I skipped the dinner plans and dropped her home.

If I can’t even trust you with my phone, I can’t trust you with my future.

&#x200B;

Edit: **What happened next:**

I didn't address it immediately. She didn't know i was driving towards her house until we got super close at which point we had maybe 2 minutes left together.

In a calm and 'im disappointed in you' tone I told her I caught her in the act and this blatant breach of privacy was a deal breaker for me. She's too old to be acting like an insecure teenager (she was 26) and that she should address this behaviour before pursuing serious relationships. 

She knew she was in the wrong. She stayed quiet till we got back and left the car without a word.

Still no apology though.


Edit2: 
I DO have a phone password. But my car is a trusted bluetooth spot so it stays unlocked when connected to car for music."

AskReddit,What are things racist people do that they don’t think is racist?,"This is a long one:

I had a coworker when I was a manager in a major retailer.  We were running a project that required 3rd party hiring.  Well, in this team was a group of 7 POC who rode together for work.  Whenever I was around, they were hard working, and quick to listen.  But whenever I was at a different location or off for a few days, I would come back and this manager would brief me on how things went, and every time she would bring up how terrible and rude and lazy this group was, and when I would go out to the floor, they would greet me with things like ""thank God you're back, we were about to quit"".   It went on like this until one day I was coming back, halfway through shift (drive time) and the group was leaving, clearly pissed off.  Said they couldn't stand her racist ass any more.  Apparently she accused them of ""being disrespectful and probably stealing like you people do"".  They ended up filing a case and reporting her.  I was told I was gonna have to provide testimony (as the only other manager present).  Right before I got on the call, she actually said ""you know I'm not racist.  I have even dated a darkie"".    I was floored.   I held nothing back in the testimony."

My attempts to fire back were stopped by her husband and my ex-wife.  I was expected to take it but not give it.

She went to the restroom and as she got off.her chair, the leg broke and she face planted.

AskReddit,When did you realize you married the wrong person?,"We were in the bathroom getting showered and dressed for a friend’s wedding. I was in the best shape of my life at the time, feeling good about myself, and I thought I looked good in that suit.

She was finishing her makeup and I remarked at how beautiful she looked. I waited for her to say something nice in reply but she didn’t. And it just hit me. I couldn’t remember a single time that she complimented me on my appearance.

So I said that to her. I said “You know, I always tell you how beautiful you are, and how attracted to you I am, but I never recall you ever saying that I look good or that I look handsome.” She stopped applying her mascara long enough to dismissively roll her eyes at me.

So I made the mistake of asking her, “Do you even find me attractive?”

And she flatly said “No.”

I asked, “Why did you marry me then?”

And she said “I didn’t think it was important at the time.”

I never felt so ugly and unloved. And it hurt even more when I had been feeling so good about myself for once in my life 30 seconds earlier.

AskReddit,[serious] What is the fastest way you have seen someone ruin their life?,"15-20 years ago, an ex worked at a dream job type of place. If you make it professionally in that field, this employer was/is the absolute peak, there is no better place to go. 

New guy started there, on ex’s team, right out of university. His first day he went to the company store and got ALL the gear with company’s name on it- tshirt, hat, socks, etc- and proudly put it all on. 

After work, team took the new guy out to drinks to celebrate his first day at dream job employer. New guy gets way too drunk, goes outside to smoke a cig, and then takes his penis out and presses it up against the bar’s glass window. Penis man’s new colleagues, all the bar’s patrons, and all their staff see his dick. Ex closed out their tab and got drunk guy home- 

the bar calls the employer the next morning, complaining about the new guy’s dick antics, banning him and anyone wearing company gear.  New Guy, was fired before lunch, on day 2. A cautionary story

EDIT: The bar was in a never gentrified, always wealthy part of SF, CA. Patrons were very wealthy people, entitled. Myself, Having worked in fine dining in college, I can only imagine the absolute HELL those patrons raised about seeing some dipshit’s dick while slurping down their 3rd martini. 
Many of you relate to this story, and have shared about not even wearing something as small as a lanyard w/ company info on it. This is all great logic, please keep it up and share that advice. It is especially pertinent, when your employer, like the subject of my story, is known globally for children’s entertainment. Exposing yourself to anyone, let alone a bunch of connected, rich assholes, is definitely not the move when Pixar signs your check."

AskReddit,What job is useless?,"I took a job scheduling residential HVAC technicians for a mid-sized company after a few years of working in the field. A few months in, the company ended its residential program to focus on commercial.

Thing is, they already had commercial schedulers. My boss told me she'd find me a new roll, but then she took another job elsewhere and left.

I stayed as a scheduler with no one to schedule in a department that no longer existed. No one in the office seemed to realize this, and for over half a decade, I would show up, make friendly conversation in the breakroom while making my coffee, and then literally just did nothing the rest of the day. Having left a stressful job, it was glorious.

Occasionally someone would ask me an hvac or system-related question over email, and that was it. I made sure everyone liked me by bringing in bagels every Monday and donuts every Friday. 

Then covid happened and now I was doing nothing at home! 

When I learned the company was being sold, I figured I wouldn't tempt fate anymore and applied elsewhere. My department head gave a glowing recommendation, having no idea what I even did but knowing I was friendly and helped him jump his car a few times.

TLDR: The department I was adminning was downsized, but they forgot about me and I essentially took a six year paid vacation.

EDIT: Wow, this blew up. To everyone asking what I did all day, I wound up using the time to earn an engineering degree."
AskReddit,Who are some people who died telling us the truth?,"Ignaz Semmelweis. The first doctor to implement hand washing in hospitals. It’s saved millions of lives and is the single greatest innovation in medicine.

For his radical theory, that doctors were killing patients by not washing their hands, he was shunned from the medical profession by his peers. The rejection and failure to adopt hand washing drove him mad. His rival took his job and had him sent to the asylum. He died 4 days after being committed, from injuries he sustained from being beaten in the ward.

Years after his death, his theories about hand washing were proven correct. Today he’s known as “the savior of mothers” because he first proved hand washing saved lives by implementing it in the birthing ward, where 1 in 4 women died at the hospital during birth. This was because doctors would handle cadavers and then immediately attend to birthing mothers, infecting them. After hand washing was implemented, the rate of death for birthing mothers dropped to less than 5%."

AskReddit,How did somebody you know ruin their life in one day?,"My dad used a dirty needle while doing drugs and got HIV. In 2008 he told us he was living with aids because of that one day. We have helped pay for the meds or his bills(because he paid for his meds and didn’t have the money) ever since. Last summer he got Covid and when the doc was talking to my sister on the phone she asked what special treatment he would need to have due to having aids. His doctor of 20 years said, “what? He doesn’t have aids”. We haven’t talked to him since.

Edit for clarification:
- At the time, He said he had been living with HIV for years and that it developed into AIDS for not treating it.
- I was 16 and dumb. No I didn’t sit down and interrogate my father for hours to make sure he wasn’t lying. How dare I not know right?
- he gave permission to the doctor to speak to my sister about his medical treatment. No laws broken. 
- the doctor clarified. It wasn’t a 2 min conversation. He had been seeing my dad as a patient for 20 years and knew his medical history. He was as upset us we were that he lied. 
- after finding out, me and my sister confronted him and he admitted to it all. HE NEVER HAD HIV OR AIDS. IT WAS ALL A LIE."

AskReddit,What could be done to prevent mass shootings?,"A lot of these mass shooters aren't just coming out of nowhere,, according to this [study](https://efsgv.org/press/study-two-thirds-of-mass-shootings-linked-to-domestic-violence/) a solid majority of mass shooting were part of domestic violence or the shooters had a history of domestic violence. Not going to spend all night digging into this, but I wouldn't be surprised if mass shooters are llikely to have history of other violent or otherwise antisocial(Stalking for example) crimes and behaviors.

Mass shooting isn't generally the start, it's an escalation, and I think it's a pretty good indication that we really need to handle domestic violence and other such crimes a lot better, if not for how fucked up it already is, then to stop it from escalating into something worse."
AskReddit,"what has been your most bone-chilling, hair-raising, ""Let's get the hell out of here"" experience?","I’m a criminal defense investigator. I had a murder case involving two brothers. The one accused of the murders was very autistic, and his brother was a schizophrenic. The schizophrenic brother lived in a potato shack in the middle of the desert. I needed to talk to him several times throughout the course of the investigation, and since he didn’t have a phone or electricity, I had to drive several hours out to his house and yell his name from the fence line until he came out of the shack.

This investigation lasted for several years, and over time I developed a rapport with schizophrenic brother, and I kind of got to like him. He would talk your ear off about the aliens with golden eyes and the underground tunnels that connect all the Walmarts in the country, but he was pretty entertaining, and part of me wonders how much of it was a “show”.

Schizophrenic brother eventually gets a girlfriend; she’s a tweaker who has mistaken his schizophrenia for meth induced psychosis. I talked to her a few times in jail when she was sober, and she was surprisingly charming and insightful.

The last time I go to see schizophrenic brother, it’s a dark winter night and tweaker girlfriend is there; she’s lurking in the shadows and staring daggers at me the entire time I’m talking to him. I cut off his conversation about the speakers in his fillings and walk back to my truck to leave. 

A minute later, schizophrenic brother comes running out and tells me that he wants to show me something in his shack. He’s never invited me inside before, and I’m not thrilled by the prospect. The whole thing feels off to me, so I tell him I have to get going, and start the truck. 

The look of relief on his face when I declined to go inside convinced me that tweaker girlfriend was waiting behind the door with a hammer or something. A few months later I learned that she shot him in his sleep and stashed his body in an old refrigerator. She has since plead guilty to his murder.

Edit: rapport, not report."

AskReddit,What’s the most fucked up thing you’ve seen at work?,"I once provided care for a man with dementia that often led to him being paranoid.

His brother (an ex police officer) was stealing from him. He would pick up his pension but steal about 10-20% of it each time.

When the gentleman I cared for called his brother out on it, his brother would always blame his dementia for his suspicions, and then guilt trip him into apologising for doubting him.

Eventually we were asked to collect his pension instead of his brother, after his brother refused to provide a full paper trail of his pension and to deliver the money in the sealed envelope it's given in at the office.

His brother kicked off big time, trying to get us to stop providing care so he could keep exploiting him.

We stood our ground, duty of care above all else, and our man got the pension he earned through his life in full.

I saw lots of other messed up stuff in that job, but there's something about a man's older brother exploiting and emotionally gaslighting him which just hits hard."

Switzerland is very safe and I feel safe there too. I moved to Austria where guns aren't as prevalent (but still exist). I don't feel a difference.

The man had the country build him an airstrip in the middle of the jungle near a palatial estate known as the Versailles of the Jungle, so that he can charter a Concorde to take him to go shopping in Paris.

There were uncountable human right violations and massacres attributed to him during his rule.

His support for the Hutu Extremists after the Rwandan Genocide directly led to the First and Second Congo Wars which attributed to the deaths of some 6 Million people.

I sat at the table for a good 15min just browsing my phone with no food or drink on the table until I decided to call a waiter over. They told me when I'm ready, I can pay at the front counter.

Went to Brazil to visit my wife's family and we ordered some street food. I tried to pay upon order and my wife told me they take payment after we finish eating even if it's street food... After eating, we totally forgot that we haven't paid yet and just got up and walked away because we're so used to paying upon order. About 50metres of walking, I was like, wait... We didn't pay for the food. We rushed back to pay and the cooks had a good laugh about it."

AskReddit,How did the kid from your school die?,"Of all things, an unfortunate camping accident.

This was before cellphones. Two friends went out for the weekend to a campground for some fishing over the weekend. When they didn't arrive home at the time they said they would, the parents called the provincial park to see if they were running a bit late - the weather wasn't great and the camp was about an hour away from town so it was entirely possible they decided to stay another night and drive out in the morning instead.

The park warden stumbled upon their campsite and found both of them dead in their shared tent. Turns out it was a cool night and they decided to run a small heater in the tent to be warm... but it was an old heater that didn't have a shut-off sensor built in. The heater ran all night while they were asleep and since they didn't open the flaps on their tent for air circulation (because they wanted to trap the heat), the tent filled with carbon monoxide and suffocated them in their sleep.

So sad... and a week before school too.

AskReddit,"[NSFW] People who have found a dead body, what's the story?","I was 21. I woke up around 9:30 or 10. I peeked in my moms room to say good morning, her tv was on but she wasn’t there. She liked to use the bathroom in the master bedroom if it was available, more privacy I guess, and the door to the master was cracked so I figured oh she’s in the bathroom, let me take the dogs outside to do their thing. Well about 10 minutes later I come back inside and she’s still not in her room so I go peak inside the master to see if she’s feeling okay. It’s dark and I see her asleep on a recliner. So I call out mom a few times quietly and then go to nudge her knee and she is ice. fucking. cold. I finally look up at her face and realize she’s dead and has been for awhile, maybe a few hours. Mouth hanging open staring into the nothing, she’s completely pale and her lips were blue. It was the most traumatic thing I have ever experienced and it has really fucked me up. That woman was my absolute best friend in the entire world. They said she had a heart attack. 

It will be 7 years this July and the thought of seeing her like that still makes my anxiety skyrocket.

AskReddit,What is the worst physical pain you have ever experienced?,"I am one of a small percentage of people who when quickly detoxing from heroin, actually came close to dying. Alcohol and benzodiazepines are typically the two substances that kill people when they try to quit suddenly. Heroin it just FEELS like your going to die but 99% of the time you don’t. In 2011 after many attempts I finally gave up on the stuff and hid myself away in my apartment. About 12-18 hours in I got all the usual symptoms, within about a day I had a headache so bad i could barely walk, about 36 hours in the headache had turned into what I can only describe as someone taking a wide gauge knitting needle and shoving it through the back of my skull and swishing it around my brain, I got “hot” white spots in my vision that would expand and contract with the pain levels and as they expanded I went blind, I lost a bunch of motor function and the only thing I could do is scream bloody murder and I actually peed myself as I crawled to the front door of my apartment. 

My neighbors thinking I was being assaulted or worse called the police and they arrived pretty quickly and I told them everything, was rushed to a local hospital and went through a bunch of tests they discovered that my brain was bleeding from acute opioid withdrawal. The silver lining to that is it allowed me to be qualified for medical detox which is something typically only reserved for alcohol and benzos in my area. So yeah definitely the worst pain ever, if I had a gun in my hand at the moment I would have been fully prepared to end it all given the level of pain.

12 years later, and many struggles I am about 10 years free from opiates and almost 3 from everything else. Sobriety is a gift. Thanks for reading my novel"

I’m married to a nurse. No, there’s no roleplay. Not that she wouldn’t be down, it’s just my secret thing.

I have no idea how it started, I just like the vibe they give off and the quasi-professional dress they affect from time to time with the tight business pants and rumpled buttoned up blouse. 

I’m not a creeper, I don’t lurk or force interactions. I feel like people, especially women, should be left the fuck alone at work. But, you know, I’ll steal a glance or two here and there or get in their check out line. It’s all above board.

AskReddit,(Serious) what’s something that mentally and/or emotionally broke you?,"My fiancée died the day after we got engaged.

Edit: you guys are alright. I’ve been working all day but I’ll fill in some details when I get home. For now I’ll say there were no drugs or alcohol involved. She was fine, then sick, then gone in less than 24 hours. 

To those with sincere words, I truly appreciate it. To those making jokes, bring it on. Humor is one of the ways I’ve coped with things through the years.

Edit 2: (this shits a downer, so don’t read if you’re not up for it)

She died of meningitis. We spent an awesome day together while she was back in town from college and I asked her that afternoon. Later, she said her legs were going numb and her back hurt. We went to the hospital because they had just had a whole presentation about the symptoms of meningitis at her school. The doctor did some tests and said everything was negative l, so they sent us home. We went to bed thinking everything would be fine. I woke up sometime around 2am and looked at her. She was covered in sweat and turning blue so I picked her up and carried her to the car. We hauled ass back to the ER but she stopped breathing before we got there and didn’t regain consciousness again. At least I was holding her hand the whole way. The doctor did say they got her heart started a couple times, but all of her organs failed and her body completely shut down so they had to call it. Later, they asked if I wanted the ring. But they said they had to cut it off because her body had swollen so much. I told them to keep it because I wouldn’t have been able to handle what it meant if it was in one piece. 

To answer the other obvious question. I’m as alright as I get. Lately I’ve been thinking about our first days more than the last one. It’s hard to tell if that makes it better or worse though.  Relationships are hard. Anytime things get too good, there’s a compulsion to pull away for self-preservation. There’s no making it through of another round of that. 

Thank you all again for your kind words and thoughts (and jokes). Pay attention to how you feel and listen if someone tells you something is wrong with them. Finally, tell the people that matter to you how you feel as often as you can."

AskReddit,"Redditors who have worked around death/burial, what’s your best ghost story?","I used to be a driver for a funeral home corporation. Like, drive the hearse and pick up the bodies. Never had anything creepy happen, a few funny things, a few traumatic things. In general it was a chill job.

However. I did get incredibly uncomfortable one night picking up a man who died at home, he still had the defibrillator leads on his chest and his eyes were closed, which is unusual because the eyes are always open. He just looked like he was asleep or unconscious. Not rigid or pale or anything. 

I just had this sinking feeling for about half an hour in traffic that he was going to suddenly gasp and wake up in the body bag. 

Then it hit me. 

That would be the coolest thing ever. I’d take him home and he’d be back with his family. So I just kind of drove slowly and turned up some music and sang along and talked to him. When I got him to the funeral home I left him out of the cooler for about an hour while I did paperwork and played on my phone. When I got another call I checked on him and his limbs had started to stiffen. I was kind of bummed. I put him in the cooler and went on my next call."

AskReddit,What's the laziest/easiest way you've lost weight?,"Passively rode a recumbent exercise bike while I played video games. I played a few hours a day and I honestly didn't even notice I was riding. Look down at the end of the night to see I've rode 20+ miles. One day I played games all day and it said I rode over 100 miles and burned like 6000 calories. 

Before I wore that thing out, I think I lost like 40lbs over one summer

Edit: sorry I couldn't reply to everyone! Didn't know this would be such a conversation starter. So I don't remember the brand or model of what I was using, although I know it was very heavy and very sturdy and had a tiny little screen so it didn't block the TV. This was 15 years ago or more, but it was orange and black and want to say the brand was maybe Marcy? The seat wasn't comfy, but because it was reclined and had a backrest, it gave me the support I needed. Really the main goal here is to make it as comfy as you can so you forget you're exercising. I also am skeptical of the 6000 calories thing, I imagine those machines are insanely inaccurate and I didn't read too much into it at the time. It was more the mileage I was concerned with really. My opinion, the best games to play are those big RPGs like Oblivion, Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, Dragon Age, etc. Really any game that has lots of traversal of the map or even relaxing games like the Sims or Stardew Valley. Racing games are good too, but shooters are tough because you tend to stop pedaling when you need to focus. I played on PS3 at the time, but nowadays really anything where you have a wireless controller would work.

To anyone thinking about doing something like this, my advice is to simply stick with it. It definitely takes some work at first getting used to doing two things at once, but once you find the right resistance, the right seat length and the right game to play, you won't even notice you're pedaling. Keep sticking with it and trying new things until you get the right combo and you'll be golden. Good luck!"

AskReddit,What's something sex education didn't prepare you for?,"They never taught us about discharge. They went through periods, pregnancy, gender (chromosomes, gentalia, hormones etc), sexuality.

Edit: for all those commenting that my parents should have taught me about it: my mother died when i was a little kid and i was raised by a single father who did not receive sex ed. I had no sisters and no women around me when i grew up. SO STOP BLAMING MY DEAD MOM FOR THIS"

Edit: I woke up this morning and saw I had 140 comments and the first thing I thought was “well shit, I’ve managed to piss off the damn internet again.”  I really didn’t expect this comment to be so popular.

So I paid and we pile back into his truck, me, foreman, another guy and as we're getting back (2 lane road country-ish), he swerved expressly to hit an armadillo and laughed like a hyena. We got back, my foreman glanced my way, and I shook my head imperceptibly. He nodded in agreement. So we told the guy we had a couple more people to interview (we didn't) and that was that.

Towards the end of the ride, I say to the guy in fluent French that we would be happy to compare our proposal with whatever her people could come up with and it's his choice but certainly we would like to work with  him on this and any future investments.

AskReddit,What is the most shameful thing you’ve nutted to?,"So many levels of shame...

Super horny 13 year old in the early 90s.  No porn at all because the internet wasn't everywhere back then.  We lived in a two story house and the neighbor behind us was in a one story house.  Single mother, two kids (boy and girl).  Boy and I became friends.  Met his mom a couple times.  What they didn't know was that I kept spying on them (I already said shameful).  No blinds or curtains in the back windows, which were the kitchen, dining room and bathroom.  The bathroom windows were frosted, but you could make out shapes.  And it was obvious when mom was in there because of her height and figure.  So, seeing the bathroom light come on and seeing her figure disrobe was an instant hard on for a 13 year old.  

One Saturday night I go to my room, I lay down and spy on the house.  My buddy said that he and his sister were going to their dad's for the weekend.  Mom will be alone.  In my horny mind, I thought this would be a weekend of her walking around naked.  So far disappointed.  I spy in the dim dining room some action.  I watch what I think is some aggressive fucking in the dining room.  I start beating my meat.  I think it is about time the neighbor mom gets some action, and about time that I can watch it.  Keep in mind that I have not yet actually seen porn, and not actually seen anyone have sex.  So, it should be of no surprise to learn that what I had seen wasn't the milf getting plowed on her dining room table, but a house plant being affected by the oscillating fan.  Her kids went away because it was warm and her AC went out.  I had jacked off to a house plant."

They went to this really great jewelry maker so said, ""I have something that is really close, give me a bit and I can make it perfect.""

He worked his ass off and got it done with about an hour to spare, plus the managed to get my window fixed. 

The three of us are the only ones who know. I ended up using that jewelry maker for any jewelry I needed and well I haven't stopped yet.

He was still yelling and moving back and forth between my place and his. 
It wasn't until police arrived and detained him that I went back outside. That was when I realised I wasn't just sweating from fear, but my entire back was soaked in blood. What I'd thought were punches was actually him stabbing me twice. Very ugly scars but fortunately no long term damage."

AskReddit,Does the amount of sexual encounters your partner has had matter to you? Why or why not?,"No, to a point. 

To me, the past only matter in its ability to catch up to the present. If someone has had sex with 50 people but it never has a negative effect on our life together and she still enjoys sex with me, then it’s not a problem. However if someone has had sex with 5 people and all 5 are frequently coming back into her life and causing drama for both of us, or if she can’t enjoy sex with me due to comparing it to a past partner, then that it is an issue. 

So to me it’s not the number, but the affect of the number. With that being said, it’s not something i would ask about because typically if the past is going to be a problem there are better warning signs."

Beyond the pretty much daily occurrence of old dads hitting on her (she was 19 at the time) the weirdest thing to happen to her was a woman with a 4yr old little girl was all excited to get a picture with Tinkerbell, who was busy, so my ex volunteered to do pictures and entertain the little girl while they waited.   


The woman was a bitch about that idea, rudely saying she was here to see Tinkerbell and not ""off-brand"" fairies. So just shrugging it off, my ex moved on. A bit later, she hears a commotion and Tinkerbell is obviously upset, and security shows up. Apparently, this woman was Tinkerbell's bio mom and had taken her granddaughter to Disney, just to violate the restraining order against her.

AskReddit,Why were you ashamed of yourself like never before?,"When i was 18 i started stealing money out of the register at the mom-and-pop store where i worked. i cant even tell you why i did it. i had ne ver stolen even a candy bar before but i started stealing large amounts of cash by falsifying refunds on the register. it went on for about a year and then one day i was called into the office where two detectives were waiting. i had stolen over $17,000 in a year. that wasnt the shameful part.

The shameful part was telling my Dad that i was being charged with 7 felonies but that if he paid the grocery store back they would drop all charges. I dont know how he ever forgave me for this. He is the most honorable person i know and the look of disgust on his face when i told him has stuck with me forever. And of course he paid them back for me. Im 31 now and have mostly paid him back but it is still something that makes me really upset. I dont think ive ever forgiven myself for being so stupid."
AskReddit,What’s the worst physical pain you ever felt?,"Abscessed tooth.

But wait, let me finish.

Abscessed tooth after the dentist removed the wrong tooth, the one next to the abscessed tooth, on the way home when the local wore off.  


EDIT: By far my most popular comment over, damn. Thanks!  


So, a lot of people asking about lawsuits. Unfortunately, that was not an option. This was a low-income state-sponsored thing that the dentists volunteered for, and part of getting them to volunteer was a no-liability thing. Plus at the time I kind of figured I'd probably explained which tooth wrong rather than him just pulling the wrong one. I'm guessing I probably could have held the state liable, but at the time I was much younger and not very savvy, so I never pursued it.  


I've noted a couple of people say that kidney stones are more painful than abscessed teeth. Now I've had kidney stones, and I'm guessing you didn't let me finish:P Also, abscessed teeth can vary in pain intensity, as can kidney stones.  


Anyways, I can't keep up with all the replies to save my life, but I appreciate the discussion from everyone!"

Like, cars parked on the lawn, guys throwing up off the balcony, people fighting in the living room, hundreds of beer cans all over the places, all of it. I go in an ask for Amy, the person who ordered it, and everyone is pointing me to different directions. Eventually I find this girl doing 3 feet bong rips on the back porch. She looks at me and says ""oh shit, my pizza"", then hands me a crumpled up $100 bill and tells me to keep the change. As I'm getting in my car, a guy runs up asks me to do a beer run. I say I have to get back, and he says ""ok, what if I pay you?"". Then he gives me like $20 for running him down the street to the gas station."

AskReddit,What is something you deeply regret doing as a child that still affects you to this day?,"When I was 4 a neighbor girl and I became friends. I invited her over one day to play, we were playing with dog food, it was fake food. Well she started eating it. I screamed at her and called her nasty and was just shitty. Told her i didn’t want to play with her anymore… as it turned out, the poor girl was severely neglected. Her parents never had food so she was basically starving. It didn’t dawn on me until I saw that they were kicked from their home and it was condemned and torn down a year after. I remember I went over to play one time and the house smelled like rotting hamburger meat. Their were cockroaches everywhere. It was traumatizing, I cannot imagine living there. 

I have tried to find the girl via social media with no luck."
AskReddit,"Hotel staff of reddit, what’s the most NSFW moment you witnessed at your hotel?","I worked front desk at a luxury hotel, one night the elevator doors opened & a completely naked woman stumbled out, covered in blood. It turned out that she was epileptic, had a seizure in the shower, fell, cut herself, exited the her room & locked herself out. It was a truly terrifying 25 minutes of trying to piece together what had happened."
AskReddit,"Children of sex workers, how did you find out your mom/dad was a sex worker?","After 2 decades+ of denial, it just is what it is. 

Mom was an addict, so was dad. They split and he was homeless. Mom was on welfare and dumpster dived for cash and was always broke. Looking back, I’m pretty sure she started turning tricks when I was around 12ish? She’d get dressed up and disappear at night, leaving me alone. Later we moved closer to my grandmother, who rented a house for us and my heroin addicted aunt shortly before we found out Gamma had lung cancer. Some other people moved in. I’d go in my moms room for something and pretty quickly just stopped going anywhere near her room. Found sex toys, porn VHS, some latex stuff a couple times; walked in on a “friend of hers” naked in her bed with a hard on watching porn in her room once when I was looking for her. I locked it away in that place that kids lock stuff away to forget so they can keep looking up to and loving their parents like the fucked up shit never happened. 

Eventually mom got a room a shitty motel some miles away and just spent more and more time there. Sometimes I’d only see her once or twice a week. When she was home, it was usually long enough to bring me a couple gas station burgers. She said it was to get away from the madness at the house and to be closer to work. I never asked what work (deep down I think I knew, but denial is a beautiful thing when you’re 13) was and convinced myself it was some store and she was more than happy to let me believe it. 

Eventually Gamma finally stopped suffering and dad decided to try and get his shit together. And I moved with him to the original town Gamma moved us away from. Saw mom all of maybe twice in about a year. Dad did not, in fact, get his shit together and I got shipped to Texas to live with an alcoholic aunt when I was 16. 

Mom and I stayed in *very* loose contact and talked *maybe* on a couple of holidays. I saw her once when alcoholic aunt shipped me back home for a week and I stayed with mom in that goddamn motel. Again, she’d disappear at night. One time I picked up the phone, thinking it might be her, but it was some guy. When I told him I was her daughter and I could take a message, he asked if I was “into some mother/daughter stuff” laughed and hung up. That strung out voice literally haunts my nightmares. 

Now I’m 40. Mom and I aren’t close, but we’re better than it was. She went to rehab and moved to her dream state and she lives in the Rockies. She’s still clean and doing well. She has a little life and is comfortable. We text now and again, send pictures and I’ll update her on my life if something big happens. I’ve seen her twice; once I went to her when I was 34 I think. It was a nice visit and neither of us attempted to talk about the past. I think we were both nervous of the other. Then she came to me a few years ago for my wedding. 

Mom was a straight up meth wh**e, and I’m *suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper* fucked up because of it."
AskReddit,What’s the craziest thing you’ve overheard on a plane?,"I was flying solo into Orlando. The woman next to me was so excited about her new boyfriends boat and was going on and fucking on about how excited she was for this trip.

AskReddit,What perfectly normal word has been ruined by the internet?,"Triggered. This was a term describing when the victim of severe psychological  damage was exposed to stimulus causing them to not just remember, but actually re-experience the moment the trauma occured. Now it's used to describe being upset with something.

Gaslight. This used to mean systematic psychological manipulation to the point when the victim questions reality, not simply lying.

Edit: to clarify, I realize language is ever-evolving. I'm not saying current popular use of these terms is necessarily incorrect. It does however have the unfortunate side-effect of undermining the severity and seriousness of the conditions they historically described."

AskReddit,"[Serious] People who have found human remains, murder scenes or other suspicious scenes, what happened?","When I was 11 my dad and I stayed the night over at his dad, my grandpa's house, one night.

My grandpa had just gotten out of the hospital for something relatively minor so that's probably why we were there. Anyway, I woke up around 4:00 a.m. to go use the bathroom and I noticed that there was a body in the tub.

I woke my dad up and told him several times until he understood what I was saying and then he ran to the bathroom and bent over the tub. I listened as my dad made some guttural animalistic moaning sounds that were the most terrifying thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

I understood that my grandpa was dead, he shot himself, but I hadn't learned about suicide yet. I thought that there was a murderer in the house and that he was going to kill us next.

It's been over 20 years but I can still tell you the episode of fairly odd parents I watched before going to bed and the nightmare I had immediately before waking up that night.

Edit: the episode was the one where they go to the skatepark. Hex Games.

Edit 2: ""Why didn't the gunshot wake you up?""
Because, as it was explained when I asked that question, we can usually sleep through a single loud noise, it's repetitive sounds that drag us awake like an alarm or a baby crying.
Also I probably did wake up from the sound, and the urge to pee is what kept me from drifting right back off. The police seemed to think that he shot himself right before I found him."
AskReddit,"Reddit, what is the most eerie thing that's ever happened to you?","I was driving home per usual and got this random, unwavering feeling that my house had been broken into. I kind of laughed and said “please don’t let my house have actually been broken into” out loud as I turned the corner onto my street. The first thing I noticed when I pulled up to the house were the blinds on my bedroom window. They were yanked around and twisted up. Some guy that lives across the street turned out to have been stalking me and decided to climb through my bedroom window. He took nothing valuable. Just some weird personal items. It was terrifying to walk in and see my things rummaged through. It was even scarier when I talked to the neighbor and they admitted that multiple people in the neighborhood had seen it happen, but they were all too scared of ol’ dude to say anything. The weirdest part of it all (and I mean this guy took some *creepy* personal things) is that nagging feeling I had before I found the remnants of the break in. I swear I knew before I knew, and that was such an eerie feeling."

AskReddit,Outdoorsmen of Reddit: What is the most terrifying experience you’ve encountered in the woods?,"I was backpacking with my dog and about 12 miles from the road and trailhead - so pretty far from people though popular enough that other hikers might be around - though we saw no-one all day.

About 2 a.m. my dog started this really low deep growl and wakes me up. Turn on my headlamp and see his teeth showing and he's right on top of me.  I hear heavy footsteps (black bear / moose?) near the tent.   I leash my dog so he doesn't tear thru the tent and the footsteps move further away, but keep circling my tent.  All of my food and toiletries are hung in a tree in a bear bag - nothing in the tent to draw a bear's attention. I clap my hands - something is still slowly circling - not something a moose would do, and a bear might if he wanted food - but I've got nothing and a really big dog with me.  I decide to step out of the tent with the leash in one hand and bear spray in the other - yelling ""hey bear""...

The footsteps stop - dog's nose is in the air telling me to look right - but nothing in my headlamp that I can see. Didn't hear anything run off, but it's quiet.  I give it 5 minutes or so, get back in the tent, and it starts up again - slowly circling maybe 50 feet from me.  Maybe an hour later, I hear the footsteps wander off into the woods.

At dawn, I take the dog, and the bear spray, and start looking for tracks.   I find a clear path in the leaves that had been trampled, but no tracks. The dogs nose is on the ground, and I follow his lead - and he follows the loop around our campsite.  We final see a few human footprint - not shoe tracks - a regular size (not bigfoot) bare human foot. Plus - yup a human turd and toilet paper.  Some ahole was wandering around the middle of nowhere, near the tent and circling my tent for an hour or more, and left a dump for me to find.

ETA to reply to common questions. / themes in the comment replies:

1: **Hiking and backpacking is incredibly safe**. I've been doing this for decades, and this is the only weird experience I've ever had.  The hiking community is incredibly friendly.  The trails have become more crowded since covid, and your definitely seeing more people on trails, and less trail courtesy (litter - leaving dog poop bags,  pooping too close to the trail and not burying you poop).  Also - I was very far away from civilization. Bad guys don't hike 12 miles to do harm, and I'm pretty sure they don't carry toilet paper. The only incident that I know of was of an emotionally disturbed person stabbed 2 hikers in a Adirondack shelter somewhere in the  southern part of the Appalachian trail 5 or 6 years ago. I've hiked thousand of miles without a single dangerous human interaction.

2: **I don't hike with a gun**. They are too much weight to add for me on long multi day hikes. I'm hiking in the northeast - the biggest predator to fear are black bear, coyote and bobcats. All of those are afraid of humans, especially this far from civilization.  If I were in Mt Lion, grizzly of wolf territory - I would carry a gun, Moose are scary and huge, and are not afraid of anything, especially in the fall rut period when testosterone kicks in. You need a really big big caliber gun to stop a moose from charging, and that's a heavy gun.  I've crossed paths with a moose 3 or times, but they are so big, you can usually hears them crashing around long before you see them. I've never had a stare down - but my plan has always been that bear spray would disorient them enough for me to find someplace safe.  The biggest predator - humans.  But see point 1 above.

3. **What I think happened?** Much as I'd love to say it was a young sasquatch, a skin walker or a wendigo - I'm guessing it was a disoriented backpacker that left their tent to crap, and got confused. I was hiking a somewhat popular long loop trail, and I believe someone was probably hiking the opposite way, and stopped somewhere of trail ahead of me. I was backwoods camping - not at a campground.  Regulations are that you need to be 200 feet off the trail and into the woods to set up a camp.  So they could have been a quarter mile ahead on the trail and I wouldn't have known unless they were noisy (or smelly enough for my dog  to let me know).  The most likely explanation is that they were heavily under the influence, got up to crap, and got lost on their way back to their tent, and found my site. They approach my tent and realized they were wrong, and  tried to find their way back to their camp. Then they heard my dog, and me yelling to scare off a bear, and either thought we were a risk to them, or too lit to answer back.  The circle around my camp was several hundred feet - and my tent wouldn't be visible for most of the loop - I was camping  between several spruce trees.

4. **I didn't get back to sleep!**  I couldn't get back to sleep. It was late Sept and sunrise was around 6 a.m.  When we found the poop pile, I relaxed - I really  didn't think there would be anyone nearby as we were in a very tough area to get to - requiring going  over 2 mountain summits from my direction, and 6 other mountains in the other direction. The total hike was about 40 miles IIRC.  We were going to be out for 3 nights, and 4 days.  After I realized it was a human, my first assumption was that there was a lost hiker. I texted a friend that does Search and Rescue in the area t see if there were any reports of lost or overdue hikers. If there had been, I would have had my dog try to follow that trail to see if I could have found their campsite. As no one was missing,  we broke camp and went on our way.

**5. Yes - he was the best dog ever.**  I lost him about 5 years ago. I knew that dog would die for me. Several years after this incident, I got diagnosed with cancer. \*\*(\*\**ETA - I've been in remission for several years and things look good)*  This dog was so in tune with me that he knew how shitty I was going to feel before I did. He would walk with me to the bathroom, and sit right next to me as a puked my guts up. He'd walk me back to bed and let me rest my hand on his back if I needed a little help walking. Everyone has a heart dog - he was mine.  I swear he knew I had cancer before I did. He used to sniff me right where my tumor was located.  I still get teary eye'd thinking of him. Rest in peace big guy.

**6 - I've been asked to post a pic of the dog. I don't think it's allowed here. I tried posting in my profile, but not sure if that's visible to all. I did jut cross post to** r/LetsReadOfficial **and included a picture.**. -edit: check that - not showing the either.  Check the profile."

AskReddit,Individuals who do drink: how are you able to limit yourself to just a couple and not result into 16-18ish beers?,"Hey friend. So, you and I sound alike. It took me a long time to realize that what I thought was a normal thought ""look at all that booze! I can drink as much as I want!"" really wasn't what everyone else was thinking.

I am not a normal drinker. I cannot have 1, 2 or 3. I am hard coded to keep going. Not sure where that comes from but I can confirm, after 30+ years of field testing, that for me, it's true. 

So, I had the choice, ultimately, to keep going or stop. I stopped, eventually. 

I think you have discovered, much earlier than I did, that you see the world differently than others. That's a great thing to know.

The r/stopdrinking sub is filled with questions like this and others. You might find it useful.

I hope you figure things out. Be well.

Edit: Wow. I did not expect a response like this. Thank you for the kind words and awards. It made my day. Sincerely, thank you.

Not everyone has a drinking problem but those that do, I think, do not immediately recognize it as such. The challenges of addiction are multiple. Several people commented on ADHD, attending therapy, pharmaceutical use, etc. There are many things to look at and try to understand for yourself. Bits and pieces of information start to help you understand how you got to the place where you are now. However, my solution, my sobriety plan is mine. It is not one size fits all. That is part of the work of sobriety. It starts with OP's genuine question. Inquisitiveness can lead to progress. The key is to keep trying and hold fast."

AskReddit,"Russians of Reddit, what do you think of Wagner’s rebellion?","yesterday i fall asleep at 12 pm (gmt+3) thinking that tomorrow ill have a great time, my friend will be graduating tomorrow and we will have a lot of fun. today at 9 i woke up and open the news in order:

- the commander of the most repulsed mercenary army, whose ads have been hanging on many banners in russian cities, announces a bloody march on the city where I live

- russian commanders gently call for them to lay down their arms because we are ""brothers of the same blood""

- videos arrive of ordinary civilians calling on Wagner soldiers to retreat

- anti-terrorist operation mode is announced in my city, around the time I fell asleep

- putin's urgent address comes out, around the same time I woke up. My family is urgently preparing documents and passports

- day and night me and my friends hear helicopters honking, the whole city is cancelling graduation parties. parks, museums and cafes are closed, as if there was a quarantine. there are bomb threats everywhere

- The Wagner military units capture military facilities in TWO REGIONS in one night. Just look at the map. It's like... almost an entire state. The distance from rostov to voronezh is 500 km, from voronezh to moscow is 500 km (update: wagner has reached the Lipetsk region, that means they have to drive 400 km to moscow)

- bridges are blocked, roads linking the regions are blocked too. from Rostov the roads are closed. the ring-roads around moscow are fenced with military equipment. rivers are blocked. along with buses, tanks and military vehicles drive along one road, people in masks put sandbags. the whole online city map is red with ""STOP"" symbols on each road leading from the south of the city to the center

- the internet is up and down. the same goes for some of social networks

- 17 hours have passed since the riot started. 25,000 heads of mercenary army against the forces of an entire country. Wagner suffers minimal losses. The Russian Armed Forces have 180 men in captivity, three lost helicopters and two armored vehicles. Its just unbelievable that there are no civilian casualties except for a couple of casualties. I didn't think the war would reach moscow. And I didn't believe people who said that Prigozhin would stage an uprising. 
What do I think about the uprising? Nah, I can't think right now. I am sitting on pins and needles, waiting for the danger signal to come so i can rush out of the country at full speed"

This happened very recently also :/

(Edit: a lot of people asked if I went to the funeral. I did, and I’m so happy I did. It rly helped me find some closure and take some time with my family.

Lastly, therapy. Play therapy for the young'uns. It's the best.

AskReddit,What paranormal activities have you witnessed?,"One weekend, I was at my dads house. He’d come to the upstairs bathroom to get a shave and heard footsteps in my step-sisters room. I thought it was him walking around initially, so I got up to find him standing at her closed door. He looks back at me and whispers “you can hear that too, right..?” I nodded and he opened the door slowly. My step sister was asleep, and never had been awake apparently (there was no way she could have crossed the room, gotten in bed, and pretended to be THAT convincingly asleep in the 2 seconds it took my dad to open the door). He went in, checked her TV which had never been on (she had one of those big ones from the 90s that would get warm when turned on), the radio hadn’t been on either (figured maybe it was the beat of a song or something). After that, we heard the footsteps a bunch of times, usually very early in the morning. Some of the footsteps were so heavy, they’d shake the ceiling fan of the dining room directly under her bedroom and they’d woken her up a few times as well 

Whenever I’d shower at my dads, I always felt like someone was standing behind me. Eventually, I got so stressed and paranoid that I refused to shower at the house or even go into the upstairs bathroom. My dad asked me one day “do you ever feel like someone’s in the shower with you when you’re here?” After months of me feeling that way and never mentioning it to anyone"

AskReddit,What to do when your partner has a lower sex drive than you?,"You have three options. 
1. Accept that they have a lower sex drive and deal with it. 
2. Don’t accept it, break up and move on. 
3. Sit down and have a conversation to try to find some middle ground you can both accept. If this fails, see options 1 and 2.

**Edit**

Well this got some attention. Been seeing some duplicate comments in response and want to address them. 

There are no other numbers. Just those three. “But what about…” No. all of them are included above. 
- Masturbation - The would be included in number 1 as part of “…deal with it,” in number 2 by necessity since you’ll be single and number 3 because you still probably wouldn’t be getting as much as you want. It doesn’t need its own number. 
- Cheating - No. Just no. If you can’t get everything you need in a relationship from your partner then you need follow the three steps above. Cheating is never okay. Only assholes cheat. Don’t be an asshole. 
- Open relationship - Part of the middle ground in number 3. 
- Allowed visit to sex worker - See Open relationship. 
- Sex toys, porn, etc - See Masturbation. 
- Talk to a doctor or therapist - Part of the conversation and middle ground in number 3. 

Credit to those below who mentioned these things so I could mention them here. 

Seriously. If you are having any sort of problem in your relationship then you need to communicate. Nothing will get fixed if you don’t communicate. If you can’t communicate for some reason or the communication resolved nothing then you either have to accept it and stay in the relationship or break up and try to find someone that will fulfill your needs.

My 5'0 110 pounds wife sleeps in a marshmallow with 7 thousand pillows and 52 cushions, nesting between six duvets, with a room temperature good enough to make bread. It takes me half an hour every morning to dig her up from the softest rubble to get her out of bed.

I snore. She kicks and elbow like a Muay Thai champion. 

Her bathroom has enough potions and jars that OSHA has written her several warnings. Her shampoos, plural sorely needed, smell like brunch.
My bathroom needs, and has, a forced ventilation system large enough that she could easily be sucked into the vents.

Hope that is enough detail."

AskReddit,What's the weirdest / most disgusting thing you've ever seen at a party?,"I met this man on three separate occasions, and I literally only ever knew him as “The Captain”.

I don’t do drugs, but my friends certainly did. We were at a party and my buddy asked some girl where he could find some Molly, and she says “you’ll have to talk to the captain” and just walks away. We were absolutely fucking mystified as to what that meant. Like an answer to our prayers, the crowd splits for a second and this dude with a comically large pirate hat just appears right in front of us.

My friend goes “are you…the captain?”. Without a word he smiles, and takes off his hat revealing a massive bag of gatorade-blue molly that was taped to the inside. Then he hands my buddy a little dime bag, gives a very convincing “yargh”, and disappears into the crowd. I laughed so hard I almost puked, and I swear every time I saw this dude it was like he was some mysterious pirate deity that would suddenly appear with the sole purpose of giving people free drugs and then disappear again. 

Really more awesome than weird, but still my favourite party story to tell."

AskReddit,What's the most horrifying real-life death you've heard about?,"I was coming home from baseball practice in high school, and when coming down my street I see my neighbor across the street outside in the drive way crying. She was 6, and it was pouring. 

I ask her what was wrong and all she said was “Amy is in the closet”. I said what?? Her parents weren’t home nor where mine. I didn’t want to have her explain it so I asked her to show me. We go in her room, and she is hanging in the closet with a noose around her neck, blood everywhere from slitting her throat and wrist. I picked her sister up as she was sobbing and held her and called 911. I went to feel her pulse to make sure she didn’t have one (I was 16 i had no idea what to do). 

We sat outside on the porch until the police came. I couldn’t get ahold of their parents as I didn’t have their phone numbers and the youngest daughter didn’t know. 

The mom and dad came home and it was just awful. The scream the mom made will always haunt me, and obviously that whole scene will haunt me. 

It isn’t as horrific as these stories are, but to me, this was just as bad.

Edit: Changing the name of the girl out of respect"
AskReddit,What is legal and should become illegal?,"It should be illegal to blatantly lie to voters while running for political office. We call it fraud and jail people for lying in order to gain financially. Yet we call it normal and allow politicians to lie in order to gain votes for political offices, offices which not only benefit them financially but also give them enormous amounts of power to benefit and detriment others.

Then we wonder why political office seems so often to attract the most fraudulent, sociopathic, and dishonest among us.

The paper that came with the bag explained what the different gems were and what they ""meant"".  The hematite supposedly protected from bleeding.  Ten year old me put that in my pocket and carried it with me everywhere.  I carried that piece of hematite for 30 years in my pocket.  

I'm 40 now.  Went on a trip last year and the shorts I was wearing developed a hole in the pocket that I was not aware of.  The hematite fell out somewhere in my journey and I lost a 30 year old friend.  I'd look for that first."

I then spent the next 30-40 minutes slowly scooping the liquid shit out of the toilet that wouldn't flush (with my bare hands) into the trashcan.

Not gonna lie I’m a little jealous

Edit: so many bitter people in these replies! 
Makeup is a hobby. It might not be one that you enjoy but that doesn’t invalidate it. 

We should respect and uplift all women and however they choose to express themselves, wether it’s by wearing makeup and miniskirts or carhartts and axel grease."
AskReddit,What’s something that’s incredibly full of shit that nobody really realizes?,"Some charities. I've been a volunteer most of my life and a really ramped it up the last 6 years. I used to support several charities until I decided to disassociate from a couple of them because of the misuse of money. One of them in particular had two people that founded it and one of them quit suddenly for no reason. The other one, was always giving me the skunk eye whenever I showed up to help. If I'm using my personal time to volunteer, I don't need an attitude from one of the founders.
 The breaking point for me was seeing one of the biggest and most expensive BMWs in their parking spaces that the founder had purchased with a donated money. I've since learned that any 501c3 charity can use up to 97% of donation money on expenses with only 3% going to the intended recipient. I don't know if that's a national thing or just in my state but I know that's a fact from where I am.
 When people donate to me to help buy Star Wars toys for the kids in the hospital, I always post all the receipts online and any checks that cover the cost and always show pictures of me buying the toys and dropping them off every single time. I want to stay 100% transparent with every transaction. 100% comes in and 110% goes out because my wife and I kick in $$$ as well. I don't have any overhead so there's no reason for me to take a penny. I considered a huge privilege to be able to help others in need and I enjoy making people smile.
There are websites you can go to to look at reviews and the transactions of charities that you might be giving to and can make decisions on whether to continue to give or move your donation money elsewhere."
AskReddit,Do you pee when you’re showering? Why or why not?,I've accidently pavloved myself into having to every time.
AskReddit,How would you describe depression to someone who's never had it?,"For me it was fatigue that was so intense I would avoid even going to the bathroom for as long as possible just to stay in bed.
The second thing was this dark awareness that there isn’t really anything that I’m longing for that would make a difference. For example, when you have a flu or something and you lay in bed feeling like crap, you know that in a couple days you will feel better. When I was depressed, there was no relief to look forward to. No light at the end of the tunnel. I couldn’t think of a single thing that would make me happy.

Edit:
I can’t believe how many people have responded to this and not because it isn’t a common issue. I’m shocked I have worded my answer in a manner that has resonated with so many and I hope you find your way to a better life just like I did. Those who have experienced the same despair are so eager to help that it is heartwarming to see all the effort and advice in the comments."

Edit: I wrote finished an assignment for marketing and opened my Reddit to see “3,000 upvotes” uhm… thank you for liking my butthole assault lmao.

AskReddit,"[Serious] Non-religious people, who are anti-abortion, why?","I am not religious.

I am *morally* against abortions (for non-medical reasons) because I believe it's a tragedy. It's a life that could have been and has been snuffed out before it ever had a chance. If it's deemed medically necessary to preserve the life of the mother then that is different.

I am *legally* pro-choice because I don't believe someone has a right to the body of someone else. Even if they need that body in order to survive.

It is perfectly acceptable to have a moral opinion, and a legal opinion, that are in opposition to each other. It simply means you understand that your morality should not dictate what other people can and cannot do. 

This is something that I feel has been largely lost from public discourse. The ability to have nuance. To say ""I don't like X. But I understand that my personal views do not, and should not, constitute laws. Instead we need to look at the deeper issues and decide if a law is truly necessary, or if it should be left to the individual.""

In almost all cases I believe issues should be left to the individual."

AskReddit,"People who've lost a lot of weight, how did you do it?","Ate less, ate healthier, and exercised.

I didn't make a lot of big changes at once either. First thing I did was cut sodas out of my diet.

Couple of weeks after that started ordering small meals at fast food places instead of large ones.

Then I started eating cucumber slices instead of chips/fries.

Then instead of eating shit like candy bars, I switched to chocolate covered fruit, and eventually to just regular fruit.

Stuff like that.

As for exercise, again, nothing major. First change was walking once around the block I lived on. For weeks that was it.

Then I started adding in bicep curls. Then situps. Then pushups. Then light stretches.

AskReddit,What is the perfect example of a couple that’s portrayed as having the “perfect love story” but in reality is very creepy?,"Latin American rural grandparents. You'd be surprised how often the 50 year anniversary of some lovely abuelos in a random Mexican rural village started with what basically amounts to parent-consented kidnapping and rape of a minor.


Edit: I may have dropped this without much context, so here it goes:


In rural Mexico it was scary common for men to just kidnap teenage girls to take as wives, often with parental consent (and often in exchange of farm goods or hard cash). Nowadays it doesn't happen as commonly, save for some indigenous tribes in Oaxaca, but entire families were born from kidnapped brides.


In light of the recent feminist movement in Mexico, these accusations were brought to light, exposing just how many people's families hid this in plain sight, often portraying the abuelitos (grandparents) of the family as loving couples with old-timey heart warming love stories, when reality is often closer to a horror story.


Edit 2: Apparently I'm racist now... Even though I'm mexican... Western professional ofendees strike again."

That I wanted to hide the relationship from her, but that it would be difficult to do if I wasn’t back in time for curfew, because she would ground me and take away my car.

He was so ecstatic that he immediately took me back to my car. I hid from him for a few years, but ran into him at a gas station when I was 19. I swear I could feel my heart stop beating. Years later I heard he was caught in an FBI sting for online predators and went to prison."

one of my friends introduced a woman to him so he can hook up. they went to dinner and I heard the woman liked him. so she invited him to her place to watch a movie together. he agreed, and just 2 blocks away from her place, he began to have panic and anxiety attacks out of nowhere and ran away from her.

AskReddit,People who are no longer best friends with someone: What happened?,"Over 10 years of friendship. We travelled together, worked together, he was the best man at my wedding. We were best friends, the kind of friend you could call any time of day or night and he’d be there to help. I was there for him through difficult times and vice versa. Then he met his now wife…

Suddenly any gatherings at my house they couldn’t attend because she was always sick from “something she ate”…

She was from a wealthy family, the kind that literally owns a small island, and lived in an affluent neighbourhood. It’s not like I was poor or lived in a bad neighbourhood but by comparison, I’m sure the very thought of her being in my part of town made her sick. 

Anyway, I moved overseas, received a save the date for their wedding but the invitation never showed up. He reached out asking if I was coming and was shocked I hadn’t got the invitation as he wanted me there but it was too late to make arrangements and a long way to travel.

I received an email from him while he was on his honeymoon telling me how jealous he was of me and my career and new life overseas.

I travelled back to see family and friends a little while later and tried to make arrangements to see him but he was “too busy”… I was literally in the same building as him visiting old colleagues. 

I’m convinced his wife is the reason my invitation got lost in the mail and that it all came out on the honeymoon and now he can’t look me in the face."

Here's the link: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809

The study was mostly done in protected areas to get a better idea of the overall population (as opposed to the population near cities and roads). Also, at the time, I've seen a documentary showing how the study was executed. Pretty interesting."
AskReddit,Using a CPAP can increase the life span of a Sleep Apnea patient by 7 years. What does Sleep Apnea do to the body that reduces life expectancy this much?,"Your breathing is literally vital. You need oxygen in constant and consistent supply to ensure your cells have the fuel they need to continue what they're doing moment to moment. You also need to dispose of CO2 to maintain good pH balance in your blood. When you aren't doing that, you're body as a whole tries to take drastic action to preserve oxygen supply, which is good when used short term, but very bad of used chronically.

So, let's say you have sleep apnea. And at night, you stop breathing. You don't notice consciously, because you're asleep. But you have receptors in your vessels that do notice the change in pH that has occurred because there is more acidic CO2 in your blood now. The body tried to compensate by increasing pulse and blood pressure, to try to force the blood to go around faster and into the tissues more to offload more oxygen. But there's not much to go around. Your body also starts spiking your cortisol to try to wake you up because this is serious. And so you kind of do wake up long enough to start to breathe normally, then fall back to sleep and the cycle continues.

If you stop breathing once and have this response once, that's ok. But if you're constantly doing this overnight, you're not sleeping right, which is bad for you functioning and it's bad for your brain health. Your heart and blood vessels are progressively stained by this, and they are also deprived of oxygen. We don't fully understand all the pathways that produce harm from sleep apnea, but it does follow that chronic deprivation of oxygen is going to harm your normal function in a variety of ways.

Does that make sense? If not I can try to explain better"
AskScience,"Chlamydia is cured by taking a single pill and waiting a week before engaging in sexual activity. If everyone on Earth took the chlamydia pill and kept it in their pants for a week, would we essentially eradicate chlamydia? Why or why not?","No. First of all, there is no single pill that current clinical guidelines recommend as a full treatment course for C. trachomatis infections. A single dose of 1g of azithromycin would be the closest thing we have, but that would typically consist of two 500mg pills, and is no longer a preferred course of therapy. The reason it's no longer preferred is that many bacteria (including C. trachomatis) have been developing increasing levels of resistance to the drug, and even when it was still preferred, it was never 100% effective. Even if everybody correctly took the full course of medication at the same time, the expected failure rate of (at minimum) \~2% would be more than enough to ensure the continued survival of the C. trachomatis species."

Did it happen before?,"Aftershock sequences are normal and follow a variety of relatively well established empirical laws, e.g.,  [Båth's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock#B%C3%A5th's_law) - that indicates the largest aftershock tends to be ~1 magnitude less than the main shock and [Omori's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock#Omori's_law) - that indicates the number of aftershocks decays through time following the main shock. Additionally, in a broad sense the number of total aftershocks within a sequence scale logarithmically with the magnitude of the main shock (e.g., [Reasenberg & Jones, 1989](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.243.4895.1173)), though the exact nature of the relationship between number of total aftershocks and the rate of decay of those aftershocks with the magnitude will depend on a variety of factors unique to individual sequences (e.g., [Dascher-Cousineau et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JB018111)). 

Given the above, while devastating for those on the ground, the number of aftershocks given the size of the two events are not really strange or particularly atypical. The only thing that's a little atypical is the Mw 7.5 event following so closely in time after the Mw 7.8, but even this is not really *that* out of the ordinary. Rather, the Mw 7.5 does not appear to be an aftershock in a formal sense, but rather a statically triggered event (e.g., [see this thread for a discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10vzw0h/can_the_earthquake_in_turkey_lead_to_more_in/) or this [write up from Temblor](https://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/stress-calculation-clues-aftershocks-turkey-earthquakes-2023-14952/) on the potential relationship between the Mw 7.8 and 7.5). Thus, what we are seeing is effectively the cumulative effect of aftershock sequences of two events (with the interactions between their stress fields and other background conditions likely dictating some aspects of *where* aftershocks are located, as discussed in more detail by the Temblor write up). 

Ultimately, while the human suffering is massive, in terms of the geology, and while there are some unique aspects of the rupture(s) - like there pretty much are for any large, surface rupturing event - there is nothing extraordinary about these events in the sense of them being particularly strange. They were large magnitude events that occurred on an active, plate boundary scale fault that had paleoseismological precedent for earthquakes of similar sizes (but a relatively long average time between events of similar magnitude) and that have been followed by large aftershock sequences, as we would expect from basically any earthquake of the magnitude of these events."
AskScience,How do scientists know that 1 Billion crab went missing ?,"There are a lot of ways you can estimate the population of a species. In fisheries we usually do surveys exactly the same way every year to get a general idea of the population size and trends, and mark recapture studies. If you tag 100 Cod and then next year you catch 100 Cod and three are tagged, that would suggest that you tagged about 3% of the population. Actually it's a lot more complicated because you have to correct for things like the tag causing mortality but that's the gist.

The big one though is catch per unit effort. You track the number of boats fishing in a certain way, how many hours they spend fishing, and how much they catch. If it takes three days at sea for a guy with a fishing rod to catch a Cod one year, and the next year it takes six, the population was probably cut in half.

Obviously 100 fish or one guy with a rod is a tiny, tiny number compared to the amount of data that actually gets collected- it's usually tens of thousands of tags or data from every fishing boat in a fishery. Even that ends up being a tiny sample of a commercially harvested species numbers though, so often fisheries management ends up depending on fairly imprecise estimates of population sizes. It's far better than managing with no data at all though, and a drop of 90% is large enough that they're almost certainly right that the fishery is imploding. ☹️"
AskScience,Can social animals beside humans have social disorders? (e.g. a chimp serial killer),"There have been chimp serial killers in the wild.  In 75 Jane Goodall observed a Female chimp called Passion attack and drive off a new mother then eat her baby with her children, then her children were seen doing the same thing next year, although she only saw 3 attacks Goodall realised that within the group only one baby had survived in 2 years.

AskScience,"Is there a 'half-life' of knowledge? For example if you learned 100 spanish words, what is the 'decay-rate' of knowing the meanings? At what time do you only remember half of the meaning of the words?","The two frameworks that come into play here are [Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve](https://teachlikeachampion.org/blog/an-annotated-forgetting-curve/), as mentioned throughout these comments, and Craik and Lockhart's [Levels of Processing model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levels_of_Processing_model).

Ebbinghaus' curves were all generated based on memorizing nonsense syllables, and the interesting bits to pull out of his research is that the slope of each curve changes depending upon how many times you've learned the same information. So if these are Spanish words you've seen 1/2/3x before, you'll forget them more slowly than if this is your first time learning them.

I mentioned ""nonsense syllables"" because our brains try to filter OUT nonsense. If content doesn't seem to have a lot of meaning associated with it, we'll forget it faster than if that content seems to have high value/meaning. That's where Levels of Processing comes into play: we remember high meaning content, like imagery, substantially better than low-meaning content, like random letters or foreign-sounding words. In practice, that ends up meaning that if you're looking at a set of Spanish words that are associated with translated English words (e.g. \[perro/dog, gato/cat\]), and compare that to a set of Spanish words that are associated with images (e.g., \[perro/\[image of perro\], gato / \[image of gato\]), you'll remember the second set of words twice as long.

AskScience,How long have humans been anatomically the same as humans today?,"These are called ""[anatomically modern humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human)"" and the earliest fossils we have are around 200-300k years ago."
AskScience,Why did all marine mammals evolve to have horizontal tail fins while all(?) fish evolve to have vertical ones?,"> Why did all marine mammals evolve to have horizontal tail fins while all(?) fish evolve to have vertical ones?

Both cetaceans (whales n' dolphins) and sirenians (manatees n' dugongs) have horizonal tail flukes because, being mammals, they've evolved from terrestrial beasties which had an erect posture (legs directly underneath the body) and whose spines can only really articulate along the vertical axis. 

You're the same. You can bend forward super easily; but side to side? *Très difficile*! Given evolution only works with what's given to it, the path of least resistance was to evolve swimming biomechanics that utilised a pre-existing up n' down motion.

Conversely, lateral undulation is a basal trait amongst vertebrates - fish, amphibian, and all extant reptile spines articulate 'side-to-side' (with legs splayed out). Hence why they all - be it salmon, sea snake or crocodile - similarly swim with lateral undulation, utilising vertical tail flukes or spines (the direction of the fluke obviously designed to maximise fluid resistance and thereby drive propulsion).

But why did mammals (and dinosaurs for that matter) develop a vertical posture? There are multiple hypotheses, the most convincing associated with something called the [Carrier's constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier%27s_constraint). Lizards and other laterally undulating terrestrial beasties find it more difficult to move and breathe at the same time, as the sideways flexing of their gait impedes the ability of their lungs to expand and contract fully - hence why you usually spot 'em darting about in short bursts, with pauses to catch their breath. Having vertically-articulating spines overcomes this limitation.

Indeed, a reason why dinosaurs were so successful and outcompeted most other reptile clades during the Late Triassic was because of this; the shift to a bipedal gait via things like [*Lagosuchus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagosuchus) through to [*Eoraptor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eoraptor) produced a group of animals that could move about far more efficiently, making them extremely effective predators. A similar trajectory is observed in early mammals (though perhaps more as a means to avoid predation, more efficiently escaping dinosaur jaws, than the other way around).

**In summary:** Evolution only moulds what it's already been given. Whales descend from vertically postured critters, and so their only option was to develop vertically-articulating horizontal flippery-bits. Everything else in the sea inherited the default option, which was side-to-side.

___

**P.S.** As a note, there are no fully aquatic dinosaurs (non-avian or otherwise), so no horizontal flukes to observe - the closest thing, the semi-aquatic spinosaurids, I believe, relied on vertically-inclined paddling much more than undulation - palaeontologists, correct me if I'm wrong!

**P.P.S.** Second note, the vertical articulation of mammal spines also explains why there are no legless mammals (despite some claims about [*Proterix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterix) having no legs) - sideways undulation is much more conducive for trajectories towards limblessness and burrowing. Alas!"
AskScience,"Golf balls are said to be dimpled to reduce drag. If that’s true, why aren’t aeroplanes dimpled?","So the nature of flow around objects is a fairly complicated topic, and the first thing you have to understand is how it changes based on:

* the viscosity (thickness) of the fluid, which is air in this case
* the speed of the flow (or the object)
* the approximate scale of the object

These three quantities combine to one dimensionless number known as the *Reynolds number* which is a good indication of the kind of flow patterns you're likely to see. The Reynolds number is the speed multiplied by the length scale divided by the viscosity, and tells you approximately the ratio of inertial to viscous forces experienced by the flow. More inertial forces equals higher Reynolds number equals more turbulent flow.

Large objects moving quickly through thin fluids have large Reynolds numbers, and small objects moving slowly through thick fluids have small Reynolds numbers.

In the case of the golf ball and the airplane, while the fluids are the same, the length scales and the speeds aren't. Golf balls experience Reynolds numbers up to about 100,000 while airplanes up to 20 million or so.

Now, both of these are in the turbulent flow regime (which begins around 2000-5000 most of the time), but there's no question that airplanes experience vastly different flow characteristics than golf balls do. In particular, golf balls are below the [drag crisis point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_crisis) and airplanes are above it.

An [analysis](https://www.comsol.com/blogs/why-do-golf-balls-have-dimples/) by Comsol shows the effect of dimples in a sphere for various flow regimes (also taking into account spin, in fact) and [this chart](https://cdn.comsol.com/wordpress/sites/1/2021/09/drag-coefficient-distribution-comparison.png) in particular shows regimes very clearly. Around the drag crisis point, dimples become detrimental.

AskScience,"If someone has been muscular in the past, does he gain muscle mass more easily as someone who has not gained muscle before?","Yes. The ""muscle memory"" people are referring to is due to, in part, more myonuclie that migrate into the muscle fiber. These satellite cells sit on the outside of the muscle, but during Hypertrophy training, migrate in to the muscle fibers. They essentially ""control"" or produce proteins for a specific area of the muscle. As you get more Hypertrophy, more of these muscle cells migrate in. When you detrain, the muscle fiber proteins (actin, myosin etc.) Get degraded, but the myonuclie stay in the muscle fiber. Essentially giving you a higher number of protein transcripting devices (that's not exactly how it works but it gets the point across). So you gain muscle faster the next time due to the muscle cells retaining these myonuclie. That's why steroid use is a big topic in sport. You gain a lifelong advantage in many sports by using anabolic steroids. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5086326/#:~:text=Satellite%20cells%20(SCs)%20are%20the,during%20the%20human%20life%20span.

AskScience,Why are coastlines crinkly near the poles but smooth in the tropics?,"Jagged coastlines near the poles are caused by glaciation cutting through the landmass and isostatic rebound.

Smooth coastlines in the tropics and as you near the equator are due to heavier weathering from rain and liquid water.

Ice cuts, water erodes.

This is just the simple explanation from what I remember. Credentials- B Sc. Geology.

Edit: Additionally, I'd also like to point out that there are exceptions to this. Abundance of ""jagged"" toward the poles and ""smooth"" near the equator is just describing prevalence. Citing a smooth coast  near a pole or a jagged pole near the equator doesn't discredit prevalence. For example, Hawaii, being relatively recently created by magma plumes it will take lots of time due to the mineral composition and youth of the islands for them to either smooth out or erode away. Another example is the tectonic uplift along the US west coast.

AskScience,Can dead bodies get sunburned?,"The cells in your body will die at different rates depending on their energy requirements. Cells that require a lot of oxygen to survive (eg neurons) will die within 5 minutes of the heart stopping. Other cells, like your skin cells, can live on for hours or even 1-2 days. 

But will they get sunburned? That depends on what you call a ""sunburn"". Yes they still have DNA and are producing mRNA which can be damaged by UV rays from the sun. However, the pain, redness, and swelling that is associated with sunburns is due to release of inflammatory signals, vasodilation (capillaries opening), and edema (fluid rushing in). There will probably still be release of inflammatory signals, and vasodilation, but without circulating blood there would be no edema and no additional immune cells likely resulting in no change in appearance of the skin. 

In short, the skin cells will still get damaged but the skin won't flush as you would see in someone who is alive.

AskScience,"Many plastic materials are expected to last hundreds of years in a landfill. When it finally reaches a state where it's no longer plastic, what will be left?","Hi. Fellow Plastic Engineer here.

Basically, Plastics are polymers which consists of many small units, i.e. monomers. For example, polyethylene is the plastic, which is formed of thousands of ethylene units, which are the monomers.

When a plastic is left in landfill, it is exposed to sunlight, rain and other natural stimuli. The bonds present between the individual monomers of plastic are one of the most stable bonds under natural conditions, unless they are exposed to high energy sources such as heating or chemicals. 

So over a long period of time, if the plastic is left in the landfill, it will try to breakdown into smaller units, such as carbon, carbon dioxide, or any carbon compounds. The process is so slow, it would take thousands of years for it to be completely gone. That is the prime reason why the alternatives of plastic are being looked upon and novel pathways of plastic degradation is a top research trend currently.

AskScience,Can a star cool down enough and become a giant planet?,"When stars cool down(fusion in the core slows down), gravitational forces overcome outward heat pressures causing the star to shrink, this compression in turn causes the temperature to increase again until the star is hot enough to fuse heavier elements. 

For large stars the final shrink results in a supernova, for small stars the outer layers of the star swell up until they are no longer gravitationally bound and float off - becoming a planetary nebulae and leaving the core behind as a white dwarf. 

White dwarfs are the white-hot core remnants of a star that shed its outer layers at the end of its life. They theoretically cool down by radiative cooling over many billions of years, eventually becoming a black dwarf, although this process takes longer than the current age of the universe."
AskScience,Why cant we put a freezing person into warm water right away?,"So, the short version is that the people on that show aren't medical professionals, and don't know what they're doing. 

#Part 1

If someone is significantly hypothermic (say <31C, or definitely <28C) they are at risk of arrhythmias, which may be lethal. Your heart does not like being cold as cold temperature alters electrical conduction (for a very simple explanation, think about the Nernst equation).

When someone gets cold, one of the body's responses is to constrict the blood vessels that go to their limbs. This means less heat is going to the limbs, and limits further heat loss... at the expense of the tissues in your limbs getting cold (or frostbite).

If you apply something warm to their limbs, your body senses that and the response is that the blood vessels that go there will dilate, allowing more blood to flow there. 

The theoretical concern is that if someone already has a very low core temperature, and you start to encourage blood to flow to their extremities... well their extremities are maybe even colder, which will cool that blood further. When it then returns to the body, it might cool the body down even further for a brief period of time... which might be just enough to piss your heart off and trigger and arrhythmia and the person dying.

This phenomenon is referred to as ""core-temperature afterdrop.""

This concern only comes into play if there is a large temperature difference between someone's limbs and their core temp. For example, they fell asleep in a snowbank overnight while drunk, and their limbs all have frostbite now. It is less of an issue with cold-water immersion (someone falling over board), as the limbs would not be markedly colder than their core temperature.

#Part 2

The problem though is that this isn't really what's going on. Afterdrop can be a real phenomenon, but whether it is actually caused by warming the extremities... and to what extent it is actually a clinically relevant problem, remain controversial.

For example, [even things without a circulatory system (like melons)](https://outdoorswimmer.com/featured/even-melons-get-afterdrop/) experience core-temperature afterdrop, and this is due to the thermodynamics of heat conduction. Not due to anything special in how you exposed that poor melon to heat.

[In addition, in real life afterdrop is typically quite small, when it even does occur. It averages maybe 0.5 to 1C.  In addition, many clinical trials have shown **no** afterdrop at all to occur, so it is not even necessarily a universal phenomenon. While you will sometimes see references of >5C of afterdrop occurring, this notion is solely based off of one case report, and one small case series. Both of which measured core temperatures using rectal temps rather than esophageal temps.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25823604/)

In addition, simply **moving** your limbs ever so slightly is enough to trigger significantly increased blood flow to them anyways. Likely as much as applying external warmth to them.

Rescue collapse is a reported phenomenon that people have hypothesized is due to core temperature afterdrop. However, it has not occured in people with only mild to moderate hypothermia (ie: those with normal mentation). And the reported cases typically have other reasons to be at risk to suddenly suffer a dysrhythmia, such as hypoxia, or even just the act of moving can be enough to trigger an arrhythmia in profoundly hypothermic patients.

**The take home point is that the existence, cause, and clinical significance of core temperature afterdrop is very controversial.** Despite seeing it referenced very commonly in first-aid and survival materials aimed at lay-people, the reality is much more complicated.

#Part 3

In conclusion, they did this because they likely have some vague education in first-aid in austere settings.

However the reality of the situation is:

1. If someone is significantly hypothermic, I want them warmed up as quickly as possible. Water is much more effective at heating someone than blankets.  
2. Core temperature afterdrop does happen sometimes, but it is usually mild and has minimal clinical relevance. It probably isn't even caused by rewarming the extremities. I treat multiple patients every year with severe or worse hypothermia, and it is not a concern that even enters my mind (keep in mind I am *in hospital* rather than *prehospital*, so there are important differences between being in a hospital and being on a boat in the middle of nowhere). I actually haven't seen it occur more than maybe 1C in my career.
3. Even if you thought it was caused by warming the extremities, using blankets instead of warm water to warm someone up doesn't avoid this... as you're still applying warmth to them.

Edit: this got a lot of attention. If you want to read more about management of hypothermia in the modern era, this article by Brown is a good starting point: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1114208

AskScience,"From an evolutionary standpoint, how on earth could nature create a Sloth? Like... everything needs to be competitive in its environment, and I just can't see how they're competitive.","Sloths are highly optimized for their environment. They hang upside down in trees and eat leaves.

Their claws, along with the ligaments and muscles attached to them are designed to make it easy for them to hang around and move in the trees.

Much of their diet of rainforest leaves is full of toxins and hard to digest, but sloths have a four chambered stomach kind of like cows, and that along with gut bacteria allows them to digest what most other animals cannot. Their massive stomach can be up to a third of their body weight when full of undigested leaves, and they have evolved tissues that anchor it to prevent it from pressing down on their lungs.

Their long necks have ten vertebrae—that’s 3 more than giraffes—which lets them move their head 270° to efficiently graze leaves all around it without moving their bodies.

Sloths have a lower body temperature than most mammals, and because of this don’t need as many calories, because of their dense coats and from just soaking up the sun. They can also handle wider fluctuations in body temperature than many other animals.

Grooves in the sloth’s coat gather rainwater and attract and grow algae, fungi and insects, which gives their coat a greenish hue which is great camouflage in trees. Their slow movement also helps them hide from predators with vision adapted to sense fast movement.

Sloths have all of these cool and unique adaptations that help them survive and thrive in the rainforests. Evolution is not one size fits all."
AskScience,"(Virology) Why are some viruses ""permanent""? Why cant the immune system track down every last genetic trace and destroy it in the body?","Virologist here. I earned my PhD about a decade ago studying the mechanisms involved in herpesvirus latency, so I can help you out.

Viruses that establish life-long infections like these are often said to establish ""latent"", or sometimes ""quiescent"" infections. You can think of them as having two distinct types of infections: the acute infection where the virus is actively replicating, and the latent infection where the virus is simply hanging out somewhere in the body. The simple way to think about it: the virus can be active, or dormant.

We can start with basic descriptions of these two states (without focusing on any specific virus) and then move on to the transition between these states.

The acute infection (active) is essentially exactly what you would expect: the virus enters the body somehow, attaches to receptors on certain cells, and enters the cell. From there, viruses have *many* different strategies depending on their specific biology, but in general the virus will hijack the host cell and turn the cell into a factory meant to do three main things: replicate the viral genome, synthesize viral proteins, and assemble new virus particles (called ""virions""). From there, new virions  exit the cell, either by a process called ""budding"", or explode out all at once by completely destroying the host cell. These new virions go on to infect surrounding cells. Hence, ""infection"". The immune system of the host obviously intercedes as best it can (at practically *every* stage of the infection), but the defenses aren't always sufficient (for **many** reasons, and that's the field of Immunology, specifically host-pathogen interactions; not my specialty).

Many viruses have only this one state. Others, like the ones you've listed, can transition to a state of dormancy, which I'll just call ""latency"" from here on out. The latent state varies **a lot** depending on the specific virus, but in general it is characterized by a reduced level of transcription and translation (so, many fewer proteins being made; both fewer distinct proteins and lower levels overall), and no replication. In this state, the virus can be *much* harder for the host's immune system to detect, especially if the site of latency (meaning, the specific cell type) is immune-privileged like neurons, cells in the eyes, etc.

Now, your main question is the ""how"", namely: how do these viruses transition from the active state to the inactive state (and if you think about it for a minute, how they *come back out!*) This depends on the specific virus, was *exactly* what I studied, and we still don't know all of the details of many of these mechanisms, but I can make some broad generalizations. For larger DNA viruses like the herpesviruses that you've mentioned (Varicella and EBV are herpesviruses, as is Herpes Simplex 1 and 2, Cytomegalovirus, and a few others), the viral DNA establishes latency as a standalone piece of DNA called an ""episome"". You can kind of think of it like you would a plasmid in a bacteria. For herpesviruses specifically, this episome becomes associated with the host-cell chromatin, repressing the acute genes and basically chilling out until it is time to wake up. For the alphaherpesviruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV), the latent cell types are neuronal cells, usually in the peripheral  nervous system; for beta- and gammaherpesviruses, the latent cell types are immune cell types.) So this is one broad mechanism: the virus shuts itself down in the host cell, usually in a *different* cell type than those where the active infections take place.

The other, which you've also mentioned with HIV (and other retroviruses), involves the viral genomic material integrating into the host genome. These viruses actually have RNA as their genetic material and have the unique ability to convert their RNA to DNA (this is reverse transcriptase, first described in the late 1970s by David Baltimore, a discovery eventually awarded the Nobel Prize). These viruses have another enzyme called ""integrase"" which allows the DNA to insert itself into the host genome. This not only serves as a ""reservoir"" of viral genetic material from which the virus can re-activate later, but it means that whenever these cells proliferate, all progeny will also have the retrovirus as part of their genome. In fact, the latest estimate suggests that as much as 8% of the human genome is of retroviral origin. For comparison, only 2% of the human genome is protein-coding genes.

Finally, at the risk of anthropomorphizing viruses, why would they ""want"" to do this? Or, stated more scientifically, what is the evolutionary advantage to latency? Put simply, this secondary state allows these viruses to establish a reservoir in the host, evading the immune system and waiting until the perfect time to reactivate and infect the next host. This strategy has proven quite effective.
 
tl;dr - viruses enter into a state of latency by shutting down the majority of the genes that allow them to hijack the host cell as part of their acute infection. In this state, whether standalone or integrated into the host genome itself, the virus is able to evade the immune system and establish a reservoir for future re-activation."
AskScience,"Is there any limit to the mass of an object in the universe? Can something, like a black hole, become so massive that it can rip through the fabric of spacetime, or would physics prevent that, or is there no upper limit to the mass an object can be?","Honestly, we don't know. It also depends on your definition of 'rip through the fabric of spacetime ' since many people would consider any black hole to have done that already.

It also depends on what you define as 'an object'. Does a galaxy count? Or a cluster of galaxies? Both are gravitationally bound, so may be considered 'an object'.

The single most massive discrete object detected so far would be the black hole TON 618, which masses 66 *billion* times the mass of our sun."
AskScience,Does properly stored water ever expire?,"Water is a very stable compound so it won't ever expire.  Pure water contains no nutrients or calories for bacteria to feed off of, for instance, neither does water ever spontaneously split into hydrogen and oxygen - that requires substantial energy input.
However, water is a rather powerful solvent, especially over long periods.  Many minerals and nutrients, including those of which many commonly used containers are made, will readily dissolve into it, thus rendering the water impure.
If kept in a perfectly non-soluble and airtight container - that is, if kept away from literally anything it could possibly ever react with, it should remain pure and unspoiled forever."
AskScience,What causes raised ridges in human fingernails/toenails?,"Several of the comments are referring to bands that run width-wise across the nail instead of lengthwise like you are describing.

AskScience,"Are all modern birds descended from the same species of dinosaur, or did different dinosaur species evolve into different bird species?","Birds existed before the extinction of the dinosaurs. They are closely related to a group of dinosaurs known as Therapods and formed a grouping known as Coelurosauria (""hollow-tailed""). 

So it's not so much that birds evolved from dinosaurs as they are in fact dinosaurs - ""Avian dinosaurs"" - and the only survivors of that mass extinction.

Edit: “only dinosaur survivors”. Lots of other animals survived. It’s theorized that birds survived while other dinos didn’t because they were smaller and more adaptable with a more varied diet that other dino species after the asteroid impact. Kinda like how mammals survived."
AskScience,"Before modern medicine, one of the things people thought caused disease was ""bad air"". We now know that this is somewhat true, given airborne transmission. What measures taken to stop ""bad air"" were incidentally effective against airborne transmission?","Malaria is literally Italian for ""bad air"". 

They thought that the bad air from swampy areas was the cause, because especially in more northern lattitudes, malaria was more prevalent near swamps where mosquitoes prospered. 

They didn't know it was mosquitoes, but rather the bad air from the swamp. Where the mosquitoes incidentally bred.

The solution was to get rid of the swamp by diverting the water to dry it out. That, of course, eliminated the breeding ground for the skeeters, so it was a very effective way of controlling malaria, even if they got the root causes wrong, their attempt to destroy the wrong vector incidentally destroyed the right vector."
AskScience,As you age hair sprouts in places it didn't grow - what's happening with the follicles? Are they new or dormant ones awakening?,"It's to do with testosterone. The prolonged (in the case of men) or increased (in the case of peri or post menopausal women, or women with PCOS) engagement of testosterone causes the thickening/lengthening/darkening of hair which is normally incredibly fine or hard to see. The hair follicles are not new, it's just that the hairs were so fine and/or light that they weren't noticeable before."
AskScience,"Let’s say we open up a completely sealed off underground cave. The organisms inside are completely alien to anything native to earth. How exactly could we tell if these organisms evolved from earth, or from another planet?","First, we could compare certain features that are common to all life on earth. For example many of the building blocks of life such as sugars and amino acids can come in two versions, left-handed and right-handed, which are mirrors of each other.  All known life on earth can only use right-handed sugar molecules.  At the same time all the amino acids used are the left-handed versions.   If we were to find a life form that used the opposite version of either (or both) it would be a strong indicator it wasn’t related to any other existing life on earth.  

Speaking of amino acids and DNA, that’s another example.  All life on earth uses DNA, and that DNA stores information using the same 4 nucleotides, cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T].  If we were to discover a life form which either did not use DNA at all or had DNA which used some other nucleotides it would also be a strong indication that such life is not related to any life on earth."

AskScience,Has weather forecasting greatly improved over the past 20 years?,"Yes,  forecasts from leading numerical weather prediction centers such as NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) have been improving rapidly—a modern 5-day forecast is as accurate as a 
1-day forecast in 1980, and useful forecasts now reach 9-10 days into the future. 

Better and more extensive 
observations, better and much faster numerical prediction models, and vastly improved methods of assimilating observations into models. Remote sensing of the atmosphere and surface by 
satellites provides valuable information around the globe many times per day. Much faster computers and improved understanding of atmospheric physics and dynamics allow greatly improved numerical prediction models, which integrate the governing equations using estimated initial and boundary conditions. 

At the nexus of data and models are the improved techniques for putting them together. Because data are unavoidably spatially incomplete and uncertain, the state of the atmosphere at any time cannot be known exactly, producing forecast uncertainties that grow into the future. This “sensitivity to initial conditions” can never be overcome completely. But, by running a model over time and continually adjusting it to maintain consistency with incoming data, the resulting physically consistent predictions can greatly improve on simpler techniques. Such data assimilation, often done using four-dimensional variational minimization, ensemble Kalman filters, or hybridized techniques, has revolutionized forecasting.

AskScience,"Why were some terrestrial dinosaurs able to reach such incredible sizes, and why has nothing come close since?","The gigantic sauropod dinosaurs were pre-adapted to gigantism - that is, even before they evolved gigantic size they had a number of characteristics that made them suitable for being huge.  And as they evolved toward gigantism, they picked up some other adaptations that let them move further along that path. 

Most of what I’m going to say comes from 

* [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)
* [An Evolutionary Cascade Model for Sauropod Dinosaur Gigantism - Overview, Update and Tests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812984/)
* [Rapid growth preceded gigantism in sauropodomorph evolution](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(22\)01308-2)

The first two references are open access and if you’re interested you should read the whole things. The first in particular sums up a lot of work. It offers five main factors: 

>	1. Reduction in body density 
>	2. Reduced cost of locomotion 
>	3. Reduced cost of respiration
>	4. Lower basal metabolic rate and gigantothermy
>	5. Reduced cost of reproduction

I won’t go into each of them, since the article is free to read. But it’s worth emphasizing that dinosaurs, as opposed to mammals, have a much better respiration system than ours. That includes both a more efficient airflow, and (very significantly) pneumaticized bones. That is, dinosaurs, including modern birds, include air pockets in many of their bones, which makes them much lighter for their size than mammals with their thick, solid bones. 

>	The extensive air sac system of sauropods with diverticula invading most of the presacral vertebral column and the ribs resulted in a specific body density of 0.8 kg L−1, with certain parts such as the neck having a value of 0.6 kg L−1 only (Henderson, 2004; Wedel, 2005; Schwarz & Fritsch, 2006). This is also expressed as a body mass reduction by 8–10% in volume-based estimates (Wedel, 2005). The hypothesis that the light-weight construction of the axial skeleton of sauropods contributed to their gigantism thus is supported. 

— [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)

Better airflow makes a more efficient animal:

>	Since the work of breathing and its energetic cost is directly proportional to breathing frequency and inversely proportional to the compliance of the respiratory system, an avian-like lung-air-sac system in a sauropod would be extremely energy-efficient to operate. The result in the case of a bradymetabolic homoiothermic giant sauropod would be an extremely low energetic cost of breathing per unit time compared with extant mammals and birds (Perry et al., 2009).

— [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)

Since there will certainly be many people confidently proclaiming that high oxygen environments had something to do with dinosaur gigantism I’ll point out that that’s not only false, but backwards - dinosaurs evolved during a relatively low-oxygen period; but that’s probably not a major factor either way for gigantism. 

>	The Late Triassic was the time of the lowest atmospheric oxygen levels of the entire Phanerozoic, and the ability of taking up twice as much oxygen than other tetrapods would have been of great selective advantage. This hypothesis is in accordance with several observations, e.g. both sauropods and theropods increased in body size very rapidly compared to ornithischian dinosaurs, and saurischian dinosaurs dominated the Jurassic faunas. … This review rejects a number hypotheses about sauropod gigantism: there is no evidence for a higher atmospheric oxygen level during the Mesozoic than today. A higher level is not necessary for the sauropod body plan to function 

— [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)

As well as these built-in factors pre-adapting dinosaurs to gigantism, sauropods in particular evolved a series of adaptations letting them move further along the giant pathway. These include long necks, allowing more efficient feeding:

>	Probably the most conspicuous features of the sauropod bauplan, the very long neck, was the first key innovation in the evolution of gigantism. …The long neck allowed exploitation of food inaccessible to smaller herbivores and a much larger feeding envelope than in a short-necked animal and thus significantly decreased the energetic cost of feeding (Stevens & Parrish, 1999; Preuschoft et al., in press; Seymour, 2009a).

— [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)

The long neck was possible because of pre-adaption, and it was supported by some innovative structures strengthening and supporting the neck:

>	Several anatomical features enabled this extreme elongation, including: absolutely large body size and quadrupedal stance providing a stable platform for a long neck; a small, light head that did not orally process food; cervical vertebrae that were both numerous and individually elongate; an efficient air-sac-based respiratory system; and distinctive cervical architecture. Relevant features of sauropod cervical vertebrae include: pneumatic chambers that enabled the bone to be positioned in a mechanically efficient way within the envelope; and muscular attachments of varying importance to the neural spines, epipophyses and cervical ribs. 

—[Why sauropods had long necks; and why giraffes have short necks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628838/)

Why did gigantism evolve? In general, it’s good to be big. The bigger you are, the harder it is to eat you, and you can take advantage of economies of scale - one 50-ton animal needs less food than ten 5-ton animals, for example. For most species, getting bigger hits barriers fairly quickly. Dinosaurs started off with a set of characteristics that permitted gigantism, and sauropods in particular further evolved support for it over time, so they were able to get bigger."
AskScience,"When a male seahorse gives birth, it looks like each contraction spews baby seahorses out. Do the contractions stop when all of the babies are out? Or can some be accidentally trapped inside? How does it work?","Great question. So the males have these ""contractions"", which are more like pushing. They contort their bodies side to side and do little crunches to help eject the babies from their pouch. The babies are very light weight and delicate and are easily pushed around by the flow of the water. As the seahorses do their pushing, water is coming into their pouch and helping to plunge the seahorses out. 

Could a tiny seahorse be momentarily trapped inside, pressed up against dad or a jumble of siblings? Probably under some circumstances, but the conformation of dad's belly and the tiny stature of the babies doesn't make this much of a concern."
AskScience,Over 7000 people survived being infected during the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004. Has there been any research into the long term effects of the virus among this population? Is “Long-SARS” a thing like Long COVID?,"""Postviral fatigue syndrome"" or ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" (CFS) are typically used as a more general name for this sort of condition, and it can be triggered by almost any viral infection (including the common cold and the flu). There's no reason to believe that SARS would be any different. It's debatable whether everything classified as CFS is the same thing, but there's certainly a large set of overlapping symptoms.

[This paper (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162060/) discusses some post-viral symptoms and possible treatments for previously-infected SARS patients. The paper makes a comparison to CFS, but does not directly state they are the same - instead it just places ""Post-SARS sickness syndrome"" in the same category of conditions. [This 2011 paper](https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2377-11-37) follows up on 22 post-SARS patients who are experiencing persistent chronic symptoms. Whatever you want to call the syndrome, this is the most direct answer I could find to your question."
AskScience,"If the moon's spin is tidally-locked so that it's synchronized with it rotational rate (causing it to almost always look the same from Earth), once humans colonize the moon, will the lunar inhabitants experience ""day"" and ""night"" on the moon?","The Moon's rotation is indeed synced with its orbit, which is why it always faces Earth with the same face. But that still means that it is rotating! It takes the Moon about a month to rotate about its axis, relative to the Sun. So if you're on the Moon, you do have a day/night cycle, it's just about 2 weeks of daylight, followed by 2 weeks of night. The Sun will rise, move across the sky, and set, over the course of 2 Earth weeks. However, the Earth will always be in the same fixed position in the sky, and will only move if you move to a different position on the Moon (if you're on the far side of the Moon, the Earth is always ""underground"" from your perspective).

This is actually what causes the phases of the Moon. When the Moon is a crescent or half moon or ""gibbous"" phase, this is because part of the Moon that is facing the Earth is in night-time, and is too dark to easily see from Earth. This isn't the Earth's shadow on the Moon - we only see that when things line up just right during a Lunar Eclipse - this is the Moon's shadow on the Moon.

Hope that helps! I'd also recommend setting down some tennis balls or whatever and moving them around, as seeing things laid out like that can help things to click sometimes."
AskScience,Why do city pigeons so often have mutilated feet?,"Hi, I'm a wildlife veterinarian in a huge metropolitan areas. Because of their natural history, pigeons spend a huge amount of time walking, rather than perching or hopping compared with other birds. Since they're in cities, they tend to gather string materials around their toes, most commonly human hair in my experience but sometimes textiles and synthetic fibers. They get all tangled and knotted, and they aren't able to untangle it. Pigeon toe amputations are the most common surgery I do, but we're lucky they do so well with so few toes."
AskScience,"What coordinate system is used for space, and where is the origin?","I'm going to talk about some of the ones used in astrodynamics, as astronomers have other ones that they use.

Different coordinate systems are used for different purposes.  Ones used for position and velocity are generally based on an origin and orientation that ""fixed"" (or changes slowly enough as to not matter too much).  Ones used for vehicle attitude are generally based on the vehicle's position and velocity, which can change pretty rapidly.

For Earth-centric, in space navigation, the equator is often used as the XY plane with the +Z being the north pole.  But, you ask, isn't the earth's pole constantly precessing?  It is!  Which is why it's common to use the position of the pole as it was on January 01, 2000 as the +Z axis.  The +X axis is set by the intersection of the Earth equator and the ecliptic plane (the vernal equinox).  This frame is often referred to as Earth Mean Equator of 2000 or EME2000.

A common frame for vehicles in the atmosphere cares about where those vehicles are in terms of Earth latitude and longitude.  For this purpose, there's the Earth Centered, Earth Fixed frame, where +Z is the North pole and +X is the prime meridian at the equator.

But what if I care about which direction is ""up""?  For that purpose, there's the Local Tangent Plane.  Say you have a launch vehicle on the pad at a given location on earth and you want to start by flying straight up.  That's what the local tangent plane gives you.  It accounts for the oblateness of the Earth and forms a frame with one of the axes pointing normal to the surface of the mean earth ellipsoid at that point.  There are a few commonly used standards for this, namely the North-East-Down frame (NED), where those correspond to the XYZ axes.  The other being the South-East-Z frame (SEZ).  The difference between the two being whether positive Z corresponds to positive altitude.

For interplanetary navigation, the ecliptic plane is generally used as the XY plane, with +X again being in the direction of Earth's equinox.  There are frames attached to other bodies so that we can define latitude/longitude on those as well.

For spacecraft attitude, frames are commonly aligned to the radius vector and local horizontal plane (so called Local Vertical, Local Horizontal or LVLH).  In LVLH it's common to have +X be the radius vector from the center of Earth to the vehicle, +Y being the local horizontal in the posigrade direction, and +Z being the orbit angular momentum vector.  But there are other standards as well, so you always have to check your references and see how they define X, Y, and Z.

Another common frame for trajectory optimization points the +X along the vehicle's velocity vector, +Z is the orbit angular momentum vector, and +Y completes the orthogonal set.

These are only a handful of frames used.  A mentor of mine once said that 75% of our work in spacecraft mission design is dealing with coordinate frames and transformations.  As for the origins of these frames, it's generally the body that you're orbiting."
AskScience,Why do colonies of insects such as ants or bees not suffer from inbreeding depression?,"I don't know about other insects, but with honeybees, the virgin queen will go on mating flights.  While on the mating flight they intentionally fly a long way from the hive to ensure they're not mating with drones (males) from the same hive.  They'll then mate with multiple drones (which kills the drone) and store the sperm in an organ called the spermatheca.  The queen can then selectively release sperm to fertilize eggs throughout the rest of her life."
AskScience,"When performing a heart transplant, how do surgeons make sure that no air gets into the circulatory system?","Similar techniques as when we’re doing a regular intracardiac operation. We vent the left side of the heart in two places - the left atrium and the aortic root. Head down and we turn the vent suction/kinetic up before declamping. LA/LV vent suction stays up so the heat can’t eject until we see the heart on echo to ensure the left side of the heart is clear of air bubbles. Anything on the right side just goes to the lungs, no biggie."

AskScience,"When metal gets very hot, it turns, red, then orange, then yellow, then blue, then white. Why does it skip green and violet?","The phenomenon you're talking about is ""black body radiation"".

The name is weird, it comes from the concept to imagine a perfect black sphere floating in space, black to every frequency of electro magnetism, that is too say it absorbs everything. It will keep getting hotter and hotter and so must shed this heat energy, but how?

The way it emits heat is a modified bell curve of probability drawn on the electro magnetic spectrum, starting with its peak very low on the infrared. As the heat increases this bell curve moves towards higher frequencies as these carry more energy.

The higher frequencies (or shorter wavelengths) appear more blue than red. You are right that it appears the skip green and violet, the reason is that the bell curve of light emitted is broad, not a focused frequency like a laser, but we don't see the IR and UV which gives us this illusion.

Your order is a little off, but here's an explanation of what's happening at each colour:
- invisible (the peak is low in the IR spectrum)
- red (peaking in IR)
- yellow (the peak is red, but it is also shedding green if looked through a prism) 
- white (the peak is green, but the peak is now so high and broad all visible frequencies are emitting about the same brightness)
- pale blue (the peak is now violet, but it still emits highly in the green frequencies)
- edit: after this it just gets brighter pale blue, it never shifts violet (but the peak is moving towards higher frequencies)

The filament of an incandescent light bulb is a perfect example, the temperature of the filament, measured in degrees Kelvin, is equal to the light colour. We use this temperature to describe the ""colour temperature"" of LED lights which replace them, 3000K is orange 6000K is bright blue. These temperatures are 5000°f and 10,000°f respectively.

[this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/wien3.html) page includes a graph which might help visualise this.

It is a property of all matter, but samples of pure elements will have specific frequency steps they naturally prefer to emit from, you might see flickers of green and blue on a camp fire, this is the same. Tricking these atoms to produce only specific frequencies is how we produce the colours of fireworks, the yellow of sodium street lights, or lasers. 

Hope this helps.

Edit: in bullet points it never goes more violet than pale blue perceivably.

Edit 2: warm light bulbs are lower than 4000K"

In short the heat doesn't kill the pathogen, the immune system kills the pathogen and needs some extra heat to work more efficiently.

AskScience,"If soil comes from dead plants, what substrate did the first terrestrial plants grow on?","Generally bacteria are the first things to colonise bare rock and provide a substrate for other micro-organisms. Simple multicellular organisms like lichens can thereafter colonise the rock. They reproduce quickly and can survive the harsh conditions, and many species don't need soil. Its these plants that start to lay down soil as they die off and decompose, providing a substrate for increasingly more complex species.

What your 8-year old is asking about is called ""ecological succession"" and is the process through which an area can go from bare rock to a rich forest over a hundred years. You can see the early stages of ecological succession all over the place, particularly in concrete urban areas that have been neglected and are in the early stages of colonisation. In fact your local hardware store will sell lots of products which are the armoury of the homeowner in the struggle against the primary colonisers of ecological succession."

Time outdoors here referring to actually being oudoors and not just spending time outside the house.

We are not quite sure why but [one of the hypotheses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001923/) is that our bodies, including in our eyes, produce dopamine when exposed to bright lights which inhibits excessive eye elongation and myopia.

AskScience,"Do people with widely set eyes (ex. actress Anya Taylor-Joy) have a different or deeper sense of depth perception, than those with closely set eyes (ex. actor Vincent Schiavelli)?","People with different IPDs (Inter pupillary distance, between 50mm-80mm) will have effectively the same view until you get up close and personal.

When focused at infinity, our eyes look straight ahead and the field of view overlap occurs around 60° due to the nose obstruction and nose bridge protrusion. Moving the eyes apart changes where that overlap starts to occur, but the sightlines are still parallel. 

The reason it doesn’t make more of a difference is because the angles of convergence (When you move your eyes inward to focus on an object) are very small, less that 1° per eye, until you get to within a 2 meters in front of you."
AskScience,I always hear people say “That will give you cancer”. But how do things actually give you cancer?,"Cancer is a wide spectrum of disease. But the gist is that the regulation of cell division and the proteins they make go off the rails.  This is due to genetic alterations that happen from endogenous and exogenous factors such as carcinogens like radiation and certain chemicals.  Cells may also lose the ability of apoptosis which is programmed cellular death. If a cell can't die, then cancer.  Bacteria and viruses can also cause havoc and cause cancer.  Basically, if there are a couple of errors in the way cells behave, and those errors lead to immortality and the ability to migrate and grow elsewhere, you've got a cancerous and malignant tumor.

AskScience,Why are the overwhelming majority of skeletal systems calcium based instead of some other mineral?

There was an organism with cartilage and it mutated and was able to add calcium to it's cartilage and make bone, this worked well and it passed it on.

AskScience,"If the plutonium core of a nuclear warhead is so ready to go critical, how is it safely manipulated during assembly?","The simplified version: The core is a hollow ball that goes prompt critical when it is squeezed together by de explosive lensing effect of the explosives around it.

At that point a neutron source will be triggered to release a burst of neutrons to kickstart the chain reaction.

Just manipulating the core won't do anything. It's not something like the Demon core."
AskScience,Did scientists know that nuclear explosions would produce mushroom clouds before the first one was set off?,They sure did. [This is footage of an explosive test conducted by Manhattan Project scientists on May 7th 1945 near the site of the later Trinity test.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/9/99/Trinity_100t_test.ogv/Trinity_100t_test.ogv.720p.vp9.webm) The test utilized conventional explosives equivalent to 108 tonnes of TNT and produced the characteristic mushroom cloud of later nuclear explosions.
AskScience,What animals have the most living generations at one time?,"Elkhorn corals can reach sexual maturity in a few years and can go on living for thousands of years as a genetically identical colony, so you could _in theory_ have a thousand generations still around at the same time."
AskScience,"With news of the Titan experiencing a “catastrophic implosion”, what exactly does this mean?","If you're asking what exactly happened, here's what, in the most succinct form I can put it:

* The CEO of the company had this sub built using carbon fiber wrapped around a mandrel, a methodology used for pressure vessels. The problem is that this kind of design resists pressure from the inside because carbon fiber is strong in tension, not compression. It is not proven for resisting pressure from the outside trying to crush it, and the material theory governing fiber-wound vessels suggests that it would fail, but he ""broke the rules"" in the name of innovation. He was widely criticized by the submarine community for this, but he forged ahead. [See James Cameron explain this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rThZLhNF_xg) They were warned that their decisions would lead to people dying, but they pushed ahead anyway.
* Carbon fiber and epoxy composite systems do not fail gradually; when they fail, they snap or shatter because they tend to be very stiff and brittle, and failure happens by delamination, where the layers of epoxy and fiber separate, since they have different stress-strain curves under extremely high loads. Upon delamination, carbon fiber composites lose all their strength. [Here is a hydraulic press trying to bend a carbon fiber rod to failure vs. titanium and other materials.](https://youtu.be/ifOzrOgpI4g?t=226) That moment you hear a snap is when it fails, but unlike a slow moving hydraulic press that needs to keep moving to do more damage, the deep sea would have continued to squish the thing all the way in upon the first moment of failure with unrelenting speed. Notice how it hardly bent at all; strain gauges are useless if you can't detect any strain. The moment any noticeable strain shows up, the material has already failed.
* At the depths they had descended to, the pressure on the hull would have been around 2,800 PSI (pounds per square inch), nearly a ton and a half per square inch. Translated to pounds per square feet (144 square inches), that's 403,200 pounds per square foot. For comparison, the atmosphere is at about 15 PSI, an instant pot reaches about 30 PSI, and an inflated tire is about 32 PSI. The pressure of a CO2 cartridge is 800 PSI. 
* When that hull failed, it likely crushed inward faster than the speed of sound in air. Either that, or the first crack that formed let in a thin jet of water comparable to that of a water jet cutter that sliced whoever and whatever was near it into pieces.

Basically a catastrophic implosion means they likely didn't even have time to react in any substantive way to the first signs of failure before they were doomed. At best they tried to release the ballast to return to the surface as soon as they heard a loud snap or a bang from the carbon fiber delaminating and died very shortly after due to the hull collapsing. At worst, they instantaneously became salty meat paste at supersonic speed with no warning at all. When air is compressed that hard that quickly, it heats up to incredible temperatures due to adiabatic heating. The volume of air in that sub slamming into a tiny volume from all sides at such speed [would have instantaneously heated up to thousands of degrees in a brief incandescent flash as the implosion incinerated everything in the sub](https://youtu.be/4qe1Ueifekg) before the water quenched it all.

Here is a great video explaining the massive stack of stupid decisions by the company that would make any experienced submariner wince:

# Sub Brief | [The Titan Tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dka29FSZac)

TL;DR list of the major stupid things they did is as follows:

* Use of carbon-fiber pressure hull.
* Deliberately hires young, inexperienced technicians because young people are more ""inspirational""
* No subject matter experts on submarine operations and safety on staff.
* Does not use lessons learned from NASA and aviation community past tragedies
* Possible that the atmospheric life support system was not tested
* Test depth of 4000m was not tested at sea before first commercial dive
* No way to ventilate the pressure hull; it's just a sealed bottle with one opening that is bolted with 17 bolts.
* No emergency breathing provisions (such as oxygen ""candles"" or other such equipment)
* No voice communications (on purpose; CEO hated being interrupted by voice comms when he was in the zone during a deep dive, so voice comms were deliberately left off the submarine.)
* Communications were lost during testing but were later recovered during the ascent, and in fact were lost on every descent, but because comms were recovered after being lost, this was regarded as normal thing to expect rather than a serious problem that needed to be fixed. So when communications were lost this time, the surface crew waited 12 hours thinking this was normal before getting worried and calling the coast guard. That's 12 hours lost that they'll never get back.

Stockton Rush (CEO) was warned by an engineer he hired to assess the safety of the Titan submersible, but [when the engineer assessed that his sub was a deathtrap, he was promptly fired.](https://abc7ny.com/missing-titanic-sub-oceangate-lawsuit-david-lochridge-submersible/13409850/)"
AskScience,How does a flower that is self pollinating get enough gene diversity for it to not be damaged by inbreeding basically?,"One factor is that many plants have more than just pairs of chromosomes - they may have 4+ copies of the same chromosome.  This provides protection against inbreeding by increasing the reserve of diversity within any population / region.  So assuming there's some normal cross-plant pollination going on, a few generations of inbreeding isn't a big deal.

Also, inbreeding just isn't that big a deal anyhow, at least not for populations of plants.   The consequences can be harsh for individuals, which bothers us when it happens to fellow humans or pets, but as regards a species, it is a useful tool driving evolution or even domestic breeding.  The fact that some seeds may not flourish is not really a big problem for a plant population, especially if it means some few individuals do abnormally well.
Many domestic animals a highly inbred.  When I worked with lab mice, they were intentionally inbred for 20+ generations to ensure genetic consistency.  The inbreeding helped insure an ABSENCE of (unwanted) defects."
AskScience,What makes rabies so deadly?,"So basically rabies travels into the spinal column and up into the brain, where it then multiplies. Once this multiplication has begun it can’t be stopped, so eventually the person just succumbs to the neurological degeneration. The brain gets so messed up it can’t maintain regular bodily functions and such. What makes it so bad is the viral replication in the brain that can’t be treated."

AskScience,Are Daddy Long Leg Spiders Venomous?,"It depends what you mean by ""Daddy long legs,"" as there are three arthropods with this name. 

1. Crane Fly - obviously not what you mean, and not venomous anyway, a very cool bug.

2. Spiders in the genus Pholcidae - a spider, so therefore venomous. Toxicity of their venom is poorly understood, but there's evidence nonetheless that their venom is comparatively weak. Regardless, even very large Pholcids can't pierce skin.

3. Opilliones or ""Harvestmen"" - not even spiders. These are actually more closely related to mites! Their cephalothorax and abdomen are fused unlike in spiders, who always have two distinct body segments. Opilliones lack both venom and silk glands, and are generally scavengers of rotting vegetation and dead things.

That's quite an old story I haven't heard in awhile! I hope that helps clear things up for you. 😊"
AskScience,"Is diarrhea caused by an influx of fluid into the digestive tract, or the inability of the large intestine to absorb water ?","It can be both. You can have secretory diarrhea where water is actively pumped in, inflammatory diarrhea where the bowels are damaged and water leaks in or cannot be absorbed, osmotic diarrhea which draws water into the colon via osmosis, functional diarrhea caused by rapid intestinal passage that doesn’t allow enough time to absorb water, and a few others (like fatty diarrhea)."
AskScience,How can railway cables be kilometres long without a huge voltage drop?,"Part of designing such systems is allowing for fairly substantial swings in actual supply voltage compared to the nominal.

(The IEC 60850 standard, for instance, specifies that a nominal 1500 VDC system is in spec as long as the voltage on the line is anywhere between 1000 and 1800 VDC.)

System design considerations include the selection of suitably-large, low-resistance conductors, as well as regular placement of substations to connect the high-voltage AC grid to the railway's overhead wires."
AskScience,"If vaccines work by introducing a small amount of a foreign substance to your body to trigger an immune response to develop resistance, why don’t allergies work the same when they also trigger an immune response when exposed to something foreign to the body?","Allergies are harmless irritants that the body IS triggering an immune response against. All of the negative effects are due to the release of histamines, which is an attempt to “defeat” the “foreign invading” substance. It isn’t the bee’s venom, for example, that kills you - it’s your own body’s defense mechanism trying to defeat the venom that kills you. 
     
The way to treat allergies is to shut down the body’s immune response. Anti-histamines are used, but there’s also exposure therapy which is meant to get the body used to the foreign (or perceived foreign) bodies."
AskScience,"Do single-celled life forms have ""behavior""? If so, what internal mechanisms or qualities drive this behavior? And if NOT, then how can they do complex things like chase each other around?","White blood cells (probably a monocyte or macrophage) and other single celled organisms tend to follow chemical concentration trails. They detect Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns which are molecules on pathogens which are fairly common and then move to chase down that concentration gradient. 

Human cells also communicate with white blood cells, and bacteria communicate with each other. Bacteria have a thing called quorum sensing where they detect chemical signals of others of their kind and at a certain concentration change their behaviour. 

If you want to know more about this concentration gradient following behaviour, [this wiki article is fairly good for it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis)."
AskScience,"Prior to the discovery of bacteria, how did people explain fermentation of bread, wine, beer, pickles, etc?","I know a little bit about this oddly because of studying the lore of alchemy.
___
**TL;DR**: We only need an explanation for fermentation via microbes because we assume everything is lifeless until proven otherwise, but ancient peoples didn't assume this. The way they understood the world assumed that everything was alive and imbued with spirit until proven otherwise, and the spontaneous fermentation or decay of foods appeared to them to be the evidence of this.
___
The Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim) who lived in the Renaissance period didn't think of fermentation as being carried out by organisms that were alive, but thought of living things as carrying out fermentation in their various organs. Digestion, the bodily functions, etc. were thought of as your organs all doing some kind of fermentation. Fermentation and distillation were cutting edge technology in those days, and just as analogies are made between our brains and computers nowadays, in his day, analogies were made between various human organs and bodily processes and fermentation. (With regards to some aspects of digestion, this wasn't too far off, since our guts have an entire microbiome that co-exists with us. Our gut microbiome literally ferments the fiber in our food to provide us with certain beneficial compounds like butyric acid and propionic acid, while others make us gassy, and make us fart out gases produced during their fermentation. It's not hard to see where the inspiration for this concept came from.) **EDIT**: For example, pregnancy was thought to be a fermentation process where the mother's womb fermented the semen of the father, thereby converting it into a baby. **/EDIT**

As far as I understand of his concept of what was going on, fermentation was a natural transmutation of substances: gases were produced from wet solids, and sugar was turned into alcohol, or in the case of lactic acid fermentation, sugars were turned into acids. All of this was mediated by a living substance, though they didn't necessarily understand the mechanism nor that there were individual cells of yeast or bacteria doing the work, or even mold in mold-fermented meats and cheeses such as salami or brie.

And the substances that did the fermenting inherited something from their ancestors, and separate ""cultures"" could thus be preserved in order to propagate fermentation with the qualities that they exhibited. In the human sense of the term, culture is what we inherit from our society that shapes how we do things and what sorts of things we do. This same term got applied to fermenting substances such as leaven because each lineage of yeast or starter dough or whatever continues to do what its ancestors did, each with its own 'cultural' characteristics, which we perceive as the flavors characteristic of each lineage of wine or beer yeast, or yogurt or cheese culture, or sour dough starter.

In the same way, our term 'spirits', in reference to alcohol, comes from this period's view of fermentation. When you ferment, the foaming bubbling ferment was referred to as the 'body' of the ferment. When you boiled it, you killed the 'body' (which would not ferment after being removed from boil, and was thus dead), and the vapors that came off of the boil were thought of as the 'spirit' of the ferment as it departed the dead body. This spirit was what they believed they were condensing when they distilled alcoholic ferments into hard liquor. This is why the term used to refer to distilled alcohols is 'spirits'. This is also why concentrated alcohol was referred to as [*aqua vitae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_vitae), the water of life, because it was believed the life of the ferment was captured in the distillate. And each type of thing you ferment had its own character, its 'spirit'/aether, which was thought to be the essence of the thing, just as a person's spirit was a sort of essence of the person. It was thought that this 'spirit'/aether of an animal or person or substance or thing was the 'fifth element', after the other four classical elements that were thought to compose all things—air, water, earth, and fire. That is why we have the term 'quintessence', coined by the French alchemist Jean de Roquetaillade. 'Quint' means five, and 'essence' means element. The quintessence of something was that thing that gave the substances of a thing its essential character—the 'spirit' of that thing. In alchemical lore, this was conflated with highly concentrated alcohol produced by repeated distillations. The alchemical way to capture quintessence is to do seven sequential distillations (usually of an alcoholic ferment), after which you would supposedly have the purest of the pure essence of the thing you're extracting. To this day, when you distill out the fragrances of plants, these distillates are referred to as 'essential oils', meaning the oils that contain the essence of a plant, its characteristic 'element'.

The world view that the world was full of interconnected life, and was imbued with spirit, even to substances like leaven and fermenting dough, is called [*anima mundi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi) (living world, world soul), and it informed the various ancient world views of the pre-scientific era. (And even today, you might be surprised at how many people operate with this world view. In Japan, a lot of people seem to operate under the *anima mundi* world view as part of the culture. For example, Marie Kondo thanking things for their service to pay respect before getting rid of them because they no longer spark joy when she tidies up the home of one of her clients is an example of viewing all things as alive and imbued with spirit, and therefore deserving of respect.)

You can see that yeast was recognized as a substance that grew and spread even in the way it is spoken of in the Bible, for example, [Matthew 13:33, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, Galatians 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A33%2C+1+Corinthians+5%3A6-8%2C+Galatians+5%3A9&version=CSB). But as far as I can discern, at least in Europe, where alchemy dominated the proto-scientific natural philosophy of the day had it that these substances carried out the processes of life, and were in some way ""alive"", and even had ""spirits"" in them."
AskScience,How genetically different are mice that have evolved over decades in the depths of the London Underground and the above ground city mice?,"One piece of information still needed: is there some barrier that prevents these 2 populations from mixing/interbreeding? If there is a separation of populations then you could see changes over time. 

But from a practical view it seems likely there is exchange and interbreeding between all London mice so you might never see genetic evolution quite like the question asks."
AskScience,Is having twins equally common all over the world?,"No, there are some places in the world where the genetic trait of releasing more than one egg in the same cycle is more prevalent. The is a town in Africa where the rate is very high.  The vast majority of twins are born this way (fraternal).

True Identical twins, (mono-zygotic  ie genetically the same, not necessary looking the same ) are equally rare all over the world, we still don't know why the early stage fetus splits in these cases but the rate of it happening seems fairly consistent all over. 

&#x200B;

This excludes twins due to IV (in-vitro) and some other fertility treatments, which can artificially result in twins."
AskScience,"If freezing tissue generally damages the cells, how are we able to freeze human eggs and embryos for birthing later?","It’s actually relatively easy to freeze *cells* and recover them.  It’s harder to freeze *tissues* and have them come back. 

Cell lines are routinely frozen and stored for decades. The [American Type culture Collection (ATCC)](https://www.atcc.org/cell-products/media-and-reagents/cryopreservation-of-cells#t=productTab&numberOfResults=24) has some guidelines and explains “*Most cell cultures can be stored for many years, if not indefinitely, using cryopreservation.*” In general this also applies to egg cells. 

Tissues are harder (though not necessarily impossible) because the structure is easily disrupted and because it’s harder to evenly freeze the cells that are part of it. The smaller the tissue, the better the chance of successful freeze and recovery. Embryos are tissues, with multiple cells, but they are frozen when they are very tiny - at an early-enough stage (100 cells or fewer) that they can be readily permeated by cryoprotectants."
AskScience,"Around 550 million years ago the earth's magnetic field almost collapsed, but then strengthened a few million years later. Scientists say this may have been due to the formation of the inner core. But why exactly would that cause the magnetic field to get stronger?","The [actual article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31677-7) as opposed to the press release (what you linked) does briefly talk about it (in the first paragraph of their discussion), but mostly it's cited out to prior literature. Specifically, as discussed by papers like [Davies et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/228/1/316/6355447), in their words, ""Cooling of the liquid core leads to freezing at Earth’s centre and the growth of the solid inner core, which provides additional power to the dynamo through release of latent heat and gravitational energy"" and they in turn point to thermodynamic simulations that demonstrate this (e.g., [Gubbins et al., 2004](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/157/3/1407/2110839)). Details of core geodynamics as it relates to the magnetic field is a bit out of my specialty, so I'll leave further discussion/explanation to folks with more domain experience, but it's not as though the articles presenting this data do not discuss the mechanism at all."
AskScience,"Is there anything in nature akin to crop rotation ? else, how do plants not deplete any particular nutrient they consume from a piece of wildland as time goes by?","The difference between crop land and wildland is that humans are constantly harvesting crops, transporting them to supermarkets, eating them and pooping them out into sewage systems. That way the nutrients become super concentrated locally and aren't being cycled back into crop lands. In wildlands nutrient cycles are intact because natural decomposition and disturbances like herbivory (animals shit where they eat, so to speak) and fire contribute to the reintroduction of nutrients to the soil. 

Some wild plants are capable of accessing and distributing nutrients throughout the ecosystem through their relationships with mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen fixing bacteria or with various physiological adaptations that alter soil chemistry to make nutrients more available to other plant species as well as themselves. If you have a monoculture crop stand that isn't capable of doing all of these things soil nutrients become depleted, so it's better to plant different crops in different years (ie crop rotation) to ""mimic"" a functionally intact ecosystem. That is crop rotation tries to do the job that biodiversity would have if it made financial sense to farmers to separate their crop species in space and not in time."
AskScience,If nuclear fission in U-235 causes the atom to be split into 2 smaller atoms (such as Kr-92 and Ba-141) then how is it that U-236 is produced as waste since the U-235 was just split into smaller peices?,"When uranium-235 interacts with a neutron, *sometimes* you get fission, and sometimes you get other processes, like radiative capture.

We have no way of knowing what the orbit was before that impact to say it had no effect.  For all we know it was sitting in the asteroid belt or orbiting Saturn when it got hit.
AskScience,Can a planet have a moon the same size orbiting it?,"Neither would be a moon. They would be orbiting a point between them. (Like how pluto and charon orbit a point in space between them, but much closer to Pluto).

They would probably be tidally locked (same face facing each other, like the moon is tidally locked with Earth)."
AskScience,What is a Lobster's Theoretical Maximum Size?,"The largest one on record was 20 kg (44 lbs) and about 1.2 m (4 ft) from claw tip to tail tip (about half that length is claw and arm).  There are reports of larger lobsters from the colonial era, but it's unclear exactly how reliable they were.  Lobsters continue growing for as long as they are healthy, but molting becomes more difficult as they age, and molting lobsters are more vulnerable to predators.

I suspect maximum lobster is a bit bigger than the biggest known...if one was kept in idea environment with no predators, the best in lobster healthcare, and plenty of food, it ought to be able to successfully molt at larger sizes than wild lobsters.  But how much bigger, it's hard to say for sure.  It probably wouldn't be a huge difference, certainly not car sized.  But I wouldn't be shocked if it was possible to get one up past, say, 1.5 m total length.

AskScience,Was the year and day duration the same back in the Jurassic Era?,The day would have been around 30 mins-1hr shorter (as tidal interactions with the Moon have gradually slowed the Earth's rotation). The year has been fundamentally the same since the early days of the solar system.
AskScience,Why are high glycemic index foods such as simple carbs a bigger risk factor for diabetes?,"The higher the glycemic index, the faster the carbs are broken down into sugar and absorbed into the blood stream. Simple carbs absorb quickly, which means that your blood glucose level will rapidly increase. This causes the pancreas to release insulin so that cells will absorb the glucose out of the blood, to prevent hyperosmolarity (the blood becoming too sugary and sticky).

The insulin release will cause your blood sugar to crash, and be stored in the cells as glycogen. This has a dual effect. It will mean you get hungry again quickly, as your brain senses the low blood sugar and sends hunger signals, and you will likely crave simple carbs as you will have learnt to associate these with a quick rise in blood sugar, which in turn produces a reward signal in the brain. This leads to a cycle of eating simple carbs, getting hungry quickly, and over eating. Excess glucose in the blood can be converted to adipose tissue, which leads to obesity. 

The cells start to reach their limits for glucose storage in the form of glycogen. At this point they start to resist the insulin signal.  This is known as insulin resistance.
The exact mechanism for insulin resistance is not known. It seems that the more excess adipose tissue you have, the more insulin resistance you will have. It makes sense as if you have excess adipose, your cells will likely be storing as much glycogen as they can, so they are unable to respond to the insulin signal by taking up more. 

When your insulin cannot bring your blood sugar under control, you have diabetes.

Diabetes can either be a failure of insulin production (type 1) or a failure of cells to respond to insulin (type 2)"

AskScience,"South-west Astrakhan, Russia, has some interesting geographical features I've never seen before. Is there a name for this phenomenon, and how is it formed?","These are referred to as ""Baers Mounds"" or ""Baers Knolls"" after the scientist who first described them in detail in the mid 1800's. There have been a large number of hypotheses put forward to explain their formation, with aeolian (wind blown sediment) being one of the more popular as they do have a similar form to some windblown features, but subsequent work has shown that their internal structure and sediment characteristics are inconsistent with this. At present, there is still not a single explanation for their formation as far as I know, but recent publications have suggested they may be related to deposition during flow of water in a former connection between the Black and Caspian Seas, i.e., the Manych Strait (e.g., [Badyukova, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216301562)) or as a result of deposition during rapid fall of the level of the Caspian Sea (e.g., [Melnikova & Pokazeev, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S1062873820010190))."
AskScience,Can you have TOOTH cancer?,"The white material of the tooth (enamel and dentin) doesn't consist of living cells, so that can't be cancerous.

They will usually be benign and grow downwards into the jaw bone."
AskScience,"Why do feline hybrids (I.e leopons, ligers, etc) often suffer from many health issues, die shortly after birth or before they reach maturity?","The proper development of a healthy adult animal is a series of thousands of steps. The genetic material from the parents has to coordinate in the right way at the right time to make that happen. Genes need to be activated to make proteins and the proteins need to function and interact properly. A mishap in that process can be benign, but is often harmful, sometimes to the point that it entirely stops development (i.e. it is fatal). What happens depends on the compatibility of the genetic material from the parents. 

If the genetic material is highly compatible, the animal develops successfully and can go on to reproduce as well. This is what happens among members of the same species, and is in fact one way of defining what a species is. (It's called the biological species concept.) But sometimes animals that are popularly considered different species can produce fertile offspring. An example of this is the relationship between the [coyote, red wolf, and grey wolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wolf#Taxonomic_debate).

If the material is largely compatible but not entirely, an animal can develop but it may have health issues. The mule is renowned for its sturdy nature, but genetically some step very near the end of its maturity goes wrong, leaving it infertile. To give you an idea of how close to compatible the genetic material is, there are multiple cases of [fertile mules](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#Characteristics), including some who have given birth to fertile offspring.

As the genetic material becomes less and less compatible, the animal will encounter developmental issues earlier and earlier in life. That is what happens with many [big cat hybrids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_hybrid), although some can be fertile. With too little compatibility, the animal may not survive beyond birth, or even may cease developing as an embryo. With enough genetic differences, the sperm and egg won't even undergo fertilization.

Reproduction and development are such exacting processes it's astonishing that they happen at all. There's no other natural physical process remotely as complicated. Slapping a bunch of DNA together under the right conditions sometimes makes new organisms with characteristics wholly unpredictable from the physical characteristics of the DNA. That sometimes the DNA doesn't quite manage to get the developmental process working right is, well, only natural."
AskScience,Does Reading Prevent Cognitive Decline?,"[it definitely does](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32498728/). I'm not sure how much causality has been established though, it could very well be that people less likely to experience cognitive decline are also people who read books.

That said, there's also the fact that people who lose their hearing often rapidly decline in cognitive ability. Continued mental stimulus seems to be required for the brain to stay healthy."
AskScience,"Why do rings around planets like Saturn form as rings, as in why do they have a uniform shape, with all the debris rotating on the same axis?","So we see a lot of disks in space. Galactic disks, the planets orbits around the sun are pretty uniform, and rings around planets form into disks. 



If you have a bunch of particles orbiting something (i.e. galactic center, star, or planet) and they are all going different directions then they are going to bump into each other a lot. When 2 particles bump into each other momentum will combine/cancel out depending on the difference in their direction. 2 particles with equal momentum that collide at 90⁰ to each other will continue on in more parallel paths. 



If you take the direction and momentum of each particle in the cloud and you find the average direction and momentum, you will find, due to collisions canceling out momentum, that eventually all of the particles will be moving in the average direction"
AskScience,Do nutrition profiles of fruits change as they ripen?,"I don't know if corn counts as a fruit, but it definitely changes as it ""ripens."" The kernels change simple sugars into starches as the summer goes on, which is why if you get corn later in the year it may taste kind of gummy and cereal-ish instead of sweet.

There are variants that have been modified so that the gene responsible for combining sugars into starches is not present, so the kernels remain very sweet all year. My father was among the people who identified the gene, isolated it, modified the plant, and then bred the modified plant into healthy stock, which is how I know this.

Also we had amazing sweet corn when I was growing up."

That means you can decide you are stationary and some piece of a star tossed aside by the black hole in the center of the milky way is going near the speed of light.  OR the other way around: it's stationary and YOU are moving really fast relative to it.  If you start \*comparing\* things in your ""reference frame"" and that of the star stuff (like the length of rulers or light waves) then you can tell that you are moving relative to each other.  All this neglects acceleration, which makes things more complicated (general vs. special relativity).  Hope that helps."
AskScience,Why do bowhead whales (and/or other long-lived mammals) not have shorter lifespans due to cancers and age-related deterioration?,"Super cancers. Due to their size, their tumors get so large that they develop tumors of their own that then steal the blood/nutrient supply of the previous tumors causing them to essentially die off. This is typical of a lot of large animals.

AskScience,What’s the reason head lice prefer the head and pubic lice prefer the pubic area? Hair is just hair isn’t it?,"If you look at a diagram of pubic lice vs head lice you will notice the claws of pubic lice are bigger and more suited to thicker hair. The species is more likely to stick on the host in their respective regions because of this difference but that does not mean there’s zero chance of finding pubic lice in the eyebrows or a beard. 

Hair can also have different thickness or coarseness depending on region. Pubic hair tends to be thicker and coarser than the head."
AskScience,Does gravity have a speed?,"Gravitational influence travels at the speed of light. So if something were to happen to the moon, we would not feel it gravitationally until about a second later.

However, to a very good approximation, the gravitational force points toward where an object is ""now"" and not where it was in the past. Even though the object's present location cannot be known, nature does a very good job at ""guessing"" it. See for example [Aberration and the Speed of Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9909087). It turns out that this effect must arise because of certain symmetries that gravity obeys."
AskScience,What is it about the Darien Gap that makes construction so difficult?,"It isn’t impossible; just impractical and expensive. There is little reason for a highway to exist there, except perhaps to complete a line on a map. An extensive national park exists in the way of the formerly planned road, and environmental concerns kept the road from being completed in the 1970s. Later efforts to complete the roadway ran into opposition from environmentalists and local native populations. Journeys through the area are generally done using boats (pirogues / piraguas) rather than foot. A ferry bypassing the area operated for awhile but eventually was shut down as unprofitable."
AskScience,"When it's said 99.9% of human DNA is the same in all humans, is this referring to only coding DNA or both coding and non-coding DNA combined?","Both coding and non-coding DNA. Actually, 0.1% is a little bit outdated. The variance can be higher according to the 1000 genome project. It is said in [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393) that
> We find that a typical genome differs from the reference human genome at 4.1 million to 5.0 million sites. Although >99.9% of variants consist of SNPs and short indels, structural variants affect more bases: the typical genome contains an estimated 2,100 to 2,500 structural variants (∼1,000 large deletions, ∼160 copy-number variants, ∼915 Alu insertions, ∼128 L1 insertions, ∼51 SVA insertions, ∼4 NUMTs, and ∼10 inversions), affecting ∼20 million bases of sequence.

AskScience,Were the gas giants originally thought to be terrestrial like Earth? When were the gas giants known to be gaseous?,"Looking at my encyclopedia from 1887,* they knew its density was much lower than earths .  They calculate jupiter at 338 times the mass of earth when today we believe 317.*  They also thought its size was 1400 times earths, today we say greater than 1300.*  They dont mention what the think it is made of but I think they could deduce it was not like earth.

AskScience,What would happen if you tried sealing the mouth of a volcano with cement?,"Effectively nothing. First to clarify, you're likely picturing the ""mouth of a volcano"" as a physical opening with lava. These do exist, they're called [lava lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_lake), but they're (1) usually relatively ephemeral and (2) relatively rare, i.e., most volcanoes don't have them. Instead, the ""mouths"" of most volcanoes (which geologists usually describe as ""vents"") are already effectively plugged with rocks, usually from the last eruption. When new eruptions happen, this represents a condition where sufficient pressure, both from added volume of magma but also from exsolved gases, exists such as to break through the rock containing the magma in the subsurface OR a scenario where there is building pressure from magma moving toward the surface and a ""failure"", i.e., something like a landslide, removes enough overburden for the magma + gas to break through the remaining rock. Additionally, it's not uncommon for new eruptions to produce a new vent (i.e., subsequent eruptions do not always occur from the same original vent) and vents can occur both at the top of a volcano or the side where the latter is often referred to as a [flank eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flank_eruption). 

With all of the above, even if we assume we're dealing with a volcano with a lava lake, if you hypothetically tried to seal this with concrete, and assuming you could add enough concrete, quickly enough, to sufficiently ""quench"" the top of the lake, one of two things would happen, (1) sufficient pressure would build up to break through the concrete cap if the concrete cap represented the ""weakest"" portion of the edifice or (2) sufficient pressure would build up to break through somewhere else if the concrete cap was stronger than some other portion of the edifice. Additionally, assuming we could, adding a concrete cap to a volcano with a lava lake would be a pretty bad idea as you're effectively taking a system that could erupt more effusively (i.e., lava could just flow out as opposed to explode out) and forcing it to be potentially more explosive by sealing off the existing conduit for exsolved gases and/or lava to escape easily. If we're talking about a volcano that is already ""capped"" in the sense of no open vent, adding concrete would again not do much except either (1) force the volcano to erupt through a new vent or (2) make whatever subsquent eruption a little more explosive as it required extra pressure to erupt."
AskScience,Why are antivirals so much rarer than antibiotics?,"Antibiotics interfere with the metabolic processes and lifecycle of the microorganism.

Viruses don’t have metabolism to interfere with, and they multiply inside a person’s own cells using the cells own processes. You don’t want to kill the person’s cells because killing the person kind of defeats the purpose.

Really the approach for viruses is vaccination; teach the immune system to wipe them out before they are a problem.

If you can’t manage that (there are things that make some viruses tricky to make a vaccine against), then you need to try and figure out how the virus works and see if you can’t interfere with it. Because the virus is really just using a cell to do it’s thing, this is very hard because lots of options are just as likely to kill the cell (so it’s be poison, not medicine). We can interfere with the proteins on the surface cells that viruses stick to and hope that doesn’t do something bad, or we car make a little molecule that gets jammed in bits of the virus involved in making new virus and hope they don’t screw up things in the cell.

It’s immensely complicated to get a molecule into a cell that will halt the virus and leave the cell healthy. Bacteria are so much easier because they’re outside our cells and have a complicated biology of their own with lots of opportunities to screw it up without hurting our own cells."
AskScience,How do invertebrates with exoskeletons experience and deal with injuries?,"The exoskeleton of insects is made from cuticle. It is a material made of protein and chitin, and has no cells. There are two layers: a hard outer layer (exocuticle) and a soft inner layer (endocuticle). The cuticle is secreted by the epidermis. It's kind of like hair or fingernails are acellular growths.

When an insect molts, the next soft exoskeleton hardens, and then it thickens by depositing on the inner layers of cuticle.

When an insect is injured, they repair somewhat similar to us. They form a clot with melanin that seals the wound and serves as a scaffold for cells to move onto for tissue repair. Epidermal cells migrate to the damaged area and secrete endocuticle. This is similar to how we repair skin and bone. The endocuticle has a patch with a clot, so a scar remains, kind of like a scar at the injury site. The injury/scar is usually weaker than the original exoskeleton.

As for the other question about sensation, insects have tactile sensory neurons, and some appear to have different responses to pain than touch, suggesting they have some ability to register pain as different than touch, but no one knows what sort of emotional suffering is felt by a cockroach.

As for pulled muscles, i speculate that they could pull a muscle in theory, but I am unaware of any study looking into this. Insect striated muscle is very similar to ours, and contracts and relaxes similar to our skeletal muscle. I imagine it would be hard to detect an insect that pulled a muscle. I imagine insects probably are less likely to try to pull something beyond their ability."
AskScience,Dumb questions about (sand) deserts?,"A lot of the individual questions center on the same false premise, specifically that deserts are typically (and exclusively) large sand fields. While many large deserts do have areas like these, i.e., [Ergs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_%28landform%29), these tend to actually be relatively small parts of any individual desert. This discussed in more detail for the Sahara in one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/under_sahara/). As explored in more detail in that answer, the surface of the majority of the Sahara tend to be more characterized by ['desert pavement'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_pavement) and/or areas of bare rock, and this is broadly true for most deserts. For the sections of deserts characterized by Ergs, certainly features within the Erg (e.g., individual dunes, etc) move through time and the Erg itself can move via progressive movement of all the dunes by wind, but often things like Ergs or dune fields represent collections of sand accumulated in low lying area so they are semi-contained. For example, within the [Great Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Basin) region in the western US, there are various small dune fields, mostly confined to valleys like [Eureka Dunes](https://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/eureka-dunes.htm) at one end of the Eureka Valley. Of note though, only portions of the Great Basin would be considered a desert and this classification is not based on the presence or absence of sand.

Instead, the definition of an area as a desert centers on that area consistently receiving very low amounts of precipitation, not the the presence or absence of Ergs (or other landforms for that matter). If you look at the various ways we [classify biomes or climate types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome), you'll see that the classification of something as a desert is primarily dictated by precipitation, where some classifications parse out further classifications by temperature (e.g., cold desert vs subtropical desert) or other hydroclimatic factors (e.g., potential evapotranspiration, etc.). Thus, thinking about the borders of a desert, this will largely be determined by borders in the relevant variables, i.e., the ""edge"" of a desert would technically be wherever the mean annual precipitation (along with what other variables are being used depending on the classification system) no longer satisfies the definition of a desert. Whether the ""border"" of a given desert (say on a map) follows the precise hydroclimatic variables used to technically classify climate zones/types will depend on whether the extent of a given desert has more of a ""history"". More generally, the way many geographic things are classified and divided reflect a lot of historical precedent as opposed to hard and fast parameters."
AskScience,"We all know that if a massive asteroid struck earth it would be catastrophic for the species, but what if one hit the moon, or Mars? Could an impact there be so large that it would make earth less inhabitable?","If something was large enough to shift the moon out of its orbit or break it up, that could have consequences for all sorts of life on earth that rely on the moon for both tidal patterns and light etc.

AskScience,why does selective breeding speed up the evolutionary process so quickly in species like pugs but standard evolution takes hundreds of thousands if not millions of years to cause some major change?,"Because selective breeding can very strongly select for traits without consideration for survival fitness. In normal evolution, most random mutations will only be slightly (think 50.1% more likely to survive) advantageous, so it takes a long time for those things to be clearly better and warp the whole population to express them. However, selective breeding can make sure that a certain trait is 100% likely to be expressed in the future generation and undesirable traits are 0% likely to be expressed."
AskScience,"If things like misuse of antibiotics or overuse of hand sanitizers produces resistant strains of bacteria, can mouthwash do the same?","Alcohol in mouth wash works differently to an antibiotic because it actually breaks down the lipid layer of the cell membrane and when the alcohol gets inside the cell it breaks it down and it dies.  However nobody knows if or when an alcohol resistant bacteria will develop let’s hope it’s a long way away.

The thing to remember is if we we use a single method of action to kill anything that has  a fast reproductive rate the risk that a  mutated “bacteria” will be created will always exist but it is more than a single mutation that would be required for that to happen.

However recent studies have highlighted certain bacteria are already developing alcohol resistance in hospitals.   139 samples of E. faecium, isolated from 1997–2015 we’re assessed to see how well each sample tolerated diluted isopropyl alcohol.  After analysis, it became clear that the samples taken after 2009 were significantly more tolerant of alcohol than those taken before 2004.  So our reliance on “alcohol” as a sanitiser is already creating greater resistance in some bacteria in hospital settings and that could lead to an accidental creation of a totally totally resistant bacteria over time.  But these tests were with “diluted” not neat alcohol so while we may not need to panic now the potential does exist that bugs can learn to live in ever higher concentrations. 

Much work is being done on this problem but “cocktails” of substances so if one bacteria develops a resistance to one thing then something else in that cocktail will finish it off.  The next wave of “combined antibiotics” are already in development and the first have entered drug trials with good results.  So we may have new weapons in the fight against resistance in our arsenals soon."
AskScience,Why do modern day humans give birth lying down?,[removed]
AskScience,"Before Germ Theory, what did Medieval scientists make of fungal growth on rotting food?","They thought organic matter, in particular recently dead organic matter, was imbued with a residual life force. This life force could result in the Spontaneous Generation of new organisms from dead organic matter, not just fungi, but also flies and even mice.

This from Chymist, [Jan Baptist van Helmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont) in 1671:

>When water from the purest spring is placed in a flask steeped in leavening fumes, it putrefies, engendering maggots. The fumes which rise from the bottom of a swamp produce frogs, ants, leeches, and vegetation. . . Carve an indentation in a brick, fill it with crushed basil, and cover the brick with another, so that the indentation is completely sealed. Expose the two bricks to sunlight, and you will find that within a few days, fumes from the basil, acting as a leavening agent, will have transformed the vegetable matter into veritable scorpions . . . If a soiled shirt is placed in the opening of a vessel containing grains of wheat, the reaction of the leaven in the shirt with fumes from the wheat will, after approximately twenty-one days, transform the wheat into mice.

Philosophers and naturalists who believed in this idea were called Vitalists, as they believed in the theory of Vitalism. It was originally thought that this Life Force had a supernatural origin, imbued into life by Almighty God himself, but it was later imagined as some form of natural energy, unique to life, outwardly expressed as electricity or a magnetic fluid. 

This theory of Vitalism and Spontaneous Generation persisted far longer than it deserved, well into the 19th century, as some scientists believed that at least simple microscopic organisms (amoeba, fungi, bacteria) could spontaneously generate from dead organic matter, and this explained purification, fermentation, and parasitic diseases. 

Before its end, the theory of spontaneous generation received a major blow in the late 18th century, from the Italian scientist [Lazzaro Spallanzani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazzaro_Spallanzani), who conducted experiments with with heated Broths in sealed glass bottles. For a time the theory of spontaneous generation was in retreat but there was revived interest again, driven primarily by British scientist [John Needham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Needham) and French scientist [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon), who failed to properly repeat Spallanzani's experiment (they didn't heat the broth sufficiently, it wasn't sterile, it contained heat resistant bacterial [endospores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endospore)). 

However, Louis Pasteur finally disproved the last vestiges of spontaneous generation via a series of elegant experiments conducted in 1859 that in turn proved the germ theory of nature, using boiled ""fertile broth"" (*pasteurised* soup) inside glass bottles that were not air tight, but seperated from the outside air by a fluid or air lock valve (Swan Necked Flasks). 

https://medicalmuseum.org.uk/medical-science-pasteurs-swan-neck-flask

Pasteur showed that if the broth was sufficiently heated, killing all bacteria and heat resistant spores, the broth would not spoil. Only after opening the bottles, well to be precise, tilting the cleverly designed bottles so unheated liquid in the neck of the flask (visibly contaminated) entered the broth, the broth would then spoil. 

*Critically, because the Swan Neck Flasks weren't hermetically sealed, but allowed air in when the broth was boiled, this cleverly disproved stubborn critics who claimed that air itself contained the ""vital principle"" that caused spontaneous generation.*

Pasteur finally put an end to the theory of spontaneous generation and vitalistism. 

That said, it didn't go down without a fight. It was hard to convince some scientists, including the stubborn British again, especially because Pasteur had trouble repeating his experiments constantly.

Pasteur approached respected Irish scientist, [John Tyndall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall) for help. Tyndall consistently repeated Pasteur's experiment successfully in 1871, finally helping Pasteur prove his germ theory to the satisfaction of his most stubborn skeptics (Tyndall is also one of the early scientists that discovered that CO2 is a greenhouse gas).

Edit: I wonder if the theory of Vitalism influenced Mary Shelly and Frankenstein (The Modern Prometheus). I think Frankenstein is influenced by Vitalism, in particular Mesmerisim (a version of Vitalism). Luigi Galvani thought that electicity was the life force, based on his 1780 experiments with electricity and frogs legs, this theory of animal electricity was influenced by Franz Anton Mesmer who earlier develop his ideas of animal magnitism. 

However, I've never read anyone examine Shelly's novel from the perspective of Vitalism and Spontaneous Generation."
AskScience,"why do we only have LEDs around the visible light spectrum? Why not have MEDs (microwave-emitting) or REDs (radio), or even XED (x-ray) or GED (gamma)?","The energy transitions required to generate very high (x ray) and very low (radio wave) energy photons don't translate to the electronic transitions that LEDs use. To get into the (edit: midwave and beyond) infrared we have to play a lot of tricks with quantum wells (quantum cascades) to get sufficiently low energy photons. For higher energy transitions, this requires wider and wider band gap materials to get shorter and shorter wavelengths. This doesn't scale beyond the deep UV.

Edit: there seems to be some confusion by my use of ""infrared"" above. The first LEDs emitted light in what's known as the ""near infrared"", with a wavelength of around 900nm. These are even simpler than visible LEDs, which is why they were the first. Longer wavelength (like midwave (3-5 micron) or longer) infrared LEDs are where things like multi-quantum well structures are required."

AskScience,"Could humans ""breed"" a Neanderthal back into existence?","
Probably not.  As of 2017, the estimate was that about 20% of the Neanderthal genome is still extant, spread among modern humans.  

>In the Science study, Akey and Benjamin Vernot, both of the University of Washington in Seattle, used similar statistical features to search for Neanderthal DNA in the genomes of 665 living people—but they initially did so without the Neanderthal genome as a reference. They still managed to identify fragments that collectively amount to 20 percent of the full Neanderthal genome.

--[Surprise! 20 Percent of Neanderthal Genome Lives On in Modern Humans, Scientists Find](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140129-neanderthal-genes-genetics-migration-africa-eurasian-science/)

That's probably a floor rather than a ceiling, but even if they missed a lot it's hard to imagine more than 50% of the Neanderthal genome still being around.

In particular, it seems pretty likely that male human/Neanderthal hybrids were sterile (as often happens with interspecies hybrids), so there's a significant chunk of genome, the Y chromosome, missing altogether. 

>Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes. These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background.

--[The landscape of Neandertal ancestry in present-day humans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4072735/)

>Finally, the reduction of both archaic ancestries is especially pronounced on chromosome X and near genes more highly expressed in testes than other tissues (p = 1.2 × 10(-7) to 3.2 × 10(-7) for Denisovan and 2.2 × 10(-3) to 2.9 × 10(-3) for Neanderthal ancestry even after controlling for differences in level of selective constraint across gene classes). This suggests that reduced male fertility may be a general feature of mixtures of human populations diverged by >500,000 years.

AskScience,Is it possible for a planet to have a mountain that pierces its atmosphere?,"That kinda depends on what you consider to be the dividing line between the atmosphere and space. E.g. for Earth in most cases this division is considered to happen at the Karman line, where the atmosphere becomes too thin to provide enough aerodynamic forces to support an airplane and any flying mechanism would need to switch to jet force. It's happening at \~100 km, and no mountain on Earth would be able to reach this height.

However, we can imagine a planet where the atmosphere is much thinner. It could be even Earth, millions of years from now when the atmosphere will evaporate. The thickness of the atmosphere depends on many factors, such as its surface gravity, closeness to the central star  (whose star wind plays the major role in atmosphere evaporation), chemical content of the atmosphere, etc. So yes, with the right conditions, a mountain can pierce the planet's atmosphere."
AskScience,Is it possible for so much land to erode away that the earth will only be left with oceans?,"As long as we have plate tectonics, new mountains forming, then we'll always have some land surface, even under the assumption that the ocean level will stay roughly the same (200m is a reasonable buffer).

Once plate tectonics stop, only then will your argument be reasonable, but then it's over a long enough term that the idea of ocean level staying the same will likely fail (in 1-1.5 bln years oceans will fully evaporate from the increased Sun output -- could be slightly later than that but it will happen at some point).

So while in the end much of today's land could well erode away into an ocean, there's always new land from new mountains."

At least in some places. Studies from several western countries have demonstrated the ""reverse Flynn effect"" which has begun sometime in the 1990s. More recently, it was also confirmed that the cause seems to be primarily [environmental factors](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718793115) instead of migration or other social changes, which were brought up as possible explanation. However, it is still not clear what exactly those factors really are. What *is* clear however, is that while basic nutrition and formal education have certainly plateaued in western society, pollution is actually on the rise. It's not as bad as it was with leaded gasoline in the 70s, but low air quality definitely impacts the brain (and every other organ) negatively, even at limits that were officially deemed safe.

AskScience,"Why did the Chicxulub asteroid, the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, cause such wide-scale catastrophe and extinction for life on earth when there have been hundreds, if not hundreds of other similarly-sized or larger impacts that haven’t had that scale of destruction?","To start with, yes, Chicxulub sized impactors are common enough (on a geologic time scale) that we generally need to start looking for what made the Chicxulub impact special. Specifically, on average, Chicxulub sized impactors would be expected to hit Earth every 30-100 Myrs - with the 30 Myr recurrence end of the range probably more likely than the 100 Myr recurrence (e.g., [Grieve & Shoemaker, 1994](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xXWZolI9NkUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA417&ots=13R_A4bG_p&sig=UEFLjK_DgT1tS27BmgV7k12sAtk#v=onepage&q&f=false)), but there are not mass extinctions on the scale of the K-Pg with the same average rate of occurrence. The ""specialness"" of Chicxulub could be one of two things (or some combination of both):

1. **Location:** As discussed by [Kaiho & Oshima, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x), there's a broad idea that much of the ecological devastation caused by the Chicxulub impact came down to the rocks it hit, specifically a sulfur rich carbonate platform. At the time of impact, only ~13% of the Earth's surface contained similar rocks, so it's possible there would not have been an extinction if the Chicxulub impactor had hit any of the other 87% of the Earth surface. This also means that when considering the probability of an impact causing an extinction, we need to factor not just recurrence of a given sized impact, but also recurrence of a given sized impact hitting the right type of rocks. The role of location of the impact is considered more fully in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/kpg_impact_location/).
2. **Coincidence with Flood Basalts:** There's generally a vigorous debate about whether the impact or Deccan Traps volcanism was more important in the K-Pg extinction. This is discussed in more detail in another one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/k_pg_extinction_cause/), but one things that comes out of this is that there's a long-standing idea (bolstered by recent results) that neither the Deccan Traps or the Chicxulub impact were sufficient on their own to cause the extinction, but together, they could (e.g., [Petersen et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12079)). Thus, again, considering the probability, we have to think not just about the recurrence interval of a Chicxulub sized impactor, but the probability of a Chicxulub sized impactor hitting while a flood basalt is erupting (e.g., [White & Saunders, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002449370400310X)).

If we take both arguments at face value, we can start to see that even with a Chicxulub sized impact every 30 million years, in order for such an impact to actually cause a mass extinction it needs to potentially hit the right spot on Earth *and* at the same time as other climatic disruptions, like the eruptions of large igneous provinces. The probabilities (and thus expected average recurrence) of all of those together are significantly lower (i.e., longer average recurrence) than just the probability of a Chicxulub sized impactor hitting Earth."
AskScience,What does a muscle knot look like?,"They are formally referred to as [myofascial trigger points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_trigger_point). The scientific evidence surrounding them is messy and controversial. It's generally accepted that a trigger point is simply a small area of contracted muscle, like a small cramp or spasm. There's also an hypothesis that sometimes a knot/trigger point might not feel hard or tight to the touch when palpating, and is instead a phenomenon related to sensory disturbance.

So to answer the question, it would probably just look like regular muscle, perhaps contracted."
AskScience,"When archeologists find new structures in old megaliths, it's often presented as a secret chamber or some fanciful new feature.

Archaeologists don't want to find treasures, they want to find insight in civilisations long gone. There is a lot of information about Egypt, because they wrote down a lot, but there is a lot to discover. And as long as there are still people around claiming pyramids were constructed by an Alien invasion, it's crucial to examine every bit of new information, especially if it can provide answers.

""How did it work"" and ""why was it done"" are the two most important questions for archaeologists. And garbage can provide a lot of information on nutrition, trade, crafting (local and abroad) and manners. Egypt is even more special because the climate helps preserve stuff that is simply gone in other regions."

But, those same nutrients that are beneficial in smaller doses can be harmful in larger doses (which is why taking vitamin supplements is recommended against unless you have a particular deficiency). 

Probably, one dog peeing on a tree isn't going to hurt it much at all, let alone killing it. However, your neighbor also isn't wrong to request dogs pee elsewhere, since *enough* dogs all going in one spot will definitely kill the grass and possibly hurt the trees."

AskScience,Why can really bad odors induce vomit?,"So your brain is quietly monitoring your body and the environment around you for biological threats. By this I mean a bacterial or viral infection, ingesting something toxic etc. Sometimes the brain senses some putrid odors and interprets that as being near or ingesting something that obviously should not be eaten. This is a dangerous threat to the body, so the brain decides if you are going to barf, not your stomach. Now the brain has received sensory input of say a rotting animal with really strong odor and may decide there was a risk of ingestion of a pathogen. Barfing is one of its tools (along with diarrhea) to get bad things out of the body before they do harm. That rotting smell is a distinctive odor that is associated with decay bacteria that should not be ingested. The nose is sending a strong signal so the brain decides there might have been a risk of ingestion so we need to barf to get it out. A similar sort of effect can occur where people vomit seeing something gruesome like a mutilated dead body or animal (before decomposition). The brain interprets this visual cue as something bad is here, perhaps a toxin or whatever and sends the barf signal to be safe."
AskScience,Can spiders take over other spiders webs?,"Its not impossible, although keep in mind that many spiders actually redo the web daily to fix damages, and potentially to regain some lost effort by eating it.

However, especially with burrowing/tunneling spiders, they could occupy the den of a different spider or even non spider species."

AskScience,How does water evaporate if it never reaches boiling point?,"The temperature of an object (or in this case, a liquid) is based on the average energy of the particles in the object (and in the case of fluids, that energy is mostly based on speed). However, there is a wide distribution of energies particle to particle. The distribution of particle velocity is described by the [Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution). 

So, at any temperature, there will be some particles moving fast enough to evaporate, and the hotter you are, the more particles are above that limit (that's why you see a hot cup of water steam, but a cold cup of water you don't see that steam, even though both are below boiling, the higher temperature water will have more particles moving fast enough)."

AskScience,How does ultraviolet light harden/dry gel nail polish?,"When the gel is put on your nail, it contains two ingredients:

- Monomers, which are fairly short molecules that can link together to form longer molecules which we call polymers. That's great, because a polymer is what we want in the end, but monomers won't spontaneously link up, they need a little boost;

- Another molecule called the ""radical initiator"", generally a peroxide.

**EDIT**: *while the process I describe below exists and is used in various applications, it seems that nail polish specifically uses chemicals that are not peroxides, such as TPO (trimethylbenzoylphosphine oxide) or camphorquinone. Although they do not have a peroxide bond, they follow the same idea: the energy supplied by the UV light breaks the existing molecule into radicals, which then trigger polymerization of the gel. In the case of camphorquinone, it is also combined with another chemical - an amine - that facilitates this initiation process.*

A peroxide is any molecule that has an O-O single bond, i.e. two oxygen atoms who share a pair of electrons among themselves. Now, oxygen, as an atom, loves to connect with other atoms, and given the chance two oxygen atoms will link with a *double* bond (two pairs of electrons), which is very stable. But in peroxides, they're also bonding with other atoms so they can only have a single bond (one pair of electrons), and that's much weaker. It's strong enough for the peroxide to hold together, but it doesn't take much energy to break that bond and ""cut"" the peroxide in two.

Well, turns out UV light packs a fair amount of energy - enough to give you a sunburn for instance. So here's what happens:

- The UV light shines on the gel. The monomers don't really care, but that energy input breaks the O-O bond in the peroxide;

- The resulting ""half-molecules"" are called radicals (one peroxide -> two radicals), and they both have this dangling oxygen that wants nothing more than to connect with other atoms;

- Each radical will latch onto a monomer, which is energetically preferable but the resulting radical+monomer will have an unpaired electron, which means it will be able to link with another monomer, but that monomer will also end up with an electron imbalance, so it latches onto another monomer, etc, etc. In a few seconds/minutes, hundreds/thousands of short monomer chains link together in an attempt to balance out their electronic configuration;

- Finally, the long chains (they are now polymers) will run into each other and various processes will allow the electronic configurations to stabilize (covalent bonds between chains, transfer of hydrogen atoms).

And now you have one massive structure of linked chains, which have completely different mechanical properties: instead of a gel it's now a solid surface, essentially a plastic. Ta-da!"

AskScience,Why do hearts have FOUR chambers not two?,"The reason is that [a four-chambered heart allows continuous inflow, while also allowing intermittent high-pressure pumped outflow.](http://cardiac-output.info/1967AHJ.pdf)

If you only had a two-chambered heart, every time a chamber pumped, you would need to seal off the inlet to that chamber (otherwise, the chamber would pump blood in both directions, forward and backward at the same time!) This would mean, for example, sealing off the vena cava for every single heartbeat, which would cause blood in the vena cava to stop moving completely (and back up) with every single heartbeat, which would be terribly inefficient.

So you introduce two ""waiting rooms"" for the pumping chambers, the atria. Blood can continuously flow into them, but the opening between them and the ventricle can be sealed for every ventricle-pump. So you have continuous inflow of blood, which can collect until the ventricle is ready to receive it...then the collected blood can be quickly (but more gently) pumped into the waiting ventricle, which can then forcefully pump that blood forward *while more blood collects in the atrium behind it*. Blood keeps moving, the ventricle spends less down-time waiting to fill with blood, and everybody wins!

AskScience,How does water reach every house in a city in roughly the same conditions? shouldnt a house interrupt the system?,"Pressure is largely static because the discrepancy between the volume of the source versus the volume of the house supply.  1,000,000:1.

AskScience,What is physically happening inside your sinuses when they crackle and open up from congestion?,"There are structures known as turbinates within the nose. Their purpose is to increase the surface area of olfactory cells and to induce turbulence in the air flow to improve air-olfactory contact. They are not boneless, but mobile, essentially like flappy meat curtains hanging inside your nasal cavity. These can become inflamed when experiencing illness or allergies, and they are also capable of moving side to side a bit. The sensation you feel is when a turbinate moves to unblock the nasal passage on one side. This is why laying down on your side often opens up the nostril that’s on top with respect to gravity. The clicking may be the sound of the turbinate disadhering from the sticky nasal cavity wall, but I’m not 100% certain on that.

AskScience,Does the cerebral spinal fluid of people with Alzheimer's have a notably different pH from 'normal' people's?,"I can weigh in since I'm in the field. You don't generally see pH differences in the cerebral spinal fluid, our body does a pretty good job at regulating it. You DO see differences in pH in the cell, i.e. lysosome is about pH 4.6 and cytosol is about pH 7.2. Tau and beta amyloid protein do experience a range of pH environments. One of the hypothesis for the spread of tau is through the process of endocytosis, wherein a neuron that contains tau tangles may die and release the tau, then an adjacent neuron creates a pouch that internalizes outside contents (including tau proteins). This pouch becomes an endosome which becomes acidic in nature.

On the topic of the causation or symptom, it is unclear, but we do know there is a positive feedback loop. In clinic trials, we've gone after Abeta plaques, but these drugs show limited efficacy (Aducanumab is an FDA approved antibody that clears Abeta plaques, but again limited efficacy).

AskScience,"Can a photon, from a source other than the sun, pass through the sun completely? In summary, does the sphere of the sun cast a shadow if there were a much brighter light source on the other side of it?","The sun is not transparent. The visible surface of the sun would be the same even if you disregarded all the emitted light and only considered how much it obscures background objects. Looking at the limb of the sun it can be seen that the sun's surface turns from fully transparent to fully opaque over a distance of maybe hundreds of km as the density of the solar plasma increases the deeper you go. The measure of how translucent something is, ie. how much stuff is needed between you and an object to obscure the latter, is called [optical depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth_(astrophysics\)) or optical thickness.

Plasma is particularly good at being opaque, as being an ionized gas, all the free electrons in it are very happy to absorb and scatter light as it goes through, much moreso than the same amount of neutral gas would.

The fact that stars are, indeed, opaque, can be exploited to find binary stars, particularly dimmer companions in close orbits around a brighter, more massive star. If the pair orbits edge-on from our perspective, such that the components [transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit) each other, each transit causes a tiny dip in the binary's total brightness because some of either star's light is blocked by its companion."
AskScience,"If proteins are needed to create more proteins, then how were the first proteins created ?","We’re not sure *exactly* how the initial building blocks of life came to be something that is alive. It’s possible the earliest building blocks compiled by chance due to naturally occurring chemical reactions near the underwater hydrothermal vents on the sea floor billions of years ago. The results of those reactions were mixed in the water through random chance, and eventually something self-replicating was created. Maybe multiple times. Maybe multiple variations. We don’t even know how likely it is for this to happen. We have never created life purely from raw components despite trying (we have created what I would call “mutant” synthetic cellular life, but it is built from already living organisms). This theory is part of the reason why the ocean moons in the solar system are so interesting, because the same conditions may exist on those moons that existed on the sea floor when life started on Earth. If it’s a relatively “easy” series of accidents that lead to life there could be simple life in multiple places within our own solar system. And if that’s the case it dramatically increases the odds that some of the billions of planets within our galaxy are also harboring life."
AskScience,Are there at least *some* dinosaurs in fossil fuel?,"This can quickly get into a discussion of the chemical arguments for plant-origin of most petroleum products (plants and animals have different chemical and isotopic signatures so materials derived from the decay of plant mass differs from that derived from animal mass).  Chemistry tells us that most of the material has a plant origin.  It is a complicated discussion though, because petroleum isn't unchanged from its original materials so the proof is indirect and largely a ""wealth of evidence"" argument.

Then there is the simple consideration that the vast bulk of global biomass exists in plants and bacteria.  Animals are a tiny proportion of the earth's biomass (like 1% range), and presumably has been that way or smaller through time.

But I think the simplest answer is to say that there is very likely some animal material in petroleum/natural gas just like there is likely some oxygen in your recent breath that was also breathed by Julius Caesar.  The amount is small.  The proportion of animal derived chemicals in petroleum is low relative to the proportion of plant-derived chemicals.

Also, I am pretty sure that PNG is not largely phytoplankton, although that, as with many things geology, is open to discussion.  The main oil fields are located in regions of shallow seas where there was a high input of terrestrial materials, so a lot of the organic matter is eroded land plant residuals. That ain't phytoplankton in the oilfields of the Mississippi delta, for example."
AskScience,How do mosquitoes find water to reproduce?,"Mosquitoes like many insects have incredibly sensitive sense organs in the form of antennae. These are able to detect a whole range of molecules including water. It's similar to us being able to smell but way way more sensitive. 

Many mosquito species (such as aedes aegypti) will lay eggs in containers just above the water line, so when it rains these eggs get wet and hatch. Other species will lay eggs in mud and only after a number of rewettings will they hatch.  This is why you get a massive increase in the population very quickly."
AskScience,"As an astronaut travels to space, what does it feel like to become weightless? Do you suddenly begin floating after reaching a certain altitude? Or do you slowly become lighter and lighter during the whole trip?","To answer the question directly, they become weightless from the moment main engine cutoff occurs about 8 minutes or so after lift-off.

The reason they become weightless isn't because there is no gravity in orbit. In fact, it's gravity that's keeping them in orbit in the first place. The reason they become weightless is that they're in free-fall.

That moment where your stomach turns on a roller coaster is the same effect - briefly - you're able to match the acceleration due to gravity and feel no weight. There is a specialist aircraft called the ""[Vomit Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced-gravity_aircraft)"" used to train astronauts that creates long periods of freefall in a purpose built aircraft.

Spacecraft are moving sideways so fast that despite them falling towards the Earth, they continue to miss it. This occurs at around 7.5 kilometres per second or about 5 miles a second in the old money. 

On re-entry things are a bit more interesting.

Gravity slowly climbs as the pressure of the air against the returning vehicle counters the acceleration due to gravity. With space capsules there are period of intense G as the airpressure outside dramatically slows the capsule. With the Spaceshuttle, it's quite a gentle affair as 1G returns on transition to gliding flight."

AskScience,How do gland problems stop people from losing weight?,"Yes.

So effectively in equation terms, yes, if you managed to burn 2400 calories and only ate 1900, you would lose weight; but easy burning is the pretty much the key glandular factor issue."
AskScience,"Why does hand foot and mouth disease (coxsackievirus) cause blisters in the hands, feet, and mouth?","In order for a virus to infect a cell, it has to be able to bind to one or more receptors on the cell's surface (often proteins on the cell's surface, but can be other things like specific lipids in the cell membrane, or carbohydrates on the membrane's surface) and use them as a foothold to somehow deliver its genetic information into the cell.  


If a cell doesn't have the right receptors on its surface, the virus can't grab on to them, and that affects which kinds of cells it can infect. For instance, HIV uses receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR4 to enter certain kinds of white blood cells - cells that don't have those receptors, (e.g. pretty much any other kind of cell in our bodies) can't be infected by HIV. Changes in the receptor's structures can also affect binding ability - for instance, you may have heard about people who are [naturally resistant to HIV because they have a mutation in CCR5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_resistance_to_HIV).  


It's also worth noting that successful infection often requires successful interactions with multiple different kinds of receptors and not just a single one - so if a cell doesn't have the right mix of other receptors on its surface, it may not get infected even if it also has what researchers have determined to be the ""primary"" receptor.  


Presumably, the epithelial cells in the hands, feet, and mouth just happen to have the right mix of receptors that enable infection by coxsackievirus A16 (or enterovirus 71, the other main virus that can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease). [This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347270/) says a protein called SCARB2 is a receptor used by both coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71, and [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5567171/) indicates that certain carbohydrates on the cell membrane are also necessary for infection by coxsackievirus A16."

6.1.c- receive training and have expertise in gender identity development, gender diversity in children and adolescents, have
the ability to assess capacity to assent/consent, and possess general knowledge of gender diversity across the life span.     
6.1.d- receive training and develop expertise in autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental presentations or
collaborate with a developmental disability expert when working with autistic/neurodivergent gender diverse adolescents.     
6.1.e- Continue engaging in professional development in all areas relevant to gender diverse children, adolescents, and families.     
6.2- We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents facilitate the exploration and expression
of gender openly and respectfully so that no one particular identity is favored.     
6.3- We recommend health care professionals working with gender diverse adolescents undertake a comprehensive biopsychosocial
assessment of adolescents who present with gender identity-related concerns and seek medical/surgical transition-related care,
and that this be accomplished in a collaborative and supportive manner.     
6.4- We recommend health care professionals work with families, schools, and other relevant settings to promote acceptance of
gender diverse expressions of behavior and identities of the adolescent.     
6.5- We recommend against offering reparative and conversion therapy aimed at trying to change a person’s gender and lived
gender expression to become more congruent with the sex assigned at birth.     
6.6- We suggest health care professionals provide transgender and gender diverse adolescents with health education on chest
binding and genital tucking, including a review of the benefits and risks.     
6.7- We recommend providers consider prescribing menstrual suppression agents for adolescents experiencing gender incongruence
who may not desire testosterone therapy, who desire but have not yet begun testosterone therapy, or in conjunction with
testosterone therapy for breakthrough bleeding.     
6.8- We recommend health care professionals maintain an ongoing relationship with the gender diverse and transgender adolescent
and any relevant caregivers to support the adolescent in their decision-making throughout the duration of puberty suppression
treatment, hormonal treatment, and gender- related surgery until the transition is made to adult care.     
6.9- We recommend health care professionals involve relevant disciplines, including mental health and medical professionals, to
reach a decision about whether puberty suppression, hormone initiation, or gender-related surgery for gender diverse and
transgender adolescents are appropriate and remain indicated throughout the course of treatment until the transition is made
to adult care.     
6.10- We recommend health care professionals working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents requesting gender-affirming
medical or surgical treatments inform them, prior to initiating treatment, of the reproductive effects including the potential loss
of fertility and available options to preserve fertility within the context of the youth's stage of pubertal development.     
6.11- We recommend when gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments are indicated for adolescents, health care professionals
working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents involve parent(s)/guardian(s) in the assessment and treatment process,
unless their involvement is determined to be harmful to the adolescent or not feasible.
The following recommendations are made regarding the requirements for gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment (All of them
must be met):     
6.12- We recommend health care professionals assessing transgender and gender diverse adolescents only recommend
gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments requested by the patient when:     
6.12.a- the adolescent meets the diagnostic criteria of gender incongruence as per the ICd-11 in situations where a diagnosis
is necessary to access health care. In countries that have not implemented the latest ICd, other taxonomies may be used although
efforts should be undertaken to utilize the latest ICd as soon as practicable.     
6.12.b- the experience of gender diversity/incongruence is marked and sustained over time.     
6.12.c- the adolescent demonstrates the emotional and cognitive maturity required to provide informed consent/assent for the treatment.     
6.12.d- the adolescent’s mental health concerns (if any) that may interfere with diagnostic clarity, capacity to consent, and
gender-affirming medical treatments have been addressed.     
6.12.e- the adolescent has been informed of the reproductive effects, including the potential loss of fertility and the available
options to preserve fertility, and these have been discussed in the context of the adolescent’s stage of pubertal development.     
6.12.f- the adolescent has reached tanner stage 2 of puberty for pubertal suppression to be initiated.     
6.12.g- the adolescent had at least 12 months of gender-affirming hormone therapy or longer, if required, to achieve the desired
surgical result for gender-affirming procedures, including breast augmentation, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, hysterectomy, phalloplasty,
metoidioplasty, and facial surgery as part of gender-affirming treatment unless hormone therapy is either not desired or is
medically contraindicated"
AskScience,"Is there any possible relation between the recent earthquakes in Turkey/Syria, Japan and Papua New Guinea?","A form of this question is asked after virtually every large earthquake that makes the news, so I'm going to keep my answer generic with the futile hope that I can put this in our FAQs and *maybe* retire this question. To first cover the underlying geology and earthquake behavior, there are specific processes by which one earthquake can trigger others. This is discussed in more detail in one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_trigger/), but in short we can consider either **static** or **dynamic** triggering. **Static** triggering is where the permanent movement of the crust that results from a particular earthquake changes the stress state on neighboring faults pushing some of them closer (or past) failure through [stress transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_stress_transfer). Static triggering occurs over a very limited distance (roughly X km away from anywhere along the portion of the fault that ruptures where X is the total length of the original rupture). **Dynamic** triggering is where passing seismic waves, and the temporary change in stress they induce, causes a portion of a fault to fail. Dynamic triggering can occur over long (i.e., *teleseismic*) distances, but it tends to mostly be associated with *very* large magnitude earthquakes as the generative event, is pretty rare, is temporally limited (i.e., we only consider dynamic triggering to be possible over a narrow time window after the original event), and is hard to demonstrate. **Given the above, when this question gets asked, i.e., ""There was a big earthquake in location X and then there were moderate magnitude earthquakes in distant locations in the days, weeks, or months following, are they related?"" there is a *vanishingly small* probability that one or more of those events may be a dynamically triggered event, but the overwhelmingly vast majority of the time, the answer is firmly and unequivocally, ""No, they are not related"".**

So what's going on and why is this question asked so often? Mostly cognitive biases. Specifically, some mixture of the [frequency illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion) and the [clustering illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion). The frequency illusion (or Baader–Meinhof phenomenon) is basically the tendency for your brain to take note of similar events after you become aware of an event. So, a large magnitude earthquake hits a populated area and makes the news and for some period after that you (and the news media more broadly) take note of other even moderate magnitude events. This also brings in the second bias, i.e., the clustering illusion, or the tendency for us to see patterns in stochastic (random) things. Within this context, it's worth considering just how many earthquakes of a given magnitude there are, e.g., [the global statistics from the USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/lists-maps-and-statistics). You'll notice a rough logarithmic behavior in these, i.e., for M8+ we expect about 1 a year, for M7-7.9 ~15/year, for M6-6.9 ~150/year, for M5-5.9 ~1500/year, and so on. So in a scenario where one of the ~15 7-7.9 events happens in a populated place and you notice a tiny fraction of the hundreds to thousands of 6-6.9 or 5-5.9 magnitude events we expect *every year* that also occur in a different populated place (i.e., excluding aftershocks from the original event) in the following days/weeks, does that mean anything or imply any linkage? No, almost always, it represents nothing other than you paying attention to a small fraction of events because you are primed to and seeing patterns that aren't there."
AskScience,Why is radioactive decay exponential?,"Exponential decay comes from the following fact:

The rate of decay is directly proportional to how many undecayed nuclei there are at that moment.

This describes a differential equation whose solution is an exponential function.

Now, why is that fact true? Ultimately, it comes down to two facts about individual radioactive nuclei:

\- Their decay is not affected by surrounding nuclei (in other words, decays are independent events), and

\- The decay of any individual nucleus is a random event whose probability is not dependent on time.

These two facts combined mean that decay rate is proportional to number of nuclei."
AskScience,Do all babies make the same babbling noises before they learn to speak or does babbling change with the languages the babies are exposed to?,"I believe that the babbling varies depending on the prosody of the language, that is whether it's stress timed (like English) or syllable timed (like French) or mora timed (like Japanese). These timings tend to be exaggerated when we use 'baby talk' (Gleason, Jean Berko., and Nan Bernstein Ratner. ""The Development of Language"", 8th ed. Pearson, 2013. Got this from Wikipedia.)

I don't know if it has anything to do with a languages phonemic inventory though"

This is a really cool graphic about hematopoiesis (production of blood cells and platelets) in different bones over the lifespan

Edited to include source: originally from Rodak’s Hematology: clinical principles and applications (textbook) though this was presented to me in a failure in physiology class in undergrad.

AskScience,"When prehistoric land masses are depicted, what is the accuracy to which they are drawn. Would the maps produced be useful for navigating that world?","Broadly speaking, the accuracy will decrease the further back in time you consider. This is primarily because the completeness of the geologic record as preserved in rocks decreases as a function of age (though not necessarily linearly), but also because uncertainties and/or errors related to various assumptions that are made to construct paleogeographic maps also increase as a function of age. Thus, the level of accuracy is pretty different for a paleogeographic map of the last glacial maximum (~24,000 years ago) compared to the early Cambrian (~530,000,000 years ago) and so on, but not necessarily easily quantifiable.

Within a given map, there will also likely be portions that are much more certain than others. It's worth considering the primary datasets we use to construct paleogeographic maps and what each dataset provides in terms of information. The base for virtually all paleogeographic maps are plate tectonic reconstructions, i.e., at a given time, where individual tectonic plates were, what shape they approximately were, where were their continental and oceanic components were, and what rate and direction they were moving. A variety of data informs these reconstructions, including paleomagnetism (which allows us to reconstruct paleolatitude for locations at a given time), a variety of geophysical data (it's increasingly common to use seismic tomography to reconstruct subducted slabs and ""undo"" subduction to aid in reconstructing ocean basins), and other geodetic data for more recent reconstructions (for recent reconstructions, the current long-term average plate rates can be extrapolated backwards reliably for 10s of million years). In addition to tectonic reconstructions, the type rocks of a given age in a location can also provide context, e.g., rocks that are diagnostic of near shore depositional environments provide context that at the time those rocks were deposited, the coastline was near that location, etc. What this means is that for most paleogeographic maps (at least within the Phanerozoic, and into portions of the Proterozoic) the broad locations of continents and their first order shapes will be broadly correct and probably in roughly the right location (in the sense of latitude and longitude). In certain places on these continents, there might be higher levels of certainty of the location of the coasts and things like major rivers based on the rocks that are preserved. Similarly, large mountain chains will be approximately in the right place, but many of the details of them (e.g., their exact widths, heights, etc) will be only relatively constrained. Lots of fine scale details would not be preserved, some of which might certainly impact the utility of maps for navigation, so things like smaller rivers (and even some large rivers) and small to moderate sized islands (so things the size of Hawaii, etc) would generally not be preserved so a paleogeographic map would not include it, and again, more so the further back you go.

Finally, when considering paleogeographic maps, it's also important to realize that there is a fair amount of artistic license taken in many cases. A good paleogeographic map will use as much of the available data to constrain as much of the paleogeography as possible, but there will still be *a lot* of unknowns so choices have to be made. Different people making paleogeographic maps take different strategies for how to make some of these choices. You can compare some commonly used sets of global reconstructions, e.g., those from [Christopher Scotese](http://scotese.com/earth.htm) and those from [Ron Blakey](https://deeptimemaps.com/), to get a sense of the variability. Without a doubt, Blakey's maps are much more aesthetically pleasing and he does a huge amount of work to make sure they're as accurate as they can be, but he also takes a lot more license to make things always look complete and like ""real"" landscapes (even when that completeness is effectively made up). In comparison, if you look at especially old time slices in Scotese's maps, they look more like blobs on the globe, which is not as pretty, but more accurate in terms of the level of certainty we have with respect to the actual paleogeography. 

**In short,** the level of accuracy will broadly scale with how far back in time the period that is being reconstructed, with paleogeographic maps reconstructing periods further back in time being less accurate than more recent times. Within a time slice, some features will be much more certain than others where as some features will be effectively made up depending on the available data for that time period (and the preceding and following time periods). All of this means that we can't really quantify the accuracy of these maps (and we can't ground truth them either), but depending on the level of ""navigation"" you had in mind and the time period in question, they could be used to navigate to some degree. Broadly, if you trying to get from one major landmass to another by boat, most all of them would probably be good enough (at least within the last few hundred million years). If you were trying to navigate over land, there would probably be a lot of fine scale details that you would have no idea existed based on the map. Further back in time, even navigation by sea would become a bit more tricky as the probability of a semi-large island chain being in your way (that's not on the map, because it was not preserved in the geologic record) goes up."
AskScience,Why is it that physical exercise is inflammatory in the short term but has a net anti inflammatory effect in the long term?,"Our body has mechanisms to not only induce and amplify inflammatory responses when necessary but also to turn off the response when is no longer required. The inflammation that happen because of physical exercise is a different type of stimulus than an inflammatory response to a pathogen or tissue damage. Just as an example interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a common pro-inflammatory cytokines. After infections IL-6 is produced by activation of the transcription factor NF-kB which at the same time induces the expression of a number of other inflammatory mediators. Exercise induces IL-6 with a mechanism involving activation of the c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK). The release of IL-6 after exercise also results in the production of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonists which are anti-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol which also reduces the inflammatory response ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0177-9#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20may%20thus%20be,%2Dmorbidity%2C%20of%20old%20age.))
The reason why the same cytokine exerts these very different effects as far as I know is still not completely clear. It is likely due to the specific type of inflammatory mediators that are produced along with IL-6 and also it probably depends on the duration of the stimulus since it's known that even the same inflammatory cue can have different results in an acute or in a chronic setting."
AskScience,How does a caterpillar turn into a butterfly at a cellular level? What happens to trigger the various stages? Are their factors that would prevent it or delay it? Or is it inevitable in this species? What causes the cellular change? Is there anything remotely similar in certain human cells?,"This is a really huge and very interesting topic in embryology and it's very similar to what happens in humans and other vertebrates that turns them from a ball of undifferentiated cells into a human (or a dog, or a gorilla, or a cobra, or a frog, or...).

There's so much going on here that entire textbooks are written about it. But in a very clumsy attempt to summarise it into reddit post length: cells start sending out different chemical messages based on external factors. An important one is spatial orientation with respect to gravity. Cells closer to the gravitational centre will start producing chemical signals that are different from the cells furthest from the gravitational centre. These chemicals diffuse through the developing organism and cells start to receive different messages about how they should express their genes based on a ""concentration gradient"". Put simply, the cells closer to the source of the signalling molecules will receive a larger dose than those further away and the genes they express become differentiated based on this difference in concentration of ""dose"". Once this initial differentiation is achieved, increasingly complex signals are sent to neighbouring cells based on prior differentiation. It's very complicated but you could read up on something called the ""French Flag Model"" in embryology to get a beginners grasp of what is going on."
AskScience,"Why are there so many pre-modern human fossils from the past several million years, but very few pre-modern chimp or gorilla ones?","Edit: I misunderstood the question. One speculation for the decreased number of chimp fossils is the environment of jungle (chimp/gorilla) vs. savannah (human) being less conducive for fossilization.


~~The premise is incorrect.~~ We have fossil evidence for several prehistoric non-human apes and other primates They just don't get the notoriety as protohuman fossils.

Dryopithecus is a prehistoric ape, likely related to orangutans or African apes, although it could be related to humans, as it existed around the same time as gorillas split off.

Gigantopithecus was once thought to related to human, but is now thought to be related to orangutans.

Megaladapis is a prehistoric giant lemur (not an ape) but it died out in the past 10,000 years.

Archaeoindris is a gorilla sized lemur that went extinct around 2000 years ago.  There's a ton of prehistoric lemurs.

Afropithecus is another African ape predecessor.

Mesopithecus and Oreopithecus are European ape ancestors, although they probably died out, since there aren't modern European apes (besides humans).

Anything too old becomes hard to differentiate between protohuman and protoape. Chimps split off around 5 million years ago, and gorillas split off maybe 8 million years ago."
AskScience,"What type of hardware is used to render amazing CGI projects like Avatar: Way of the Water? Are these beefed up computers, or are they made special just for this line of work?","I have previously worked in video effects post-production but I have had no involvement in the production of either 'Avatar' movie and have not seen 'Avatar 2':

Fundamentally you could use any sort of commodity computer to render these effects, but the more powerful it is the quicker it can work. Even for the most powerful computers with the best graphics ability available you may still be looking at it taking many hours to render a single frame. If your movie is 24 frames a second and it takes, say 20 hours to render a frame, you can see that it soon becomes impractical to make and tweak a good visual storyline in a reasonable amount of time.

Enter the render farm: here you have a render farm and a job manager that can split the work out and send different parts of it to different computers. You might even split each single frame into different pieces for rendering on different computers. This way you can parallelize your work, so if you split your frame into 10 pieces, rather than it taking 20 hours to render it will take 2. 

Your job manager also needs to take account of what software, with what plugins, and what licences is available on each available node (computer in your render farm) and collating the output into a finished file.

If you have a lot of video effects in your movie, you are going to need a lot of computer time to render them, and for something that's almost entirely computer generated, you're going to need a massive amount of resources. Typically you will want to do this on a Linux farm if you can because it's so much simpler to manage at scale.

If you want to find out more about some of the software commonly used, you could look up:

- [nuke studio](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/nuke) -compositing and editing
- [Maya](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview) - 3d asset creator
- [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/) - procedural effects. Think smoke, clouds, water, hair...
- [Deadline](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline) - render farm/job manager

These are just examples, and there are alternatives to all of them but Maya and Houdini would commonly be run on both workstations and render nodes to do the same job"
AskScience,Why can an adult’s GI tract expel C. botulinum spores while an infant can’t?,"Your professor is wrong; it is nothing to do with expelling the spores. 

The botulinum bacteria is a poor competitor. In an environment where there are already lots of other established bacteria, it struggles to form toxin-producing colonies; babies have less developed gut flora, not just because they haven't picked them up from the environment but also because their diet is much more limited. 

Adults do occasionally get intestinal botulism. This usually happens in cases where they have been on antibiotics for some time and the gut flora has been killed off.

I really recommend the This Podcast Will Kill You episode on botulism!"
AskScience,What stops grains of salt with combining with eachother?,"Not enough energy. Imagine there were two big crowds of people, the people in each crowd are linking arms with each other. Now, combine them. 
That won't be easy. Who needs to unlock their arms to link up with the other crowd? How are you going to combine so that people don't get squished somewhere along the boundary? Lots of energy to expend rearranging people as necessary. If one crowd wasn't linked up (ie they're liquid) it would be much easier for people to walk up to the second crowd and find a good spot to link their arms (a nucleation site)."
AskScience,How did astronomers think the sun worked before the discovery of nuclear fusion?,"There were a few competing ideas but here is a summary of the ones I know of:

\- The sun was very hot due to some past event and was gradually cooling down i.e. it didn't have an internal energy source.

\- It was a material gradually collapsing under its own gravity. This gradual crushing was leading to heating of the inner material and this thermal energy was conducted away to the surface.

\- The sun's heat was a result of chemical reactions i.e. it's genuinely a ball of 'fire' .

\[EDIT - forgot this one\]  - Even before nuclear fusion was discovered there were other processes like atomic decay which were posited. Some nuclear isotopes are naturally warm to the touch because of the amount of heat they release.

\- Some combination of the above.

When you do the calculations for each of these, the problem you quickly come to is that the sun would run out energy relatively quickly i.e. hundreds of thousands, or millions of years versus billions. One must remember though that in Victorian era where people began to work out these above cases, nobody knew the age of the universe, solar system or even earth to any degree of precision.  


\[Edit\] I'd also like to add that the exact form that fusion takes (proton-proton chain vs CNO cycle) is still an area of research and depends on exactly which star and in what stage of its life it happens to be."
AskScience,How do white blood cells know in which direction there is a bacteria?,"At a very simple level, it's all concentration gradients. Kind of like a dog can sniff and follow a scent trail from a very faint signature, following the trail until it is eventually on top of the target. Immune cells like the one in the video (presumably a monocyte or macrophage) have receptors specifically designed for Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are molecules that are found on bacteria, fungi, viruses etc that our immune cells have evolved to recognize with receptors specific to them (antibodies not needed). An example of a PAMP is endotoxin/LPS that is a part of the bacterial cell wall. So for example, the bacteria sheds LPS or other pieces of its cell wall as it floats around, and the immune cell ""sniffs"" it out with its receptor and starts following the trail. 

It gets more complex. There are hierarchical signals for what determines which direction an immune cell will migrate. For example, if local tissue cells realize there is an active ongoing infection, they will secrete ""red flag"" signals to recruit nearby immune cells to the area. These signals are called chemokines. So the immune cell floating around your blood will first detect the chemokines and realize something is wrong, and will enter the area where they are coming from. From that point on, if it senses PAMPs (the bacterial molecules), it'll switch and start moving toward the bacteria."
AskScience,Can I apply pressure in a vacuum?,"Yes, the syringe will act as if there is nothing in it, because *there is nothing in it*. When you ""filled it with vacuum"" nothing went in. The only resistance you should feel is the friction between the plunger seal and the barrel."
AskScience,How fast does the Milky Way spin? How far does Earth move through space in a year?,"Most of the Milky Way galaxy, including the Sun, orbits at around 200-250 km/s; see e.g. figure 16 of [this review article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07702.pdf). Note that this implies the galaxy cannot be rotating rigidly. Objects closer to the center have shorter orbital periods.

That's about 1/1400 the speed of light, so the Sun and Earth cover about that fraction of a light year in one year, with respect to the galaxy.

Of course, all motion is relative. Why choose the Milky Way galaxy as a reference? Actually, there is a fairly natural ""rest frame"" for the local universe, and that's the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). An observer in that frame finds the CMB to be equally hot in every direction. We do not, so we infer that the Sun is moving at about 370 km/s (1/800 the speed of light) with respect to the CMB rest frame.

Interestingly, that motion is anti-aligned with our motion about the galaxy, which means the Milky Way itself is moving at about 550 km/s with respect to the CMB. See table 3 of [this article](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1993ApJ...419....1K) for more velocity comparisons; LSR is the local standard of rest, referring to the average motion of nearby stars; GC is the Milky Way galactic center; CMB is the cosmic microwave background; and LG is the local group containing the Milky Way, Andromeda, and many smaller galaxies."
AskScience,Does an X watt appliance also act as an X watt heater?,"Yes, assuming it's actually drawing X watts. All of the energy that comes out of the wall has to go somewhere, and heat is the overwhelming majority of it (you'll probably lose some tiny amount of it through light out of the window and such). 

> Does this mean running a PC in a thermostat heated room is essentially free, on account of the heat from the PC meaning the space heater has to run less?

Yes, *assuming that your heating is all electroresistive*. If you have gas heating, or a heat pump, then this will not be the case, because in the former case gas is cheaper per unit energy than electricity, and in the latter a heat pump can be considerably more than 100% efficient."
AskScience,Why are recently flipped iceburgs blue?,[removed]
AskScience,How certain are we that the universe began 13.77 billion years ago?,"Cosmologists are not at all sure that the age of the universe is 13.77 Billion years, and there is increasing evidence that it is not; that 13.1 Billion or younger better matches some observations. The proper-time age of the universe can be inferred from observations in many ways. Ideally these ways would all produce the same result. That's not currently the case for big-bang cosmology! This discrepancy is kind of a big deal and is known as *[The Hubble Tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law#Hubble_tension)*, and the *[Crisis in Cosmology](https://astromart.com/news/show/the-hubble-tension-is-real-and-has-now-surpassed-the-important-5-sigma-threshold)*

To determine the *Hubble Constant* (the physical constant that determines the proportionality relationship between speed and distance for all sufficiently distant astronomical bodies) we use 2 broad categories of methods: Early Universe and Late Universe methods. 

Early Universe methods depend heavily on [ΛCDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) or other models, plus observations of the [Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background).
Essentially deducing the Hubble Constant by the temperature of the CMB and how quickly one would expect it to cool using the ΛCDM model.

Late Universe methods use observed [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) (basically relative velocity) and various inferred distance measurements known as the [Cosmic Distance Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder).

Both of these methods should agree, and at first they did albeit with large error bars. However Over time, as more observations have been made with more sensitive instruments... [They](https://mappingignorance.org/app/uploads/2022/04/figure2.png) [diverged](https://mappingignorance.org/2022/04/04/the-hubble-tension-in-perspective-a-crisis-in-modern-cosmology/)! Now we have this inconsistency in our independent results, and therefore a serious inconsistency in our prediction of the proper-time age of the universe.

The options to resolve this inconsistency boil down to trying to explain why our distance measurements from the cosmic distance ladder are off, or why ΛCDM is wrong, or at least incomplete as a model. Multiple teams have tried to poke holes in different rungs of the ladder, with varying degrees of success, but recently a new bit of data analysis from some JWST data appears to confirm an earlier Hubble result for the first rung of the ladder.

TL;DR It's not certain and different ways of measuring it give different answers. This is a legitimate problem and has been called a crisis in cosmology!

AskScience,How do dogs not develop respiratory alkalosis when panting?,"Lung doctor here.

Dogs [do hyperventilate](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.01380.2005) when [they pant](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/y67-001), which can lead to respiratory alkalosis.

There are different levels of panting. At lower temperatures, the panting isn't as pronounced, and the amount of air moved is relatively small. Like the volume of air is 50 mL, and the volume of the airway is 100 mL. This airway volume is called anatomic dead space. It doesn't participate in gas exchange. In this case, there isn't any respiratory alkalosis.

However, if you agitate the air enough, the physiologic dead space will decrease. If the volume of air is 50 mL, but the dog is panting super fast, the air in the airway is mixing so much that there is increased gas exchange, and the dog will hyperventilate, which will result in respiratory alkalosis.

The ideal frequency of panting will depend on the resonant frequency of the respiratory system, so it is basically a function of the size of the animal.

In sick human patients, we used to use a mechanical ventilation mode called high frequency oscillatory ventilation, where we used tiny breath volumes much lower than anatomic dead space, and frequencies of 300-900 times a minute. It's the equivalent of panting. It was thought to protect the lung in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It fell out of favor after the [OSCILLATE trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215554), which was stopped early due to increased mortality. It's still used in kids. I think there was another study in kids that was going on but got derailed during COVID- I'm unsure of its current status. Anyway, in that mode of ventilation, you could definitely blow off carbon dioxide even though the tidal volume was less than the anatomic dead space.

When I teach this to students, I often use an analogy of someone lighting a scented candle in the corner of a room. It might take a few minutes for someone at the other end to smell it. But if there is a ton of agitation in the room, like fans or people moving around, you would likely smell it sooner."
AskScience,What do they do with stomach acid during surgeries involving the stomach?,"As a veterinarian I open stomachs all the time for foreign body etc … the stomach is packed off from rest of abdomen , we use stay sutures to hold incision away from viscera and the acid in the stomach is not strong enough to melt our surgical instruments - in addition if it’s a planned surgery the animal is faster so acid at a minimum- worst case scenario we also have suction tools to deflate a bloated stomach"
AskScience,"Are some North American bat species more likely to reside in man-made structures than others, or is the choice of habitat typically consistent across all bat species?","Yes, there a large differences in roost and habitat selection between species, and available habitat for maternity roosts is thought to limit the distribution of most species.  Many will use trees or rocks as roosting locations in the summer.  In winter some species (e.g., myotis species, tricolored bats) hibernate in caves or mines, while others migrate to Mexico or even further south (e.g., hoary bats, silver haired bats). As for human structures, big brown bats are the most commonly associated species, in fact they rarely will use natural roosts.  They are commonly found in cites and urban areas, and they tend to crowd out other species by direct (i.e., echolocation jamming) or indirect competition. Little brown bats and a few other myotis species (e.g., myotis volans and myotis evotis at higher elevations) also commonly use buildings in western North America, and some speculate they may have expanded their range into prairies and very cold regions by following European settlers. Finally, tricolored bats commonly roost in culverts, while Grey bats and Mexican free tailed bats commonly use roost under bridges. Bats are amazingly diverse and complex animals."
AskScience,How did Rutherford arrive at gold foil as the best choice for his particle experiments?,">is it because gold is so malleable but so is lead and lead is much more dense

Gold is much more dense than lead, at 19.3 vs 11.3 g/cm³, but the density of the metal isn't really a direct factor in Rutherford scattering in contrast to the atomic mass (more directly the atomic number, but this was prior to the discovery of the neutron) and atomic density. With gold being very close in atomic number to lead, and gold being more malleable and non-reactive than lead, and with gold foil more ubiquitous than lead foil, and with gold being more atomically dense than lead, there wouldn't have been an advantage to using lead over gold.

From [Geiger's 1910 paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1910.0038) on the early experiments:

*""Gold appeared to be the most suitable substance for such comparative measurements, since it can be obtained in very thin and uniform foils, and in addition its scattering power is higher than that of any other material available.""*

*""Since thin and uniform sheets could only be obtained for gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminium, the experiments were confined to these metals.""*

These and later experiments by [Geiger and Marsden](http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/geiger13/eng.pdf) under the supervision of Rutherford ultimately showed that scattering per atom was proportional to the square of the atomic weight. That is, other materials were observed, but since gold was far more suitable and lead was very close in atomic weight to gold, it would not have yielded much more insight compared to lighter and more malleable materials. It's important to note that thin sheets and uniform thickness were important because the scattering was also observed as a function of the number of sheets used.

In fact, it appears that [lead was used in the early experiments] (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1909.0054) but it was less effective than gold - this was speculated to be due to impurities in the lead but I believe atomic density would have played a role here, possibly also the relative difficulties in producing thin sheets of lead."
AskScience,How would the water cycle be affected if we were to switch to hydrogen as a fuel for the majority of cars?,"It depends on the source of the hydrogen. If hydrogen is obtained through electrolysis of water then the net change would be zero. However electrolysis of water is a relatively expensive way of obtaining hydrogen. 

Currently the most common way of obtaining hydrogen is through refining natural gas (natural gas reforming) or biomass gasification. Both process requires water in their chemical process However neither is carbon neutral and the refining process produces CO and CO2 so neither process really abates the accumulation of greenhouse gases. 

The hope is that renewable energy can be made cheap enough that electrolysis of water can be done economically to displace fossil or biomass sources of hydrogen. There are possibilities of genetic engineering bacteria’s that produces hydrogen as a byproduct through some kind of biological process which would be carbon neutral but this is still an area of active research.

All of that is the preface and context needed to answer your question. The amount of changes to the water cycle depends on how the hydrogen is primarily going to be sourced in the future. Both natural gas reforming and biomass gasification are water intensive chemical processes and may have impact on the local water source near where the refineries are located. On a planetary scale the consumption of natural gas derived hydrogen means an effective mass transfer of hydrogen in the form of hydrocarbons to the form of water. The amount of hydrocarbons on the earth is pretty insignificant compared to the amount of water on the planet so the net change in water through these process would be negligible (my assumption as I’m an engineer and not a geologist; please correct me if I’m wrong here).

If hydrogen is sourced from electrolysis using renewable energy then the local impact on the water cycle will again be dependent on where the water sources are drawn from. On a planetary scale there will be no net change in the amount of water on the planet. The water to hydrogen+water back to water cycle is essentially a means to store and transport the energy used for electrolysis."
AskScience,Do food crops contain the same level of nutrients as it used to?,"I think you've got the right idea for the wrong reason. Modern farms (even corporate Ag) use crop rotation extensively. That aside, if you rotate the right set of crops it doesn't take a huge set of crops in the rotation to maintain balanced nutrients. Also, the dustbowl was in the 1930s and was partially caused by monoculture, so its not a new problem. Also the Irish Famine.

More importantly to your question is plant variety. We are still actively breeding plants for new traits. Modern breeds are typically bred for ease of harvest, storage, and ""good taste"". The go to example being modern sweet corn which has quite different nutrition from older corn varieties.

So, I would say in general, if the crop is from a historical variety, everything else being equal, they would be the same. But, comparing new commercial varieties to historical ones, you'll probably find more varied and complex nutritional content in older breeds."

AskScience,Is there a fertile creature with an odd number of chromosomes?,"Even though “everyone knows” that mules are infertile, there are actually quite a few well documented cases of fertile mules. [This page](http://messybeast.com/genetics/hybrid-equines-3.htm) lists some older examples going back to the 19th century; some more recent (peer-reviewed) cases are listed in

* [A fertile mule and hinny in China](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3378453/)
* [Key Aspects of Donkey and Mule Reproduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749073919300525)

* [A foal from a mule in Morocco](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12570318/)

With dozens of instances being documented in spite of farmers actively trying to prevent mules and hinnies from breeding, it's likely that a fairly significant percentage (though of course a minority) of them are fertile.

There are several cases of plants with odd numbers of chromosomes, such as [Homeria flavescens (2n = 9)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2418516). These plants can generally (always?) reproduce through self-compatibility and  autogamy, which reduces the issues of odd chromosome numbers.

AskScience,"So what exactly makes shaving creams or foam effective? What gives it the advantage over soap & water or other viscous liquids, such as shower gels?","The advantage seems to be moot or nonexistent?

Most shaving creams are 1/3rd soap and 10% foaming agents, emulsifiers and the like. 
(Kirk-Othmer Chemical Technology of Cosmetics, pp. 36–37)

The first shaving cream sold commercially seems to be Barbasol in 1919, and the main selling point was that it was easier/faster then working soap into a lather by hand or brush. 
(https://barbasol.com/pages/our-history)

Eventually they came pressurized, and then most of the industry adopted that. Nowadays you have those gels that turn to foam while you work with them too. 

But really, content wise they seem to often be soap/water plus methods of dispersal/binding. An advantage from earlier in history was ease of use, that has extended out to make shaving cream/foam a mainstay today? Though thats conjecture honestly."
AskScience,Will the contents of landfills eventually fossilize?,"Under pressure, landfills are unlikely to have their objects slowly replaced by dissolved calcium.

AskScience,"I saw in a video that chimpanzees and gorillas do not knuckle-walk in the same way, but they didn't explain what the difference is. Could someone elaborate on the physiological/anatomical differences?","Gorillas use columnar knucke-walking, where the wrist and hand joints are aligned in a relatively neutral, straight position, which helps with weight bearing. Gorillas are not as arboreal (tree-dwelling) as chimpanzees, so their form of knuckle-walking evolved to maximize terrestrial movement, as well as the aformentioned weight-bearing.

Chimpanzees knuckle-walk with extended wrists, which is due to the fact that they, like most primates, extend their wrists to preserve their balance while engaging in arboreal activities. Due to this need to extend their wrists to preserve balance and protect themselves in an uncontrollable fall, the chimpanzee's wrist bone anatomy has evolved to differ from that of a gorilla, which results in a different form of knuckle-walking."

AskScience,"Physically, what makes a recessive gene recessive?","So, it's not the gene itself that's dominant or recessive - it's traits resulting from variations in that gene (different variations of a gene are called alleles). 

Genes typically encode a protein that has a specific function in the cell. For example, a gene might encode an enzyme that makes the pigment that makes eyes brown. Another allele of that gene might make a protein that is non-functional. If we have one copy of the functional gene, and one of the non-functional, pigment is still made and the eyes are still brown. So brown eyes are a dominant trait because you only need one copy of that allele. Blue eyes only happen when you have two non-functional copies and so no pigment is made at all.

Basically - in the majority of cases, recessive traits are those that result from an allele which has a loss of function, and dominant ones from an allele that is still working. In practice there are complications and exceptions to this, but that is the basic principle."

AskScience,Does the metal in the solid core of a rocky planet have any special properties?,"> it's probably a large mix of metals but it's probably the heaviest metals in the inner core right?

Actually, no. The core is predominantly iron with a smaller amount of nickel (and some other stuff, more on that in the next section), which while both dense, are certainly not the most dense metals that exists on Earth and in fact, many significantly more dense metals tend to be concentrated in either the crust or mantle as opposed to the core. The reason for this largely relates back to the early formation of rocky planets (and here most of my answer will focus on Earth, but this is broadly applicable to rocky planets more generally). During [planetary differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation), there are two primary ways by which materials separated, physically (i.e., mostly on the basis of density) and chemically. For the chemical differentiation aspect, it's useful to consider the [Goldschmit classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification) of the elements. Regardless of their density, generally [lithophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification#Lithophile_elements) elements, which are those that easily combine with oxygen, and [chalcophile elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification#Chalcophile_elements), which are those that easily combine with sulfur and a few other elements, were incorporated into the silicate part of the Earth and thus remained in the mantle and crust. As examples, very dense metals like uranium and lead are both thought to generally be in very low (to zero) concentrations in the core. This is because uranium is a lithophile and lead is a chalcophile so both are generally concentrated in the crust and mantle (not to mention that a non-trivial component of lead results from the decay of uranium and thorium, both lithophiles, after differentiation). [Siderophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification#Siderophile_elements) were those that easily dissolved in iron and thus ended up primarily in the core. The density driven portion of differentiation provided the main division between the denser, inner iron-nickel core and the less dense, outer silicate portion of the Earth, but whether a particular element ended up in the silicate portion or the core came down to the individual chemical properties of the element in question, i.e. was it more likely to bond or dissolve in a silicate melt vs an iron melt.

> Not sure if it would make a tough alloy or something.

As discussed above, the core is predominantly iron with a small amount of nickel (constrained to being around 5%), so usually described as an iron-nickel alloy. However, we know from a variety of different datasets that the density of the core is actually less than what you'd expect for pure iron or a 95-5% iron-nickel alloy (and that various other properties, mostly related to how seismic waves pass through it are similarly not consistent with a pure iron or a pure iron-nickel alloy) and that the core must include some amount of a light element or several light elements. As highlighted in the review by [Hirose et al., 2013](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-earth-050212-124007), on the basis of abundances (i.e., what elements were present) and their ability to partition into the core during planet formation, we hypothesize that these light elements are silicon, oxygen, sulfur, carbon, and/or hydrogen. In terms of the properties of the resulting alloy, a lot depends on which one of these (or which mixture of these) are actually present in the core. The Hirose review goes through some of the details of specific two-component alloys (e.g., Fe-C, Fe-Si, etc) from high pressure/temperature experiments, but for some of these it's actually pretty challenging to get them to alloy with iron given the conditions we can and cannot simulate in experiments. Checking in on a more current review by [Hirose et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00203-6) ([pdf or a preprint of this article here](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10134605/1/Vocadlo_Hirose%20NatureReviews%20final%20ms.pdf)), we find the situation pretty much the same, i.e., we still think that the core needs some light elements, the list of the possible ones are the same, and we still don't really know which ones are the right ones within that list. What this new review does provide is updated indications of just how much of different elements might be present. These have ranges of uncertainties, but most max out at ~1-5%, but it varies by element and by the way the estimate is derived. The extent to which any of these alloys would be ""tough"" is a bit unclear since (1) that's not exactly a clear property, (2) we don't know the exact composition, and (3) it's hard to get materials up to the relevant temperature and pressures to do detailed studies of the material properties in the same way we would for an alloy that's stable at surface temps and pressures.

EDIT: I'll add that we can learn some details about the cores of rocky planets from the study of [iron meteorites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_meteorite), which are generally thought to be chunks of differentiated bodies that were destroyed during the early history of the solar system. Since they're no longer at core temperatures and pressures, the exact properties of these are a bit different than what you'd expect if they were at core temperatures and pressures, but they definitely inform a bit on composition. I'll also highlight the upcoming [Psyche](https://www.nasa.gov/psyche) NASA mission, which is going to visit the [16-Psyche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche) asteroid, which is might be a large chunk of a left over core of a planetesimal."

AskScience,What evolutionary advantage is there for your teeth to cause pain?,"These answers are kind of wild.

Ok so I'm a dentist and I'll give my 2 cents.

So first of all, the nerves that tell you that you are biting are not IN the tooth, but *around* the tooth -- specifically in the periodontal ligament.  This is a thin layer of tissue that stretches, and that stretching or compression tell your brain what you are chewing is either soft or hard. If I put a blindfold on you and put something in your mouth like a potato chip and you bite down, you know immediately that it's crispy and you adjust your force accordingly.   A denture does not give this feedback.  There are lots of studies to show that chewing with dentures is decidedly worse than real teeth, and this is a principle reason.

Ok so the chewing and feedback is from around the tooth -- the connection between the tooth and the jawbone.  What about the nerves *INSIDE* the teeth?  Why do you feel pain there?

Teeth are *alive*. They feel temperature. There is blood inside the tooth.  The tooth *lays down more dentin throughout our lives*, making the dentin layer thicker and the pulp layer thinner.  The reason it's there in the first place is because that's how your tooth was made.

I'm simplifyung things, but have two types of hard tissue-making cells for your tooth.  The first at ameloblasts, the second are odontoblasts.  They are buddies until the start growing your tooth.  The former grows OUT, and the later grows IN, and KEEPS GROWING IN until the tooth dies or there is essentially no pulp left.

Note: if your pulp gets SUPER thin, you can't feel temperature anymore.

So why do you feel pain inside?  Because it's messing with the tooth trying to make more dentin -- something is messing up the process.  Bacteria, trauma, etc.  Bacteria make abscesses in teeth, and that hurts.  Putting pressure on that tooth will injure it more.  Teeth are special in that it won't get better on its own, mostly because the blood supply inside the tooth sucks, so your immune response sucks."

AskScience,"Does the body constantly produce vitamin D when out in the sun, or does it get to a point where it's got enough and shuts down the process?","You can't OD on sun derived vitamin D. 

Sunlight, to be precise UVB rays in the range of 290-315nm, break a B ring bond in 7-dihydrocholesterol, also called pro-vitamin D3, the result is pre-vitamin D3. 

According to your body's needs some of this pre-vitamin D will be turned to vitamin D3, the rest will be turned to inactive by-products lumisterol and tachysterol. The latter can be turned back to pre-D if needed. 

In short, once pre-vit D is synthesized it turns either to D3 or inactive metabolites. This is the mechanism that protects from OD. 

Further, D3 is also inactive, but when your calcium levels drop, parathyroid hormone stimulates the kidneys to produce the active form of vitamin D, 1,25 OH2D3. The active form increases the absorption of calcium in the intestines.

Good to know: vitamin D3 can be stored in adipose tissue for up to two months. D3 has a half-life of 72 hours while that of 1,25 OH2D3 is 4 hours."

AskScience,How did scientists determined that Oumuamua was an interstellar object?,"Speed.

The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ʻOumuamua) discusses this fairly well.

To dig a bit deeper, however, it may help to understand what we know and what we conclude from this evidence/knowledge along with a slew of other assumptions.

Once we discovered it, we watched it for a while with the goal of determining its movement.  Usually we assume any object we find is not accelerating on its own.  As such, we expect it to have an orbit.  With enough measurements of its location, we can calculate the orbit around the Sun.

In this particular case, the measurements showed us it was not in an orbit around the Sun at all.  It was moving fast enough that it was just-a-passing-through.

Now... what does this mean?  All we really know here is that we found something moving fast enough that it's not in an orbit around the Sun.

We add to this a bit more knowledge (or the limits of our knowledge) as well as some basic assumptions.

First, we know of no mechanism that would facilitate an item of solar origin to get to this speed.  I'm really only repeating the Wikipedia writeup here.  But for reference, we used gravity assists for our extra-solar probes.  The fastest of those (Voyager 1) reached almost 17 km/s (relative to the Sun). 'Oumuamua clocked in at almost 50 km/s when we first measured it.

Next, if we just continue with the assumption that this is a natural object with no self-propulsion mechanism, and that it has existed for a long time (you know... that it didn't just magically appear one day with a given speed), then we are led to the conclusion that it originated somewhere other than the solar system."

AskScience,"Why does respiratory rate increase during anaerobic exercise if muscles use glycogen as fuel, not oxygen?","During intense exercise you reach an anaerobic threshold, this is the point at which the demand for energy outstrips the ability of the body to supply energy using solely aerobic metabolism. At this point anaerobic metabolism doesn’t become the sole mechanism, it supplements your maximal aerobic capacity, so you will still need a high respiratory rate to continue what aerobic metabolism you can. 

Both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism produce CO2 as a waste product which is excreted by exhalation. Humans have a fairly low tolerance for increases in CO2 in the bloodstream as it decreases pH, as will the production of lactate from anaerobic respiration. The initial attempts to compensate for an acidaemia is by respiratory compensation- you ‘blow off’ your CO2 to bring the pH back to the normal range. A high production of CO2 is detected by specialised chemoreceptors in the bloodstream and will trigger a drive to increase respiratory rate in order to correct CO2 and keep blood biochemistry as stable as possible, so excess CO2 in itself will give you a high respiratory rate"

AskScience,Does the age of the universe depends on where you are?,"When we say that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, this is actually in the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background, not that of the Earth. However, the difference due to gravitational time dilation (mostly due to the galactic potential) and kinematic time dilation (since we're moving at ~370 km/s with respect to the cosmic microwave background) is of order one part in a million, so any ambiguity in the age of the universe due to time dilation is much smaller than the measurement uncertainty in the ""13.7 billion years"" value.

More generally, the question of whether the age of the universe depends on where you are depends entirely on what convention you adopt. There is no such thing as a universal ""now"". If you wanted, you could *define* that ""now"" means the elapsed time, in the cosmic microwave background frame, is 13.7 billion years.

Quite how they know which colours to do and how they coordinate it is still in I'm pretty sure, but a large proportion of their big brain is dedicated to colour change.

Edit: one thing I didn't clarify well is that there's one pigment per cell and the cells are distributed evenly across the skin, rather than each cell containing every pigment. 

The cells are called chromatophores

AskScience,"We have heard about development of synthetic meats, but have there been any attempts to synthesize animal fat cells or bone marrow that might scale up for human consumption?","My time to shine. I'm in the industry.

Yes, all kinds of animals cells can be grown, the main issue facing the industry right now is efficient scaling up. Efficient as in money efficient.

The equipment it takes to produce grams right now cost in the range of several hundred Ks. We don't expect equipment prices to come down immediately, but perhaps in the next few years. The challenge is to produce kilograms in bigger equipment and then eventually tonnes.

Growing fat cells or muscle cells or stomach cells or intestine cells is just a matter of choosing which part of the original animal to biopsy from, and tweaking ingredients to suit what those cells like.

I don't know if any of our competitors are using stem cells, but we certainly aren't. The complexity involved in differentiating them correctly is not worth the time, plus we can't say if the specimen is healthy by using stem cells."
AskScience,"I’m watching a Spark show on Neanderthals that says most humans have 2-4% Neanderthal DNA, except Africans. Because Neanderthals roamed far and wide, except not to Africa. But didn’t they come from Africa? Didn’t all Homos evolve in Africa?","Here, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early\_human\_migrations#/media/File:Spread\_and\_evolution\_of\_Denisovans.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations#/media/File:Spread_and_evolution_of_Denisovans.jpg), you can see the graph that probably would make it clearer.

In gist, the Homo line that became modern human (which stayed in Africa) split from the Homo line that became Neanderthal and Denisovan which spreaded into Europe and Asia first.  The African line that eventually became H. sapiens spreaded into Europe & Asia later and crossbred with Neanderthal in Europe/Asia, but not the H. sapiens that remained in Africa."
AskScience,Do people with tetrachromacy or colorblindness experience seasonal affective disorder at the same rate and intensity as people with trichromacy?,"There is research indicating that the pathway for SAD is through a different receptor in the eye,  known as the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), rather than through the cones used to detect color.  

See paper here as an example of this research:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30173913/

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/12/21/678342879/scientists-find-a-brain-circuit-that-could-explain-seasonal-depression


So while I dont have any direct studies that would quantify the rate at which colorblind people experience SAD compared to normal color vision, it would be unexpected to find a rate difference based on the actual pathway being part of a different receptor in the eyes than the cones used for color vision."
AskScience,Could air pressure alone be used to support a sealed tunnel?,"Submarines are not pressurised; they use the strength of the hull to keep the internal air pressure close to surface normal.

Diving with ordinary air only works down to a depth of about 50 metres, and even that depth has serious difficulties and requires gradual decompression.  Allowing that rocks and soil are generally over twice as dense as water, even a tunnel only 20 metres underground would require air pressures high enough to be dangerous for people, assuming you're asking the air pressure to support the ceiling."
AskScience,How is the environment/humanity not affected by the hundreds (or thousands) of tests of nuclear bombs over the last century?,"The large number of open air tests in the 1950s and 1960s did indeed start to cause alarm due to their effects on the environment. The effect of these tests is clear in the abundance of carbon-14 in the atmosphere. Carbon-14 is an unstable element that turns into nitrogen with a half-life of about 6000 years. It is created naturally by the radiation from the Sun. This keeps the Carbon 14 fraction in the atmosphere somewhat steady (which is part of why carbon dating works - when a plant or animal dies, it stops bringing in carbon-14 from the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon-14 inside the plant or animal decreases over time). However, the neutrons produced during the tests in the 50s and 60s [dramatically increased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-14#/media/File:Radiocarbon_bomb_spike.svg) the amount of Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, up to basically double its baseline rate in some places. After that peak, the quantity of Carbon-14 has gradually decreased over the past decades, because all tests have to be underground. With underground tests, there is still a release of radioactive materials, but it is much more contained. There is a risk of contaminating water supplies etc, but it's not nearly as dangerous as blowing stuff up in the open air.

So yes, if we continued with those open air tests, there might have been a major problem. However, the tests were moved underground, where the spread of radioactive material is more contained. The evolution of the carbon-14 fraction over times shows that these measures seem to have been successful, as the amount of unstable carbon-14 has decreased to within ~20% of its pre-nuclear level."

The only real downside to SYNAGIS is you have to take it once a month.

To answer the question: It isn't that we are close, we have one, but it isn't widely available as of yet and is taking the (very slow) approval path that vaccine without emergency authorizations like the COVID-19 vaccine received. It also isn't something that got massive funding and approval by every major nation on the planet.

AskScience,Do astronauts loose hair cause problems on the ISS?,"This is indeed a big consideration if it comes to operating spacecraft. The air is being kept moving to prevent the formation of CO2 bubbles and to keep dust particles (such as hair) from floating around. You don't want the astronauts breathing in the wrong stuff.

So, the air is moved around by a lot of fans. The station is quite the noisy place because of this. There's also a bunch of air filters to clean up the circulating air, and one of the astronaut's duty is maintaining them (vacuuming, seal checks, etc..)."

AskScience,Do they always take the same kidney for transplants?,"In a live donor, the left kidney is preferentially taken for transplant. [This picture](https://teachmesurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Renal-Transplant-Annotated.jpg.webp) shows the kidneys in their natural place as you’d see them when face-to-face with someone, and the two ways they can be implanted (labeled A & B). As you can see, the left kidney (on the right in the image) has a longer renal vein than the right kidney, since it must cross over the midline to reach the inferior vena cava (large vertical vein, in case you don’t know), which lies on the right side of the body.

Veins are much harder to suture and connect than arteries. Veins are thinner and have a much thinner muscular layer, and have a consistency closer to wet paper compared to the rubber tube consistency of arteries. The longer vein makes it easier to connect up during the implantation procedure. This assumes that anatomy is otherwise normal; if any of the vessels (ureter isn’t technically a vessel, but also counts) are duplicated, that might prompt a right kidney to be taken instead, but it typically comes down to which one would be easier to implant.

Disclaimer: I haven’t yet completed my general surgery training, nor have I gone through my time on our transplant service yet, so my hands-on experience is minimal. I will still defer to those further trained than me."
AskScience,"Radon is a monatomic gas, but its decay products are solids. After a decay, what happens to the individual atoms of the daughter elements? Do they stay suspended in the atmosphere or slowly rain out?","A single atom doesn't have a state of matter. Radon-222 decays lead to a couple of short-living (half life under an hour) nuclei in the decay chain until it becomes ~~lead-214~~ lead-210 with a half life of 22 years. As bulk matter all these decay products are solid but you don't get macroscopic amounts of them. As individual atoms they can stay in the air or get captured by some liquid or solid surface - including dust particles.

An isolated lead atom in the air is just a very heavy atom that bounces around randomly just like all other atoms and molecules."
AskScience,How rice paddies don't drain while in use?,"We brought rice to the water, not water to the rice...for the most part.  


Rice actually doesn't need all that water to grow. It can be grown as a dry crop like wheat. The reason that we usually see rice as grown in wet fields is because the plant can survive in lightly flooded area where other plants can't...specifically weeds. When rice is grown in a lightly flooded area the weeds that would normally take up space, light, and nutrition have a harder time surviving, as do many insects that would damage the crop.  


This means that they are not doing anything to the area to create the flood possibility...rather that is an area that historically floods because it is a flat region with a water table that is close to the surface. Rice farmers have started to artificially create floods in those regions through levies and dams, piping, or other means but most of the time those regions were prone to flooding already.  


If you wanted to make a pond in a region that normally wouldn't contain one then there are a lot of ways to go about doing that. Changing soil composites, using plastic ground cover, cement and other products, all can help create a pond by inhibiting drainage.

AskScience,Do people that frequently have Lipomas and other types of benign tumors have a higher chance of developing cancer in the future?,"""Benign tumours"" casts a very wide net and some firm definitions would be needed to delve into the specifics of the majority. I presume this question is being asked as you or a family member has multiple lipomata.

Lipomata are not fully understood - we interpret them as predominantly benign adipose tumours that occur in many populations, not just humans. Contemporary thought suggests those with the Murine Double Minute 2 gene are more ""atypical"" and thus have a greater chance to grow aggressively (locally) relative to a standard lipomatous lesion. This does not necessarily mean they are malignant though. Of course they may end up being liposarcomas, but these are super rare. So all in all, the more lipomas an individual has you could suggest they are more likely to have one that is aggressive and possibly malignant purely based on the sheer number.  The rate is negligible though and on a practical basis you're more likely to get another harmful cell type malignancy. As others have pointed out there is not much point researching further into lipomas because the morbidity and mortality is tiny.

Other lesions can be associated with increased risk of malignancy, however; epidermoid cysts are very common and are never aggressive; although, for instance, a lot of them being present can be sequelae to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) aka Gardner Syndrome in which polyps grow and almost always progress to malignancy unless treated. Although you would suppose that is not the lesion itself being cancerous, just associated.

Much like all of medical science, there aren't black and white rules to lumps and bumps; just trends, relationships, and probabilities. The likelihood of a lipoma turning nasty is very very low (e.g. NHS sarcoma service data suggests the UK gets <1000 full blown liposarcoma diagnoses in total in a year, when you consider how many lipomas there are around the ratio is absurd).

AskScience,"What will be the environmental impact of de-orbiting 42,000 Starlink satellites every five years? (Explanation in post)","It's a good question, but one that does not seem like it's answered yet (though it is theoretically addressable with global climate models, etc). There are a variety of papers in the last few years highlighting that both emissions from increasingly frequent rocket launches and material (like aluminum and other metals) added to the atmosphere via satellite deorbiting *could* have substantial impacts on a variety of things, but almost all of these are really calls for more attention and research as opposed to answers to the question itself (e.g., [Ross & Toohey, 2019](https://eos.org/features/the-coming-surge-of-rocket-emissions), [Hobbs et al., 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMGC0420004H/abstract), [Boley & Byers, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89909-7), [Schulz & Glassmeier, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273117720307663), [Adilov et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0265964621000631), [Ross & Jones, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468896722000386), [Shutler et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01001-5), [Lawrence et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01655-6)). There is at least one paper directly trying to answer this with modelling for the emissions from increasingly frequent rocket launches (e.g., [Maloney et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JD036373)), but I at least could not find a paper actually demonstrating what the impact of addition of significant amounts of metal to the upper atmosphere would be (beyond the generalizations in the previously linked papers that suggest it would likely do something). The closest is really the Hobbs et al., 2020, but sadly this is an abstract for a conference presentation and I couldn't find a follow up (might still be in the works, lag time between stuff presented at conferences and eventual publication can definitely be several years). It does seem like there is a fair bit of interest in this within pockets of the scientific community (as illustrated by all the ""we should pay attention to this"" papers cited above), so I wouldn't be surprised if there are studies in the works on this, but at least for me it's far enough outside my area that I don't know that for sure (maybe others more in this space can provide some details)."
AskScience,How do medical researchers obtain lab animals with diseases like specific forms of cancer which arise spontaneously? Do they raise thousands of apes and hope some eventually develop the disease?,"Almost nobody works with primates anymore and we don’t really do transgenic primates. For lots of animals we do. Mice are the “work horse” for genetic models. Fruit flies, and rats, and zebrafish to some extent too (and yes others). Yes we can breed colonies with specific traits. Then we keep inbreeding them to keep their mutations. That’s like the old school way.

Then came things like the Cre-Lox system. You can use bacteria to make a bunch of DNA with specific sequences that include sites where it can be cut. You can add it to an embryo and have these DNA sequences integrate at specific sites by making the DNA sequence the same as where you want it integrated because every strand of DNA has a complement. You can then cause specific mutations at these sites as an embryo or even in a way you can trigger with chemicals so that the mutation can be triggered at any time at specific tissues. Then you can maintain a colony with inbreeding. 

Now the new, new way is to use CRISPR which lets you do this much more consistently with a lot less effort. Then you can inbreed to maintain a colony."
AskScience,"Nitrogen is a gas that pretty much no one cares about and our bodies don't metabolize it, yet it makes up 79% of the air we breathe. Given that we only require oxygen, could you replace nitrogen with any other inert gas and breathe just fine?","Scuba divers, both commercial and technical, replace nitrogen with helium in order to reduce the narcotic effect of nitrogen at depth, allowing for safer diving below recreational limits. The most common gas mixture is called trimix, which is blend of nitrogen, helium, and oxygen, though commercial divers operating at extreme depths have used a helium/oxygen mixture.

The depth at which helium should be introduced is a little bit of a debate in the technical community, but generally somewhere between 100' and 130' trimix is preferred today. Plenty of ""old school"" divers will use air well past these limits (helium is quite expensive) but it is generally not a good idea.

Trimix also has the advantage of allowing a lower fraction of O2 (FO2) in your mixture; breathing high partial pressures of oxygen can cause significant pulmonary and/or central nervous system problems, so a lower FO2 can make a gas safer at depth. Some mixes for very deep dives are so hypoxic they are not safe to breath on the surface.

These gases are breathed for relatively short periods of time, I cannot speak for the effect of long term exposure."
AskScience,How big can a single molecule get?,"Vulcanized rubber(and some other polymers) is often considered to be a single molecule. Meaning there is no practical size limit to what one can consider a molecule.

AskScience,Do rainforests at higher latitudes have shorter trees because of higher wind speeds?,"This is definitely on the edge of my expertise and I will happily defer to any more plant science adjacent folks out there with relevant details, but this seems largely based on some flawed premises and/or misunderstanding of the term ""impoverished"" as used in this context. If we consider global estimations of canopy height (i.e., how tall trees are) as presented in any number of publications (e.g., [Simard et al., 2011](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JG001708), [Zhang et al., 2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.12510), [Lang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425721004806)), we can see some broad latitudinal patterns in average canopy heights, but (as well illustrated by the graphical abstract figure of Lang) these are not simple, especially if you consider the maximums, i.e., mean heights generally peak around the equator, but max heights are actually greater in the mid-latitudes and there are local differences in mean (like those in the southern mid-latitudes) that approach the means seen in the equatorial regions. Probably the most relevant answer comes in the Zhang et al., 2015 paper, which directly addresses latitudinal patterns, i.e., that they exist and generally suggest a decrease away from the equator, but (1) highlight there is a lot of variability in this and (2) the patterns that do exist largely reflect changes in water-energy details, i.e., how much precipitation vs potential and actual evapotranspiration occurs. Thus, generally, average wind speeds are not really a huge factor in this, though average wind speed does factor into [some calculations of potential evapotranspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_evaporation), but again more in the sense of changing the water balance through evaporative potential (and things like mean annual temperature, etc are going to generally be a larger factor), not through a direct wind forced cap on the height of trees."
AskScience,What is the smallest possible black hole?,"Primordial black holes are a theoretical byproduct of the big bang. When everything was so incredibly dense and close together, it allowed atomic structures that were even slightly more dense than the area around it to potentially collapse into black holes. It's believed that these theoretical black holes became the catalyst for bigger black holes later in their life and that the smallest possible existing black holes would be around the size of a proton. Obviously we've never witnessed examples of these types before, but it's the main theory as of now."

AskScience,Why do satellites need to thrust to maintain orbit?,"The main reason is because the Earth's atmosphere doesn't just ""end"" at any place, but instead gets thinner and thinner the higher up you get (it can be described by an exponential decay function quite accurately, actually). 

Thus, all satellites orbiting the Earth will eventually need some station keeping, but the lower you are (like the ISS or Starlink) the more atmosphere there still is, and thus a little bit of drag slowing you down. 

At the altitude of the ISS, the atmosphere is about 3E-10% (or 0.0000000003%) as thick as it is at the surface of the Earth which is enough for the [ISS to lose about 100 m a day of altitude due to atmospheric drag, and thus has to be re-boosted periodically](https://www.esa.int/Education/Space_In_Bytes/ATV_a_very_special_delivery_-_Lesson_notes)."
AskScience,Can teeth really get regrown with stem cells?,"There's more than one problem to solve for this to be a viable treatment. The problem is not only 'Can we regrow teeth from stem cells?', we already know that that might be possible. But how do we get the tooth bud safely and predictably in just the right spot so that the tooth grows in straight and functional and not crooked? What if there's not enough bone in the site were we want to regrow the tooth? How long will it eventually take from tooth loss to fully regrown tooth? How expensive is this going to be? How will the tooth look, will it need a crown right away to function properly and blend in esthetically with the other teeth?

I think we might be able to see the first regrown human tooth in the next 10-15 years. But it won't be viable in a clinical setting for a long, long time, and even then it will be a super high-end treatment option and not easily accessible for anyone. Right now, an implant (which is the gold standard treatment for lost teeth) will cost you about 3000-5000 USD, it will take about 3-6 months from start to finish and by now it's a very predictable and proven treatment option. An implant however is not a perfect replacement of a natural tooth, it comes with its own risks and disadvantages, but it's the best we have right now. Surely, a regrown tooth would be better than an implant in some regards but it would have to outperform implants in more than one category to become the new gold standard. They would be prohibitively expensive, they would only be available in very specialized clinics (as opposed to implants which are placed in many regular dental offices across the globe) and it'll probably take longer too. So don't expect any miracles soon."
AskScience,Is the arid region on the NW corner of the Island of Hawai'i a rain shadow from Kohala or the result of human ranch & forestry management?,"Hi, I'm from a different island on Hawaii and I've driven this road many times. It's absolutely a rain shadow effect.  As you drive through Waimea town from east to west, the weather changes almost instantly from overcast and rainy to clear blue skies.  Here's a [rainfall map](http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/interactivemap.html): five miles east of Waimea, it rains 90 inches a year.  Five miles west, it's 20 inches a year.  By the time you get to the Kohala coast, it's cactus country.  And the Waipio Valley, the extra-green bit north of Waimea, gets like 150 inches a year.

There's definitely some land management in the area, some of the area east of Waimea is green and rainy but *not* forested, which in Hawaii is a sure sign that somebody's chopping trees, but the dramatic green-to-brown contrast you see in satellite photos is one of the most spectacular demonstrations of the rain shadow effect you'll ever see."
AskScience,Is dark matter orbiting galaxies with the same speed as normal matter?,"Since they are both subject to the same gravitational forces, dark and ordinary matter at the same location orbit at similar *average speeds*. However, dark matter has a much broader distribution of velocities, both in magnitude and direction.

Basically, ordinary matter is able to cool via inelastic collisions, causing it to lose energy but not angular momentum. Thus it tends to settle into configurations that reduce the ratio of energy to angular momentum, like disks. Note that collisions alone don't suffice for this; energy loss is needed. Within a disk, particles have largely coherent velocities with only a small spread. For example, material within our section of the disk orbits at roughly 220 km/s, but its velocity dispersion is only in the tens of km/s. (The velocity dispersion is the root-mean-squared deviation from the average velocity.)

In contrast, dark matter has no coherent motion, instead moving in random directions with a wide spread of speeds. The local dark matter velocity dispersion is something like 270 km/s.

(It should be noted, though, that many galaxies don't have disks. Only gas cools; stars are essentially collisionless, just like dark matter. So for example, if a galaxy's mass gets significantly redistributed, perhaps due to a merger, after it has converted its gas into stars, then the stars will not reform a disk.)"
AskScience,"Why can't the Gardasil vaccine rid you of the HPV strains you have, but can give protection from the ones that you don't have?","Gardasil contains the major capsid protein (L1) from different HPV types. Thus, vaccination results in immunity against the viral capsid (the shell of the virus), preventing new infection with HPV. 

However, previous HPV infection that results in viral integration (like what would cause cervical cancer, etc) drives expression of the major HPV oncoproteins, E6 and E7. Gardasil doesn’t contain those proteins, so the vaccine doesn’t induce immunity to them. However, there are several academic and industry groups developing E6 and E7 vaccines that could be used therapeutically to treat previous HPV infection/HPV-associated cancers."
AskScience,Can a chronic infection be annihilated if you strengthen the immune system?,"If you are a person with a normal immune system (meaning you do not have some sort of immune deficiency) the answer is no. A normal immune system is very aggressive at fighting off these invaders. But some pathogens have found ways to get around the immune system in some way or another. How they do that varies quite a bit. So if you are infected with a chronic infection by say a bacteria, then likely you harbor one that has evolved ways to get around the immune system. This is why we have to sometimes give people antibiotics since some pathogens can't be cleared by the immune system. Now about the immune system itself. Again with a normal immune system it is very aggressive, making it more aggressive through some means can have bad or even deadly effect on your health. The types of things you mentioned don't really affect immune function, nor do supplements you see out there that claim to ""boost"" the immune system. If they truly did boost immune activity you would probably be in trouble. A real life example of further unleashing the immune system is some of our newer cancer treatments such as check point inhibitors for example. In this case you are removing a ""brake""  that keeps the immune system from being more aggressive. There are a lot of side effects associated with doing this, some quite severe, and sometimes people will even die from such treatments, not from the cancer, but from unleashing the immune system in such a way. You would be surprised how aggressive a normal healthy immune system is in fighting off pathogens. As long as you don't have some condition that impairs your immunity and you otherwise take care of your health, your immune system is about as aggressive as you want it to be. Anymore you are going to start having health issues related to immune activity itself."
AskScience,What is the actual mechanism by which the body generates a fever?,"You are right, it is surprisingly difficulty to find the type of information you are asking about when you include the word ""fever"" in your search.

&#x200B;

Our body heat is regulated by our body's ability to balance of how much heat we generate and how much heat we lose to the environment.  

Here are some examples of  heat production (notice how many are simply the result of normal metabolims):   
\-Basal metabolism  
\-Muscle activity, by shivering and muscle contractions  
\-Extra metabolism caused by the effect of sympathetic stimulation and norepinephrine, -epinephrine on the cells  
\-Extra metabolism caused by increased chemical activity in the cells, especially when the cell -temperature increases  
\-Extra metabolism caused by thyroid hormone and, to a lesser extent, testosterone and -growth hormone on the cells  
\-Extra metabolism needed for digestion, absorption, and storage of food  
\-Most of the heat produced in the body is generated in the liver, brain, heart, and skeletal -0--muscles during exercise.  


And we balance that by also regulating mechanisms of heat Loss which is determined almost entirely by:  
\-How rapidly heat transfers from the skin to the surroundings  
\-How rapidly heat is conducted from where it is produced in the body core to the skin

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499843/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499843/)

A fever triggers an adjustment of where that balance is, so as metabolic processes are triggered to run hotter, our circulatory system is triggered to allow less heat loss through our skin, and we don't sweat. 

The term ""a fever broke"" is referring to a person who after a fever has begun to sweat to allow for the rapid loss of all that heat.

Normally by the time you feel symptoms the concentration of the virus in your body has already begun to decrease thanks to the immune response.

This is true of influenza and many other viruses. The time it takes between you getting infected and symptom onset is called the incubation period and it's normally more than 24 hours for influenza.

For Covid-19 the average incubation period is several days, but you could be spreading the virus for 24 hours or a little longer before you first feel symptoms.

You feel fine, but you are highly contagious. Because you feel fine you are likely to be near people and talking to them in close proximity. This is where the virus shines. As you speak, microscopic spit balls filled with virions are floating through the air and those nearby are breathing them in.

Emergency rooms will normally see an spike in influenza this time of year in the US. A few days after friends and family congregated closely together for Thanksgiving.

Edit: Peak concentration is typically reached \*shortly after feeling symptoms\* rather than shortly before as stated above."

AskScience,Why are there no natural caves at the Wieliczka Salt Mine?,"Large bodies of salt are slightly plastic under great pressure. Therefore, cavities in underground salt bodies tend to fill in over time. Here's some research on how fast it happens, citing 1% per year: [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3093924318ddf5d3f080466d8d87c568ab978cc8](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3093924318ddf5d3f080466d8d87c568ab978cc8)

This is actually used to advantage in deep repositories for gases because the walls of salt cavern have very low permeability. Cracks tend to close, so the bulk salt body has very low pororosity. See  [https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/download/planning\_factsheets/mpf\_storage.pdf](https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/download/planning_factsheets/mpf_storage.pdf) for a general information sheet covering storage of many things in salt caverns.

It is also an advantage for geologic storage of nuclear material, where the expectation is that the salt surrounding the material will deform plastically over time, ensuring that the material remains sealed and is not subject to penetration by flowing ground water. See for example [https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1206/ML12068A057.pdf](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1206/ML12068A057.pdf)

The group subsequently published a more complete study, which was inconclusive:

AskScience,Does treatment with daily antihistamines have an effect on the severity of other allergies like food or medication allergies?,"The simple answer is yes but the more complex answer is maybe.

To understand what an antihistamine is, you have to first understand what a histamine is. A histamine, in simplest terms, is a compound involved in local immune responses and a neurotransmitter. It is this compound which triggers many allergic reactions, mainly by binding a cell's histamine receptor. There are 4 types of histamine receptors, aptly numerated by H1-H4.

An antihistamine is a classification of drugs which counters the activation of a cell's histamine receptor by blocking the receptor without triggering a response (receptor antagonist). Though it is commonly understood that antihistamines are used in the prevention/treatment of allergic reactions, an antihistamine is not synonymous with anti-allergy drugs as there are drugs out there which treat allergies/inflammations which are not triggered by histamines, such as corticosteroids (antihistamines do not work on non-histamine allergies/inflammations). Silver allergies for example, is not a histamine allergy and is treated by corticosteroids.

You mentioned that you're taking levocetrizine, which targets H1 receptors. It would not be effective if you had allergies on H2-H3 or any other non-histamine allergy triggers. Mosquito bites, in particular the itching reaction, is strongly correlated to be affected by the activation of the H1 receptor. By taking levocetrizine, you've blocked the H1 receptor and thus, have suppressed the itch activation.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684411/

Thus, to answer your question, first of all, it would depend on which type of antihistamine you're taking (which type of histamine inhibition, from H1-H4) to see what other potential allergic/inflammatory reactions you're also suppressing). A H1 inhibitor antihistamine will not work on a H2-H4 histamine reaction or vice versa (it must be targeted). Secondly, antihistamines will only work on allergies/inflammations caused by histamines - it is not a cure-all for allergies as there are many different types of allergens (such as silver). Lastly, you are correct in identifying that taking an antihistamine for one allergen may reduce the effect of another potential allergen if they are both triggered via similar pathway. However, you should not preemptively self-medicate without proper medical guidance as each allergic reaction and subsequent treatment should be taken by a case by case basis. Also, taking antihistamines in the long-term can be detrimental to your health so please take care when you're using drugs and only use drugs in the manner prescribed."

AskScience,Is there actually important science done on the ISS/in LEO that cannot be done on Earth or in simulation?,"We've found a couple of manufacturing methods for special products that are easier in micro gravity, or even only possible at all up there.

Ones grown in space can be made with fewer defects or in different shapes."
AskScience,Why do sample return missions such as OSIRIS-REx use their own reentry vehicles instead of just going to the space station for pickup and return with ISS equipment?,"The main issue is that you would need to match the ISS orbit. 

A probe coming in from deep space will have a velocity of more than 11.5km/s. ISS orbits Earth at only around 7.5km/s. This means you need enough fuel to slow down by more than 4km/s (nearly 9000 mph!). This propellant would be way heavier than a heatshield. The few deep space missions that have brought things back have not bothered to slow down to orbital speed. They just slam into the atmosphere and let it do all the braking for free.

Heatshield are actually really convenient (if technically difficult to build) ways to slow down. Think of how big a rocket needs to lift something to orbit. If you did not have atmosphere to slow you down on you way back you would need nearly as big of a rocket to land."
AskScience,"Why is it that when our pupils dilate for reasons unrelated to the brightness of our environment (i.e., when we're attracted to someone) we don't seem to perceive a change in brightness in our vision?","one reason is that it's a small difference. the larger pupil dilation effects from sexual attraction (etc) are on the order of a 10% change in pupil area and thus in retinal illuminance. meanwhile, luminance discrimination thresholds are on the order of a few percent. so the change in retinal illuminance is, at most, just a bit more than you are minimally able to detect (meaning, it's perceptually pretty small).

also, the relation between increased illuminance and perceived brightness is already very compressive - for example if you increase the luminance of a target by 100%, it will only appear to be ~50% brighter. and this compression is greatly increased when you're talking about the entire scene/retina rather than a single target or object, because the retina as a whole has other gain control systems than just pupil diameter to more-or-less balance its sensitivity to current light conditions. (case in point: if you've ever had atropine put in your eyes to fully dilate your pupils, like at the eye doctor, you probably notice that everything is quite a bit brighter - but does it seem >20x brighter? Probably not, but that's about the degree of increased retinal illuminance.)

another reason is that the retina is mainly built for transmitting *contrast* information, not mean luminance. it does transmit some information about the overall brightness of a scene, but even this is only weakly correlated to physical luminance, and for the most part the retina is sending signals about *ratios* of brightness between nearby positions - and this signal is *independent of retinal illuminance* (given that there's enough light to have any signal at all). more light just makes the contrast signal clearer, but doesn't make it stronger.

so, while there probably is a perceptible effect of pupil change in these kinds of conditions (i can't find any studies where this is explicitly measured but they may exist), it's very small and probably masked by other much more significant content in the scene."
AskScience,How much carbon could be captured by restoring the topsoil in US farmland?,"Looking at just row crops, as that is perhaps the area with the best data and scale, commercial practices plus reduced tillage and cover cropping yield on average 0.5 ton of carbon per acre per year. 

Organic practices are at a much lower scale, but may yield 1.5-3.0 tons per acre (averaged across a rotation) depending on the specific approach to tillage, inputs, rotation, etc. As compelling as that number is, given that organic row crops are still <1% of available acreage, we can overlook it for now. 

There are about 316 million acres of row crops in the U.S. So, with a moderate, very achievable approach towards soil health, we can estimate about 158 million tons of carbon per year. 

However, if farmed to the highest environmental standards, that number shoots up to 948 million tons of carbon per year. 

That said, these yield estimates are still in their infancy. There’s literally no meaningful data to suggest what happens to carbon as soil biology increases over time, and my money is that is where the real yield is gained - perhaps because conventional agriculture kills off soil biology and organic systems just haven’t been studied enough at scale."

But, their lungs are huge, and they have a respiration rate 1/3 the speed of a human's, sucking as much oxygen out of their air as possible.

The host doesn't provide any DNA, but it is a critical and necessary part of successful reproduction for the wasps."
AskScience,"If radioactive elements decay over time, how is there any left after the 4.5 billion years?","Few different reasons:

1. Some have very long half-lives. E.g., [thorium-232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-232) has a half life of 14 billion years, so over 4.5 billion years, if you do the math, there's only been around a ~~9%~~ 19% (now with bonus correct math) reduction in the starting amount incorporated at the time of Earth's formation.

2. For some that have shorter half lives (but still relatively long), these were incorporated at high enough concentrations into the Earth at the time of formation that we still have measurable amounts left. A decent example of this is [uranium-235](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235), which has a half life of 703.8 million years. If you again do the math, that works out to ~~85%~~ ~98% reduction in the amount of U-235 compared to the formation of Earth (and we can see that reflected in things like the estimates of contribution of specific isotopes to the [internal heat budget of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget#/media/File:Evolution_of_Earth's_radiogenic_heat-with_total.svg)), but there's still enough that it represents around 0.7% of all Uranium (most by far is the much longer lived Uranium-238).

3. There are variety of ways shorter-lived isotopes can be produced and thus they still exist as their supply is constantly ""replenished"". Some are produced during [decay chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain) of other longer-lived radioactive isotopes. For example, in the decay chain of [U-238](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain#Uranium_series), U-234 (half life of ~245,000 years) and Th-230 (half life of ~75,000 years) are produced during the decay from U-238 to Pb-206. Others are generated by interaction with cosmic rays, forming  [cosmogenic isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide). Some longer lived examples of these are Be-10 (1.38 million year half life), Al-26 (717,000 year half life), Cl-36 (301,000 year half life), and C-14 (5,730 year half life), among others."
AskScience,Do you slow down in space?,"Once moving 20mph they will essentially continue to do so forever.

AskScience,why is gold so non-reactive despite not having full set of electrons in its outer electron shell like noble gases?,"The full outer shell rule as a predictor of reactivity is only really a rule of thumb for lighter elements.

Molecular orbital (MO) theory is a more thorough predictor of reactivity. Within MO theory framework, for a bond to form electrons need to be occupying bonding orbitals over anti-bonding orbitals. The more electrons in bonding orbitals the stronger the bond.

Electrons in metals form delocalised bands (continuum of states) with a defined Fermi energy. States below the Fermi energy are occupied. So if a reacting molecule forms combined orbitals with the metal bands, and these molecule + band states are below the Fermi energy, they are occupied.

Due to electron shielding as one moves across a period and electronic relativistic effects, the bands in gold are fairly low in energy below the Fermi energy. This causes the resultant anti-bonding orbitals formed with reacting molecules to be below the Fermi energy and thus occupied. This leads to weak or no bonding. See [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/376238a0) for more info."

AskScience,"What did Richard Feynman mean when he said ""turbulence is the most important unsolved problem of classical physics""?","Turbulence is hard to understand because its mathematical properties make it difficult to tackle. Not just analytically, but also computationally. 

1. Turbulence is inherently non-linear. In physics, many complicated phenomena are linear, meaning that individual modes can be analyzed in isolation. (As an example, ordinary beams of light in vacuum don’t interact with each other, they propagate on their own.) This nonlinear coupling means that different modes can exchange energy with each other through different length scales, such as via the inverse cascade. While you can make headway by analyzing the linear physics, it can only tell you so much. 

1. Turbulence is a non-equilibrium phenomenon. Here, equilibrium means that the system is in a steady-state. In physics, complicated systems can be still be understood in a statistical/thermodynamic sense if the system is in equilibrium. In contrast, turbulence is a far-from-equilibrium process with changing exchanges of momentum and energy, so these equilibrium methods don’t work. 

1. Turbulence is highly chaotic with many degrees of freedom. Conventional chaos theory works well with few degrees of freedom, so its applicability to turbulence is limited. (For an example where chaos theory is useful that isn’t just a particle trajectory, I believe stochastic magnetic fields are often analyzed with chaos theory methods.) I should note this does not mean the flow is completely *random*; you can have highly ordered statistical structures amidst the chaos. Probably the most prominent example is the polygon-shaped cyclone structure on the north pole of Jupiter. See also the formation of what are called zonal flows, the most prominent example being (again) Jupiter’s bands of color. 

1. Systems that exhibit turbulence are modeled by time-dependent non-linear partial differential equations. Simply put, non-linear partial differential equations are computationally costly and hard to simulate. Only a handful of analytic solutions exist for any given system, and only for very, very simple cases; oftentimes (maybe all the time?) these solutions characterize non-turbulent laminar flow. Because the system undergoes time evolution, the goal is not just “calculate a single number to high precision” like in other fields of physics. Rather, the problem is to determine how the whole system evolves in time and how to characterize and distill the time evolution of that system in a way we can understand.


The above features are generic and apply to systems beyond the Navier-Stokes equations. (For instance, kinetic systems can exhibit turbulence and don’t suffer from what’s known as the “closure problem”.)


Scientists consider it important because turbulence is present in many systems of interest. The solar wind, the Earth’s iron core, global climate, ocean currents, aerodynamics, weather on other planets, the list goes on. Some of these are also of practical interest. From a physics standpoint, I also find it novel that it’s a purely *classical* problem and is also an emergent phenomenon. Progress in things like quantum gravity research and fundamental theories will not help you better understand turbulence, you have to meet it on its own terms."

AskScience,"When a volcano erupts, does this affect the pressure building up in other volcanoes?","> When a volcano erupts, does this affect the pressure building up in other volcanoes?

Generally, no. At a simple level, any given volcano represents an isolated system, i.e., surface vents connected to a magma chamber within the crust, e.g., this [diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Tomas-Ovalle-2/publication/328102518/figure/fig4/AS:678366252376065@1538746526457/Proposed-genetic-model-for-the-El-Laco-iron-deposit-a-Formation-of-a-settled.jpg), while for a specific volcanic system is a decent generic representation to consider. If sufficient eruptable magma and conditions suitable for eruption exist (in terms of both volume of liquid, ratio of crystals to liquid, amount of dissolved gases, etc) within the magma chamber of a given system to cause an eruption, this will have no influence on other volcanoes because there is no connection between the systems. 

The caveat would be if you're considering separate (but nearby) volcanoes that represent different vents or components of the same system. An example might be something like the big island of Hawaii where Mauno Loa and Kilauea effectively represent different vents of a related system (e.g., [this super simplified diagram](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xsWTpE08qNM/WvGmzmGfHnI/AAAAAAAAP08/Byn5ty9IqO0DV5wooqp8rnEQ6RSw0SxfgCLcBGAs/s1600/Evolution%2Bof%2BMagma%2BChambers%2Bin%2BHawaiian%2BVolcanoes.jpg)). Here we can see that while the two volcanoes have their own magma chambers in the shallow crust, they are ""linked"" by a single magma reservoir in the deeper crust. In detail, it's long been noted that eruptions at the two tend to be anti-correlated, i.e., one erupts which reduces activity at the other and then they switch, which many have assumed is related to competition for magma supply from the deeper reservoir (e.g., [Klein, 1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0377027382900026)). Further, there are suggestions that the eruptive process of one of these volcanoes might temporarily inhibit activity of the neighboring volcanoes through changes in the stress state induced by the eruption (e.g., [Gonnermann et al., 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1612)). 

**In short,** the eruption of one volcano has no bearing on distant volcanoes as there is no connection between their magma sources and the other changes that result from an eruption (e.g., changes in stress state) have a very limited spatial range. In the specific case of volcanoes very close to each other and that may share some portions of a magma plumbing system, eruption through one vent may influence (and specifically decrease) the activity of adjacent vents, but if there is a large pulse of magma that enters into all of the vents, then this ""suppression"" may not occur."

AskScience,"If mRNA vaccines train your body to fight diseases, can it train your body to not fight certain things?","Yes, this is an active area of research and there are several promising studies. 

Without going into details, and oversimplifying wildly, the goal of allergy vaccines is to change the nature of an immune response to suppressive rather than inflammatory. (It’s often not understood that active immunity can be suppressive, turning off inflammatory responses.  There are large and highly active branches of the immune system devoted to this active suppression, which can be antigen-specific and non specific.)

Accordingly, in principle it’s possible to use a vaccine, delivered in the right way, to turn on the suppressive response to a particular antigen, which should shut off allergies. It’s tricky, because of course you want to avoid amplifying the ongoing inflammatory response, but it can be done.  

Since these are essentially vaccines, mRNA and DNA can be used to deliver them. For example:  

>	Allergen‐specific immunotherapy, which is performed by subcutaneous injection or sublingual application of allergen extracts, represents an effective treatment against type I allergic diseases. … Plasmid DNA and mRNA vaccines encoding allergens have been shown to induce T helper 1 as well as T regulatory responses, which modulate or counteract allergic T helper 2–biased reactions. … Due to inherent safety features, mRNA vaccines could be the candidates of choice for preventive allergy immunizations. The subtle priming of T helper 1 immunity induced by this vaccine type closely resembles responses of non‐allergic individuals and—by boosting via natural allergen exposure—could suffice for long‐term protection from type I allergy.

It can also be done as a preventive, in say children with the genetic tendency to develop allergies:

>	Our data clearly indicate that mRNA vaccination against Phl p 5 induces robust, long-lived memory responses, which can be recalled by allergen exposure without side effects. mRNA vaccines fulfill the requirements for safe prophylactic vaccination without the need for booster immunizations.

AskScience,Why do we use phase change refrigerants?,"Phase changes occur at fixed temperatures. When you introduce a saturated liquid in a heat exchanger and extract a saturated vapour from it, your temperature difference between the exchanger and your heat source has remained constant (assuming a sufficiently large source). Same goes for a saturated vapour entering a heat exchanger and leaving as a saturated liquid. This is more efficient than heating a vapour, as its temperature will increase, causing a smaller temperature difference between itself and its heat source/sink and with that a reduced heat flux. The latent heat of vaporisation for e.g. water is quite high, which means you can absorb or reject a lot of heat at a constant temperature.

This is readily apparent from the heat capacity of water vapour and the latent heat of vaporisation of water. The c_p of water vapour is roughly 1.8 or 1.9 kJ/(kg K) at 0 degrees Celsius. This means that adding 1.8 kJ to one kilogram of water vapour will raise its temperature one Kelvin. The latent heat of vaporisation for water at 0 degrees Celsius is about 2500 kJ/kg. Meaning one kilogram of saturated liquid water will absorb 2500 kJ before its temperature will start to rise.

So to answer your question more directly, yes, you can use a heat engine with only a gas as a working fluid, but phase transitions are an excellent way of absorbing or rejecting large amounts of heat quickly. An example of a real-world gas-only heat engine is the Stirling engine, which runs on the Stirling cycle."
AskScience,Does pet neutering affects hormones?,"Pet neutering has a huge effect on hormones. That is why almost all pet cats are neutered, both male and female. The hormonal behaviour of cats often includes a lot of loud yelling and marking the area with pee. (Depends on the individual, too.) Most people do not find these to be desirable features in a pet.

Neutering also makes them a lot more playful and sociable towards other cats. You could say they are more kitten-like.

It does often also make them much more likely to overeat. Unneutered cats are often kind of picky and slim, while with a neutered cat you often have to limit the amount of food they get."
AskScience,How do aquatic mammals deal with changing pressure on their ears?,"The reason it's a problem in humans is that we have small, collapsible eustachian tubes (the tubes that connect your inner ear to your mouth/atmosphere). 

Fish don't have the same kind of inner ear chamber that we do, so it's not an issue. 

Mammals like whales have, among other things, big, rigid eustachian valves so they don't have to ""pop"" them. 

The short version is that the human anatomy that makes it a problem doesn't quite exist in there animals."
AskScience,Why is person to person hair transplantation not possible?,"I really do hate to do this to you, but the popular image of organ transplantation is not what actually happens. It's not ""oh no, my lungs is die! I will get new lungs! Look, this mans - he has the blood type which also mine is! All is the good and my lungs they are new now! I am live forever!""

In the lead-up to a transplant HLAs/bloodtypes are scrutinized closely to *minimize the aggravation of the immune system*. You will be given a for-life course of immunosuppressant drugs that you will take until you die, to *slow* the process.

Despite our best efforts, and the constant striving of medicine, **the immune system will still, eventually, eat those organs.** Short of getting the organ from your identical twin, this cannot be prevented - there is no ""close enough"" match. We can only slow the process. Some organs (like kidneys) get 10+ years. Some (like lungs) get 3-5.

The kind of people who are getting a hair transplant aren't doing it because they need hair to live - this is a *vanity* transplant. Nobody is going to want a scalp that's red and inflamed and weeping fluids, and very few are going to be willing to give themselves chemically-induced AIDS because the alternative is *being bald.*

That's likely what Dr. Linkov meant."
AskScience,Why not use hydrogen and deuterium in fusion reaction rather than tritium and deuterium?,"Hey...finally something I can answer. I'm doing a PhD in Nuclear fusion materials. We ideally want to do the DT reaction due the fact it has the highest specific reactivity at lower temperatures even when compared to DD, DH etc reactions. It also produces a free neutron, which we can use for tritium breeding using a lithium breeder blanket, so the intent is we can produce self-sustaining tritium within the chamber."
AskScience,"What are more accepted hypotheses that similarly explain the aspects of hominid evolution that the ""pseudoscientific"" aquatic ape theory does?","Rather than cover what's already covered elsewhere, it's worth pointing out why the AAH fails:

* First, it considered traits ""piecemeal"", rather than looking at the organism as an integrated whole.  This allows it to engage in the common fallacy of ""remembering the hits and forgetting the misses"" - it points to things like the diving reflex or subcutaneous fat that are consistent with diving, but ""conveniently"" ignores traits completely inconsistent with aquatic life, such as lack of reflexive swimming (babies show a diving reflex, but cannot actively swim) or valvular nostrils.
* Second, it's completely at odds with comparative data.  Lots of mammals have become semiaquatic and aquatic, and none of them have done so in the manner postulated by AAH.  Nostril valves and webbed digits are near-universal in semiaquatic mammals, but absent in us, nothing else has become bipedal to move in water like AAH proposes.  There are even several monkeys which swim and dive on a VERY regular basis (Allen's Swamp Monkey, Japanese Macaque, Proboscis Monkey), and a) don't display anywhere near the strength of adaptations claimed by AAH and b) have the sort of adaptations you would expect from a typical swimming/diving mammal.
* Lastly, back when AAH was proposed, and when all the major books/articles/talks in favor of it came out, we knew almost nothing about our ancestors, particularly their habitats and ecology.  The Leakeys had only just begun their work, and wouldn't find Lucy until the 70's.

Getting dragged into the particulars of this or that trait is a mistake, operating on too low of a level.  Considring organisms are integrates wholes, and considering trait evolution in a comparative context, AAH makes not a damn bit of sense.

It's also why nearly nobody with a PhD in a relevant field takes it even remotely seriously, and the only exception was a plankton ecologist with no training in anthropology."
AskScience,What were dinosaur immune systems like? How were they different from animals today?,"Dinosaurs are of course alive today and have pretty great immune systems. Birds are modern dinosaurs and their immune systems are broadly very similar to mammalian immune systems, and work well.

(If you haven’t been paying attention to paleontology for the past 20 years, you may think that “birds are modern dinosaurs” is some well-actually technical truth that’s based on a quibble, like “well actually two sticks and a rock are technically a computer”. No.  In every sense birds *are* dinosaurs. Many dinosaurs would have looked like birds, albeit 20-foot-long birds with fangs, and there’s no reason to believe that modern dinosaur immunity is particularly different from that 100 million years ago.)

Birds, like mammals, have innate and adaptive immune system, with T and B cells in the adaptive response. B cells make antibodies that are very similar to mammalian antibodies, and antibodies are passed on to their offspring for temporary protection just as mammals pass on antibodies in their colostrum. There are a number of minor differences between the average bird and the average mammal, but most of those really are well-actually type differences - just because one class of bird antibodies is called “IgY” to mammalian “IgG” doesn’t make a functional difference. There are as many differences between mammal antibodies as between bird and mammals (see camelid antibodies, for example). 

We can also triangulate. Dinosaurs, mammals, and modern reptiles had common ancestors, so the features that mammals and modern reptiles (and modern dinosaurs) have in common were presumably present in ancient dinosaurs. Again, this includes virtually everything you’d find familiar in an immune system, including interferons an d other cytokines, the same categories of pattern-recognition molecules, the same structures for T and B cell receptors, and so on. Very broadly, immunity hasn’t changed very much since sharks invented T and B cells 400 million years ago. 

Of course the vast number of ancient dinosaurs, existing over a hundred million years, must have had variations in their immune system, as we see in the thousands of species of birds and mammals. But essentially, they would be just about the same."
AskScience,Why do some diseases cause a loss of appetite?,[removed]
AskScience,"are two puppies who are litter-mates more related to each other than to a puppy born in another litter, but to the same parents?","The puppies will have exactly the same genetic relatedness, but there is a chance they end up sightly more similar to one another than to a different litter based on the effects of non-genetic influences. For example, the environment and experiences they all share after birth during the critical socialization period, which might be different for each litter, and which can be profound in their effect on behavior in dogs. (One reason why cloning will never actually get your beloved pet back- you simply cannot duplicate all the variables even if the genes are identical.) Or before they’re born, the mother may experience some level of stress or illness that may prime the puppies to respond to stress slightly differently. Also, there’s a prevailing theory that mild illness in the pregnant mother dog, or unusually cold temperatures, can both contribute to slow melanocyte migration in the fetuses which is why some “solid colored” dogs are born with incidental tiny white snips on their toes, chins, tail tips, or the center of their chest or belly, as these are the last places those cells migrate during development, and this doesn’t seem to be heritable (though the tendency to be susceptible to this effect might be heritable, that doesn’t seem to be cleared up yet, and most heritable genes for white also follow a similar pattern of slowing melanocyte migration even in ideal conditions, which is why if a dog is going to have white it’s most likely going to be socks/ruff/blaze etc). In that case one litter of a certain purebred might have tiny show faults if the mom was going through it during her pregnancy, and another might not. But the actual genetic relationship between all the puppies would still be full brother and sister."
AskScience,Is our sleep pattern based off the length of the day?,"I hope someone can chime in if they know of any species of animals that historically hibernate during winter and become active during the summer in the Artic Circle where the sun does not set for weeks. Maybe an expert can also talk about nomadic cultures in a similar context. 

A quick tangent: there is a psych study where participants willingly were placed in an artificial residence (possibly in a building or underground) and left inside for months without the ability to tell what time of day it was from external stimuli. Basically, humans (and I would assume almost all animals) have an internal circadian clock that regulates bodily functions. For some odd reason, ours tends to run around 25 hours per day (not 24). 

Also, there are examples of cultures predominately taking naps or socializing at various times of day contrasted to other cultures e.g. Spain and Turkey. Old people start to sleep at odd hours and sometimes require less sleep too."
AskScience,There have been 95 earthquakes in the Mt. Lassen area of Northern California in the last 7 days. What is the likelihood that there will be an eruption of Mt. Lassen?,"> Could this be a lead up to Mt. Lassen erupting?

Almost certainly not. While certain types of earthquakes and other seismic events (e.g., [harmonic tremors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_tremor)) can definitely be indicative of magma moving (and thus be useful signals in concert with other measurements we makes as part of [volcanic monitoring](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/comprehensive-monitoring-provides-timely-warnings-volcano-reawakening)) and in turn warn of *possible* eruptions, importantly; (1) tectonic earthquakes and volcanic earthquakes are relatively easy to distinguish from each other and (2) in this case, all of the seismicity in question are [aftershocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock) from the clearly tectonic [M5.5 event](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73886731/executive) that occurred on May 11, 2023. 

While it's understandable that folks in the area are worried, especially given blatant clickbait articles floating around suggesting a possible link between these earthquakes and an eruption of Lassen (which I won't link to, since they're unfounded nonsense), this particular 5.5 event (and thus the aftershocks it has produced) is clearly tectonic as opposed to volcanic (e.g., [this brief statement from the USGS](https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/1656811704406122496?s=20)). While it's obviously too recent for there to be much in the way of published work, there's plenty of good information out there on the tectonic context of this event and similar events (e.g., the M5.7 event that happened on effectively the same fault system in 2013). For example [this visualization of the fault plane](https://twitter.com/ALomaxNet/status/1657764853505728516?s=20) or this [this write up and graphics](https://earthjay.com/?p=11082) from a geologist who works for the California Geological Survey."
AskScience,Are levels of self-esteem 'contagious' in group settings?,"External psychological forces have been known to be influential on others. Empathic neurology via mirror neurons can trigger endorphins (think babies when they see a person genuinely smile). Also, people's group think can be highly influenced by the ""hype"" of others. So i believe it is correct to say that groups can definitely influence the release of endorphins and hormones in others, but it's a double edged sword as endorphins and hormones such as oxytocin, while primarily thought of as promoting ""good feelings"" can also influence how we process negative emotions and have been shown to increase violence and antipathy when individuals are confronted with people considered ""outsiders"".

Edit: The original question was in regards to self esteem and i seem to have left that unaddressed. I think the feeling of strength in numbers as well as everything I posted previously can influence ones sense of self-esteem through endorphins, hormones, and a sense of belonging, but whether this translates into individual, self actualization within an individual that carries on after removing oneself from the group is not something i am aware of having been studied. Perhaps someone can research academic literature on the subject and find a research paper with more evidence. However anecdotally, i think you can view those who come from healthy and supportive families that encourage one another as a type of evidence to support this idea."
AskScience,Why gravity decreases with depth?,"It doesn't always, with reference to the Earth at least, it actually increases first and then begins to decrease. When considering gravity as a function of depth for the Earth, we often use the PREM (Preliminary Reference Earth Model), which suggests that gravitational acceleration actually increases until the core-mantle boundary, before starting to decrease, but not linearly, e.g., [this figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.jpg). 

The key concept here is the [shell theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem), which basically suggests that if you have a spherical object of radius X, at a depth Y, the gravitational acceleration will reflect only the influence of the mass of the object below depth Y (so effectively for a sphere of radius X-Y) because influence of the mass above depth Y is cancelled out. What begins to be important then is the distribution of mass, i.e., the density of the material within the sphere and how that's arranged. If the sphere had a constant density, then you would expect gravitational acceleration to uniformly decrease as a function of depth (and you can see this as one of the lines in the PREM figure from above). For Earth though, generally density increases with depth and does so very non-uniformly (e.g., [this model of density with depth, which is also part of PREM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#/media/File:RadialDensityPREM.jpg)).

If we put those two together, i.e., the shell theorem and the density changes with depth, what this implies is that as you get deeper, at first the increase in the average density of the shells ""below"" you compared to the average density of the shells ""above"" you results in an increase in gravitational acceleration. Once you get to the core-mantle boundary though, while density still increases with depth, it does so more consistently and over a narrower range (and you're broadly in the highest density portion of the planet) so now gravitational acceleration begins to decrease as there is less and less mass in the shells ""below"" you.

An obvious caveat is that PREM is a model (it's right there in the name) and assumes (1) the Earth is a perfect sphere (it's not, it's a lumpy oblate spheroid) and (2) density contrasts are perfectly radial (they're not, there are definitely contrasts in density within radial ""shells""), but it's a much better approximation than either assuming a constant density or something like a linear increase in density. Also, obviously this is the model for Earth. If we wanted to consider another planetary body, we'd have to update it to whatever the correct change in density with depth would be, but the shell theorem would still apply. If our hypothetical body was closer to a constant density, then you would expect generally gravitational acceleration to decrease with depth everywhere throughout it."
AskScience,"Why was ""making heavy water"" a mistake?","I haven’t seen the movie, so hopefully I’m not missing some key piece of narrative context here. But there’s nothing *inherently* wrong with using heavy water as a moderator for plutonium production. There are heavy water reactors in use today, and they work just fine.

But in, say, 1940, research into nuclear reactors was in its early stages, and scientists were still trying to figure out what materials would even work and what wouldn’t. Graphite (relatively cheap and easy to come by) was tested, but the French and Germans both found that graphite didn’t work in practice…it absorbed too many neutrons and “poisoned” the reaction. Heavy water worked, but it was very expensive and very hard to procure, so building working reactor piles with it would be slow and costly…but since graphite was out, the Germans resigned themselves to heavy water.

The American team figured out that the only problem with graphite was impurities…trace amounts of boron in “usual” graphite was responsible for the unwanted neutron absorption. By this point, however, the USA had put a stop to any new publication of nuclear scientific research, so there was no paper published that the German scientists could learn from. The Americans were able to produce purer graphite, still much cheaper and faster than acquiring heavy water, and so the Americans were able to set up nuclear piles and start experimenting with material while the German scientists were still struggling to pull together enough heavy water to get going. 

So, the “mistake” would have been not realizing on their own that graphite impurities were the issue, a mistake that (among many other hindrances) set the Germans even further behind the Manhattan project team."
AskScience,How does Mercury's orbit prove Einstein's theory of Gravitational Relativity?,"Prior to general relativity, gravity was understood using Newton's law of gravitation. Newton's laws let you predict the behaviour of two masses orbiting one other, like Mercury and the Sun, and for the simple case of two masses, where they're gravitationally bound to one another (i.e. when they're not moving faster than escape velocity), it predicts that the shape of the orbit will be an ellipse (or a circle, but an ellipse is a stretched circle so a circle is a kind of ellipse). If one body is much more massive than the other, like the Sun is compared to Mercury, then the heavier will essentially stay still and the other body will be the only one moving in an ellipse. In the ideal case, this ellipse stays where it is, and the lighter body goes around the heavier body on a path that meets up with itself after every orbit, so it's perfectly repeating.

However, you essentially never have the ideal case. Mercury isn't the only planet, and its motion is affected by the gravity of other planets. This is only a small effect, but generally speaking, when you apply a small perturbation like that to an elliptical orbit, it causes the ellipse to start rotating around, so that after each orbit it no longer meets up with itself, but is rotated slightly further around the heavier body. This is called precession. There are diagrams to this effect in the video.

Now, physicists at the time were able to work out how big the effect of the other planets was, and they found that, according to Newton's law of gravitation, it should precess by about 15% of a degree per century. That's not very much, it's about 1 degree every 700 years or a full rotation roughly every 250000 years. Still, astronomers had good enough telescopes that they were able to measure it, and they found that the rate of precession was about 16% of a degree per century, it was 1% of a degree too large. It's only a small error, but it was difficult to explain, because they were very confident in both their experimental measurements and their theoretical calculations.

At this point, Einstein comes along, with a new theory of gravity, general relativity. It's much more mathematically complicated than Newton's law, but physicists were able to use it to predict the behaviour of one small mass orbiting a much larger mass, the same setup that under Newton's law gave us the perfect repeating ellipse. When you use general relativity to solve the same problem, what you end up with is the same as with Newton's laws, plus a very small additional extra attractive force, and this extra force doesn't follow the same relationship between force and distance as Newtonian gravity (Newtonian gravity goes like 1/r^(2), but this new extra force goes like 1/r^(3)). This small extra force causes additional precession, on top of the precession caused by the other planets. When scientists plugged in the numbers for the Sun and Mercury, and worked out the size of this additional precession, they found that it almost exactly explained the missing 1% from the Newtonian prediction. Their experimental measurements were right all along, and it was their theoretical prediction that was wrong, not because they'd done the calculations wrong, but because the theory itself wasn't quite accurate. As a result of this, as well as a few other tests, general relativity supplanted Newton's law of gravity as our most accurate theory of gravitation."

This from a primary journal article: Journal of clinical microbiology 32 (2), 571-574, 1994
Cell-free and cell-associated human immunodeficiency virus cultures suspended in 10% serum remained infectious for several weeks at room temperature. The stability was further increased when cell-associated virus was suspended in neat serum. When dried onto a glass coverslip, virus remained infectious for several days, although cell-associated virus lost infectivity more rapidly than cell-free virus.

Happily-no evidence of transmission via a surface in non-healthcare related situations has been shown.  A few cases of “mystery” transmission in healthcare settings were noted.  Don’t forget-the dried material would have to contact mucosal membranes, open wounds, or genital mucosal linings if sufficient amount to causes infection.

Hope this helps."
AskScience,How does high humidity affect perceived temperature in hot and cold environments?,"~~In cold weather our bodies lose heat mainly by conducting heat directly to the air. Moist air is a better conductor than dry air, so moist cold air feels colder.~~

In warm weather, we mainly cool ourselves by sweating. The sweat evaporates, which is an endothermic reaction which takes heat out of your body. When the air is already saturated there's little evaporation, so this process stops working. So moist hot air feels hotter.

~~So humidity makes extremes of temperature more extreme - hot gets hotter, cold gets colder.~~


(edit) People have pointed out a mistake. The humidity of cold air is always low. The difference in conductivity between cold air of high relative humidity vs cold air of low relative humidity is negligible, as displayed in this graph.
 https://www.electronics-cooling.com/2003/11/the-thermal-conductivity-of-moist-air/

Some people are sharing anecdotes that they feel much colder in more humid weather - I think that's more to do with moisture on your body than moisture in the air.



(edit) Some people want to note the detail that evaporation is a phase change, not a chemical reaction.

As you add heat energy to water, its temperature increases linearly until it gets to about 100 degrees C. From here it takes in additional energy, but its temperature doesn't rise - this energy is instead used to break its bonds to complete the phase change from liquid into gas. Once the phase change is complete and it has become a gas, you see a linear relationship between heat and temperature once again.

So what's happening is you're transferring your body heat into the sweat, which is evaporating and carrying that energy away.

AskScience,When alcohol degreases something where does the oil go?,"In short - Alcohols are Amphiphilic; meaning that it can bind with both polar and non-polar things.  In a polar bond, one atom is positively charged and the other is negatively charged. A molecule (or a polyatomic ion) is polar when one side of the molecule is more positive (or more negative) than the other. This makes it perfet to work with fats, since they are non-polar.

So when you start cleaning with alcohol, because of it's Amphiphilic properties, it gets mixed well between the long fatty acid chains (what grease is made out of) and sticks with it. This basically dissolves the packed ""chains"", by getting in between the fatty molecules, which is then washed away by the alcohol/cloth/other cleaning agent."

A tsunami wouldn't *permanently* flood an area unless it was already a basin, or unless the tsunami did some kind of severe secondary damage (e.g., breaking open a natural dam and releasing or redirecting a bunch of other water).

Some cursory research says that we think Doggerland - and anyone living there - was greatly affected by a tsunami but was already dealing with rising sea levels, and *more* rising sea levels are what finally buried it beneath the waves. The tsunami was just a bad time for anyone still living on the land that was left.

Beta blockers do reduce cardiac output, but not close to any degree that would compromise flow to an organ system like the GI tract. Not to mention that the stomach, although vascular like you mentioned, does not really perform a lot of absorption of nutrients. This occurs mostly in the small intestine where the blood supply is essential to take nutrients to the portal system."
AskScience,Can the Earthquake in Turkey lead to more in different areas from aftershocks?,"Ok, so there are two things to talk about here, specifically **aftershock sequences** and **triggering**. 

For **aftershocks**, large earthquakes will basically always be followed by a sequence of [aftershocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock). There are a variety of properties for these: 

1. They occur in a region immediately adjacent to the extent of the rupture, default assumption is a region within the length of the rupture extending away from the rupture (i.e., if the rupture was 50 km long, you could reasonably expect aftershocks in directions 50 km away both in an orthogonal sense but also from the tips of the rupture in a parallel sense). 
2. By definition, they are smaller than the main shock. If an earthquake occurs in the aftershock sequence that exceeds the magnitude of the original main shock, this new earthquake becomes the main shock and the original is  re-designated as a foreshock.
3. The largest aftershock tends to be ~1 magnitude less than the main shock (i.e., [Båth's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock#B%C3%A5th's_law)).
4. The number of aftershocks decays through time following the main shock (i.e., [Omori's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock#Omori's_law)), meaning that the time immediately after the main shock is when you will see the most aftershocks.

With above, generally the majority of Lebanon would be outside the areas you'd typically expect aftershocks, but it's important to remember these are general relationships and every earthquake is a little different. 

The separate detail that underlies your question has less to do with aftershocks and more to do with what geologists/seismologists refer to as **triggering**. Basically, the extent to which a given earthquake can trigger an earthquake on another fault that is outside the area we'd consider an aftershock or of a magnitude we wouldn't associate with aftershocks. In detail, there are two kinds of triggering, *static* triggering and *dynamic* triggering. If you want a deeper dive on the difference, we have [an FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_trigger/) on this topic. In short though:

1. Static triggering refers to an earthquake induced on a fault that is nearby as a result of static (i.e., permanent) stress changes that result from deformation that occurred during the original earthquake. 
2. In contrast, dynamic triggering is the triggering of a fault from dynamic (i.e., temporary) changes in stress that results from the passing of seismic waves from a given earthquake. 

For either type of triggering to happen, a fault needs to be near failure. Crucial differences between these two types of triggering relate to both distance and time. For static triggering, this will be restricted to areas relatively close to the original rupture (largely in a similar region where you'd expect aftershocks, but the extent of these two zones are not always the same) but could occur either quickly or years later. For dynamic triggering, this could theoretically influence any fault, anywhere, but is restricted to a relatively narrow time window around the original earthquake event (since the stress changes are temporary). 

In terms of the Turkey earthquake, we've already seen what is likely a static triggered event, specifically the second ~M7.5 earthquake that occurred a few hours after the main event on a secondary fault. This [preliminary write up](https://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/turkey-syria-earthquake-feb-6-2023-14918/), and specifically this [graphic](https://static.temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230206_Turkey.jpg) shows the result of the [Coulomb stress transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_stress_transfer) from the original M7.8 event. The way to read this is that red/yellow areas experienced a permanent increase in stress as the result of the earthquake whereas areas in blue experienced a decrease in stress. If you look at this image, you'll notice there is a band of orange/red stress increase illuminating the location of the later M7.5 (i.e., [this event](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000jlqa/executive)), suggesting that this second event is in part the result of static triggering (note this is all preliminary, so later work will likely consider this in more detail). Of note for the original question, you'll also notice that the static stress change does not reach as far south as Lebanon generally, so one would not expect a statically triggered event related to the Turkey sequence. 

So what about dynamic triggering? This more of a wildcard, but the short version (which you can again look more into in the FAQ) is that dynamically triggered events are rare (to the point where its actually relatively hard to demonstrate that it occurs) and the possibility of a dynamically triggered event decays with time since the main event. 

**In summary:** For the specific question, in general we would not expect significant number of aftershocks or static triggering mechanisms related to this sequence of earthquakes in Turkey to be a significant risk for areas further south along the Dead Sea fault zone like Lebanon. Dynamic triggering is harder to consider, but these are exceedingly rare in general. The big caveats with all of this is that there are few certainties with these type of details (and you're close enough that there *might be some* local effects), but more importantly, your country has its own seismically active major strike slip fault (i.e., the Dead Sea fault) and there is pretty much always a background risk of significant seismic hazard (just as there was for the area of the East Anatolian fault zone that failed, producing the set of earthquakes we're talking about). That is to say, a decent level of caution and awareness is pretty much always warranted in that location, but in all likelihood, much of the concern of something directly related to the Turkey earthquakes is not warranted."
AskScience,When did tarantulas lose the ability to produce silk / weave webs?,I have several pet tarantulas and they all have spinnerets and the ability to make silk and webs. Some species like my Gooty Sapphire are arboreal and don’t make much webbing. Others like my Green Bottle Blue tarantula are terrestrial and make extensive webbing and pretty cool burrows that are built with so much silk the walls are white.
AskScience,"What happens when two separate earthquakes occur simultaneously far enough apart, but close enough to a point that would feel both at the same time?","Are you asking if seismic waves can interfere with each other (in a [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference) sense)? Then, yes. While I'm not sure if there's a great reference for your specific question, there are plenty of references out there considering the interference of seismic waves, e.g., what is observed at the antipode (i.e., exact other side of the globe) of a given earthquake (e.g., [Rial & Corner, 1980](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB085iB05p02661)) or scenarios where different types of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave) from the same event interfere with each other (e.g., [Zhao et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926985110000601), [Shani-Kadmiel et al., 2012](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/102/4/1729/325455/Simulation-of-Seismic-Wave-Propagation-through)). For a hypothetical with two distinct sets of seismic waves from two different events interacting, the result will depend on the details of the waves, i.e., there might be constructive interference (i.e., the amplitude of the waves are enhanced) or destructive interference (i.e., the amplitude of the waves are diminished) depending on the offset in phase, amplitude, etc. Similarly, there would likely be complicated patterns as different types of seismic waves interact, e.g., the p-wave from one event interacting with the s-wave from another, and so on, as we see in terms of interference within suites of waves generated by single events (see the Zhao and Shani-Kadmiel papers referenced above). Given that, I would guess that there would be both constructive and destructive interference and that this would probably vary with time as the two sets of waves passed each other at a given point."
AskScience,Why have box jellyfish evolved beyond other jellyfish to be the most venomous animals on the planet?,"I don't know about jellyfish specifically, but venomous is not a linear scale, it depends both on the venom and the victim. So while ""most venomous to humans"" is a fairly solid concept, ""most venomous"" without that ""to humans"" caveat is not really a thing.

It's quite possible that the jellyfish's natural prey are relatively resistant to whatever is in it's venom and it just kinda by fluke happens to be really bad news for humans.

Funnel web spiders are arguably the most venomous spiders to humans but relatively harmless to cats, dogs and birds.

But killing people is not what their venom is evolved for, that's just an accident, they are actually after insects and small lizards."
AskScience,If something is at absolute 0° (0K) then would it not have any pressure?,"In the context of the ideal gas law yes the pressure would be zero at absolute zero. 

The thinking is: Ignoring particle interactions and finite volumes, at absolute zero the molecules/ atoms would have zero velocity. Thus there would be no collisions with the walls of your container and no pressure.

In reality, materials don’t follow the ideal gas law in particular due to intermolecular interactions (and QM). The descriptions of “temperature” and “pressure” and how they’re related will be different to the ideal gas law."
AskScience,Why does temperature determine the sex of certain egg laying animals like crocodiles?,"Temperature affects the rate of chemical reactions.

Complex biological pathways result in more or less of particular hormones being produced at different temperatures. This is useful in cold-blooded organisms, because if the chemistry of some biological function tends to shut down beyond a particular temperature threshold, the organism can incorporate other biological systems that kick in to replace it.

The advantage of having offspring's sex affected in such a way is open to discussion."
AskScience,"Is any ""movement"" visible in the fluctuations of the CMB over time, or does it appear static?","While movement is expected in principle, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is static over human time scales.

The light comprising the CMB last scattered at the same time everywhere, when the universe was about 370000 years old. The CMB that we see consists of the light that is just now reaching us. As time goes on, light from more and more distant regions is able to reach us. In this way, the CMB depicts a spherical slice of the 370000-year-old universe (the ""last scattering surface"") at an ever increasing distance as time goes on.

Over what time scale should we expect to see the CMB change, then? The smallest scales we can resolve, currently, are about 0.07 degrees on the sky, which corresponds to about 50000 light years (15 kpc) at the distance of the CMB. (This is actually remarkably small due to the [angular diameter turnover](https://xkcd.com/2622/)!)

For a 50000-light-year structure, light from the far end takes 50000 years longer to reach us than light from the near end. Does this mean that we should expect CMB temperature fluctuations on those scales to change in about 50000 years? Well not quite. The CMB is redshifted by a factor of 1100, which means it's time dilated by the same factor. So we expect fluctuations on the (currently) smallest resolved scales to change over a (1100 times longer) time scale of about **55 million years**."
AskScience,Why isn't the Oort Cloud planar?,"The Oort Cloud is so far out that the Sun's gravity is extremely weak and the orbital velocities of objects are extremely slow (by orbital standards, anyway). This means that objects in the Oort Cloud can be easily perturbed by the gravity of nearby stars, and even tidal forces from the Milky Way itself. This keeps the orbits of bodies in the Oort Cloud from settling into a single plane.

It's hypothesised that there's another belt on the interior of the Oort Cloud, called the Hills Cloud. If this exists, it's thought to be much more planar."
AskScience,What are the forces on Earth’s Inner Core that change its speed?,"Lorentz forces, that is, forces due to the induced magnetic field of the outer cores geodynamo. I believe this is one of if not the leading mechanism proposed to explain this. Another mechanism would be angular momentum transport by thermal convection in the inner core. However, it is thought that the thermal conductivity within the inner core is too large and so the inner core is stably stratified (no convection and hence no radial transport of angular momentum).

Edit - I have been made aware of a rather amusing debacle in the reporting of a recent paper that is causing a lot of confusion. When I answered the question only the title was showing so my answer was very general to what we know of the inner core and its super rotation (although I did neglect the gravitational coupling between the departure of sphericity of the inner core and the mantle).

AskScience,Where does all of the snot come from when you have a cold?,">  or do you have like a secret mucus receptical that just decides to empty into your sinuses?

Mucus is a compound built from a small amount of specific proteins (mucins) and a lot of water.

So ""all the snot"" mostly comes from the water in your body, the gelling agent can be produced in pretty small quantities by mucous membranes, specifically the [nasal mucosa](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020545), and even more specifically the [goblet cells](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020397) of the nasal mucosa. The nasal mucosa produces small quantities of mucin on a permanent basis (like other mucous membranes) in order to protect itself, trap debris, and move things along, but when you suffer from an infection of the nose one of its (possible) reaction is to ramp up mucin production, leading to significant amounts of mucus.

Hagfishes are a good way to demonstrate how fast and how much mucus can be produced as they use it as a defense mecanism (their body is lined with mucin glands, and when threatened they start releasing it in the environment, which is water): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5PGZRxhAyU

An other (maybe somewhat less gross) example is making jellies (as in gelatin desserts not fruit preserves). ""Standard firmness"" for gelatin products is apparently 1/4 ounces (30g) gelatin to 2 cups  (472mL = 472g) water. That's a 15:1 ratio of water to gelatin by mass[0], and that sets *hard*, it's not runny like mucus is.

[0]: note that ""ready"" flavoured gelatins (e.g. your jello) will have a much lower ratio, because the powder contains sugar and flavorants, not just gelatin"
AskScience,What exactly is going on when a protein (or other molecule) binds with a receptor?,"Receptors are proteins, which are made up of amino acids that fold into a particular 3-dimensional shape. Different amino acids can also have different properties such as positive and negative charges, hydrophobic or hydrophilic side chains, etc.

Receptors can also be modified with sugars, lipids, etc. but the ligand binding site is usually just amino acids.

When a ligand (protein or other molecule) binds to the receptor, it will interact with the amino acids in the binding site, based on their 3D shape and physical properties (charge, hydrogen bonding, etc.) The binding affinity of the ligand will depend on how strongly it interacts with the binding site. This is how the receptors establish selectivity for binding some molecules instead of others.

You can think of the binding event like a hand fitting into a glove. The glove will change shape a bit when the hand goes into it. This conformational change in the receptor can cause downstream biological effects, depending on the function of the receptor. Many receptors are kinases which phosphorylate proteins when the ligand is bound.

Also, some inhibitors (called competitive inhibitors) will bind to the receptor and not cause conformational changes like the normal ligand, but still occupy the binding site.

Regarding the question of rigidity/solidity, proteins can be more or less flexible (depending on the protein) but the individual bonds are pretty rigid, and most receptors will have only a few stable conformations."

AskScience,"Sun exposure - 30 minutes straight under the sun versus 10 minutes under the sun but done 3 times. What is the difference, if there is one?","Spread out exposures are better.

DNA damage is constantly being repaired.

We have multiple mechanisms to repair this damage. For illustration, let's say you have 3 repair mechanisms, and it takes 10 minutes to repair damage to any one of them.

Scenario 1.

You spend 10 mins in the sun, which damages repair mechanism A. You stop under a tree for 10 minutes. Mechanisms B and C fix mechanism A. You continue, until you've been out for a total of 2 hours. End of the day, the mechanisms managed to repair each other, because there was always a backup repair mechanism.

Scenario 2.

You spend 2 hours straight in the sun. All 3 repair mechanisms have been damaged by the UV radiation. You don't have any more repair mechanisms left, but the body still remembers to kill off these damaged cells, resulting in a nasty sloughing sunburn.

Scenario 3.

You spend 2 hours straight in the sun. All 3 repair mechanisms are damaged. The cell-suicide (apoptosis) mechanism is also damaged. Some damaged cells survive and become cancer.

This is the multiple-hit hypothesis of cancer. You can take damage in many places, but if you accumulate damage to all of the repair mechanisms simultaneously, that's when cancer happens. I can't say how much of a difference a couple minutes of breaks will make, but it will probably be better than taking all of the damage continuously.

Think, what's worse, 8 drinks in 3 hours, or 8 drinks in 30 minutes? Total amount of alcohol is the same, but there's a difference.

Edit to add: Way way better than spreading out exposure, is to avoid UV exposure in the first place. Not all DNA damage can be repaired. Exposure to UV radiation always increases your cancer risk. Wear sunscreen or other types of UV mitigation."
AskScience,"Why does alcohol kill bacteria, but not the cells that our bodies are composed of?","It *does* kill cells in our body to some extent, like high concentration ethyl alcohol (like 90% or higher) can cause mild chemical burns in your mouth if you drink it neat. Not to mention the scarring of the liver (although tbf that’s more because of acetaldehyde, the *fairly* heavily toxic chemical ethanol gets mostly metabolized into).

This being said, it mostly is just a difference of scale; we not only have way more cells in our bodies, but eukaryotic cells are many times larger than (most) bacteria (this obviously varies a lot, but generally it is the case), so they’re far more vulnerable to damage or death by chemical means unless they’re specifically adapted against it.

But I guarantee you, if you somehow exposed every cell in your body at once to a high volume of 99% ethanol, you would not survive it either. The outer membranes of our cells are mostly just a thin film of lipids which organic solvents like ethanol can dissolve, and we don’t even have cell walls like bacteria do to add an extra layer of protection, it’s just that we normally only come into contact with alcohol in comparatively small amounts in a diluted form.

EDIT: also, should probably be mentioned, mouthwash usually does contain other antibacterial ingredients besides just ethanol, and if you just used, say, vodka as mouthwash, it would likely kill *some* bacteria in your mouth but overall not be nearly as effective (plus everyone would think you were a drunk)."
AskScience,"I've seen people pushing the alkaline water BS lately, but it's got me thinking: what's the highest pH that's safe to drink?","You can get a lot of answers about the chemistry side here. Practically there will be a pH (hard to test for as you can imagine) that will burn your esophagus and melt it and you will die a gruesome death. Some people choose to commit suicide this way.

Below that pH you will get esophagus and sever (chemical) burns that make you wish you were dead. If you survive you will have horrible adhesions and strictures for the rest of your life and it will predispose you to esophageal cancer.

Below these pHs, you arelooking at neutralization of your gastric acid, which can lead to terrible infections. And if done consistently it changes your bloodstream pH and can cause some kidney issues with stone formation in the predisposed population.

Last but not least, below all that, probably not too much cuz it is a BS hype. Your kidneys and respiratory system keep tight control over your bloodstream pH. So these people give themselves minor indigestion for no real reason. And someone makes a lot of money off them."
AskScience,Why is the concept of arrow of time apparently contradictory with Newtonian physics ?,"Entropy and Enthalpy are connected in your example. As was mentioned there is heat loss, etc.

The issue you raise is more intuitively understood in simple systems. Think of a system of three billiard balls bouncing around a table. For a short clip, it's not obvious if the video is being played forward or backward. The balls collide and rebound based on simple forces and there is no arrow of time in evidence except in their slowing down due to friction. 

Scale this up to a larger system where the atoms behave classically like the billard balls and you have the basic conundrum. Even dissipative forces are classically just forces on the balls and have no inherent ""direction"" at the simplest level. In the aggregate, however, Entropy enters the picture and the system tends toward disorder. 

In classical physics this is a manifestation of large probabilities, and not a fundamental force or ""arrow of time"" that drives the system. Hence, at a fundamental level, the system is theoretically reversible and time's arrow is just a probabilistic manifestation of large numbers. In theory, pockets of the universe could, at times, run against the arrow by sheer ""luck,"" though the numbers involved make this unlikely at any macro scale.

That's more or less what is being talked about regarding classical physics and the lack of a universal time direction or discrimination."

AskScience,Why is the sky blue? Do I understand it correctly:,"Yes, I believe you're mostly right. This is all described via [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering), which states that the amount of scattering light undergoes is inversely proportional to it's wavelength (actually, to its wavelength to the fourth power, so a very strong connection) (and to answer your last question, yes, you can talk about frequency or wavelength of light. They are bound together by the equation (frequency)\*(wavelength) = (speed of light)). 

So, coming from the sun is white light. The high frequency/small wavelength light (like blue) is more likely to get scattered. Thus, the blue light gets bounced all around, making the whole sky seem blue. 

Since most of the blue light gets scattered, what is remaining is the other colors. At sunrise/sunset, the light from the Sun is passing through more atmosphere, so the longer wavelength light (like red) has more time to scatter"

You can also hear sounds change pitch as you move towards or away from them.

Imagine these same principles applying to different positions in orbit around the Sun throughout the year, type 1A supernovae, and red / blue shift of light, and you can begin to map images of stars and galaxies pretty well.

We can see that we are in a spiral shaped galaxy, and that we are not in a globular galaxy. Our spiral galaxy has arms with varying density, and we can also determine that we are in an area that is relatively less dense, meaning that we are between arms. We also can look towards the center of our galaxy and measure our distance from the middle"
AskScience,How do modern navigation aids account for irregularities in the shape of Earth?,"> Don’t these presuppose a perfect globe

No, they do not. For horizontal coordinates, modern coordinate systems approximate the shape of the Earth as an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid), which we refer to as a [reference ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid#Reference_ellipsoid). A given reference ellipsoid can be defined with a length of the semi-major axis (i.e., the equatorial radius), the semi-minor axis (i.e., the polar radius), and the flattening, though in practice you only need two of these quantities to define the ellipsoid shape and the most common to report are the semi-major axis and the flattening (or its inverse).

> how do they deal with the major irregularities in the shape of Earth?

Let's consider a [geographic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) (as opposed to a [projected coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projected_coordinate_system)), and specifically [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS_84), which is the most recent version of the ""World Geodetic System"" and one of the more common sets of geographic coordinate systems you'd be likely to encounter. WGS84 is one version of a [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum), basically the shape of the oblate spheroid that is used to approximate the shape of the Earth. Chances are if coordinates are reported in latitude and longitude, these are given in WGS84, though not always, for example if you're using a topographic map in the US, it might be in NAD83 (a different geodetic datum)  though these two should give relatively similar coordinates, but other geodetic datums can be quite different depending on the values they use for the properties of the ellipsoid, i.e., semi-major axis, flattening. The differences in these parameters can reflect more accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth (e.g., the differences between WGS84 and the earlier versions like WGS60, etc), or if we are considering a ""local datum"", it may use a semi-major axis and flattening that better approximates the shape of the Earth for the region for which the datum is defined, but is worse if you were to use it for the entire planet.

Thus, while we think of latitude and longitude as angular measurements on the surface of a sphere (e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#/media/File:Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg)), in reality (at least for modern uses of these), they are angular measurements on the surface of an ellipsoid / oblate spheroid. This is why the meridian distance (in km, but you could do it miles, etc) between degrees of latitude actually change as a function of latitude (e.g., the [table and/or formula for WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#Meridian_distance_on_the_ellipsoid) here). If we approximated the Earth as sphere for these coordinates (as we did before we had accurate measurements of the ""figure of the Earth""), the meridian distance for latitude would be constant (but it would still change for longitude, going from a maximum at the equator to zero at the poles). 

Finally, all of the above has been concerned with the horizontal datum (i.e., latitude and longitude), but to uniquely define a coordinate, we also need to consider the vertical position, and thus the vertical datum that is used. Here, most modern coordinate systems do not use the ellipsoid to reference the elevation of a point, but instead use the vertical position relative to the [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid), i.e., what the surface of a global ocean would be accounting for mass differences and rotation, but ignoring winds, currents, and tides, etc. In some very specific circumstances, an ellipsoidal vertical datum might be used (i.e., referencing elevations with respect to the surface of the ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth), but generally, if you are given a latitude, longitude, and elevation for a point, the latitude and longitude will be with reference to a specific ellipsoid (i.e., the horizontal datum) and the elevation will be with reference to a specific geoid (i.e., the vertical datum)."
AskScience,Light traveling through a medium that slows it. Does the same photon emerge?,"So, first answering your main question- elementary particles are all fungible. That means, they are truly identical, and they are impossible to label. So, if a photon is absorbed and then remitted, it doesn't really make sense to say ""is it the same photon or a different one?"" There aren't really ""same"" or ""different"" photons, there's just photons, unlabeled. 

And it's not just photons. Any time you have a particle collision which results in some different elementary particles (like the ones from particle accelerators), if one of the products and reactants are the same elementary particle, you can't answer ""is this the same or a different particle?"" It's a particle. That's all you can say. 

Now, to get into the can of worms you opened, and probably didn't even know it. It is this line:

> It is my understanding that the light is slowed through the medium because photons are absorbed and then re-emitted repeatedly. 

I always say, if you want to get some physicists to fight, ask them why light propagates slower through a non-vacuum. You'll get a different answer from each one, and they will pretty aggressively defend their position and discount the others. I always find it fascinating, because it seems like a pretty simple question (why does light travel slower in a non-vacuum?) but the answer is quite complex, and our models for it all work, but tell slightly different stories. 

The easiest to understand model is the one you mentioned- and it does work. The most common complaint is that an atom can only absorb very specific wavelengths, but light of all wavelengths is slowed down by materials. But, this is handled by understanding that collections of particles will have nearly an infinite number of modes of excitation- you can cause groups of particles to vibrate or rotate, you can cause vibrations between groups of 2 particles, or groups of 3 (or 4, or 5....). There's a ton of different excitation modes, and for a dense medium, you can absorb and re-emit any wavelength of light. 

Other people will express a model where light actually takes many paths through the medium, and that superposition actually results in it appearing as if the light is traveling under 'c'. Still others will talk about how photons become a quasiparticle when in a dense medium, and that particle doesn't travel at 'c'. And I'm sure there are others out there. All of these explanations ""work"" and I won't say one is right over the other."
AskScience,Why does a french horn need valves?,"The way brass instruments work, is there are certain frequencies they are resonant with. This depends on the size and shape of the horn. You can ""lip up/down"" to bend notes, or get sounds close to whats resonant, but they tend not not come out quite as clearly as on-pitch tones. 

The valves change the shape/length of the horn, which changes the resonant frequencies, aka the notes the horn produces. This is all the same with trumpets or any valved instrument.

To see why, lets consider how sound works (note: most of this also applies to images/video). Sound is transferred through air through vibrations. A vibrating membrane in a speaker pushes the air and the pattern of these movements is registered by our ears.

As long as we have something to drive the vibration of this membrane (that is: As long as we can power a speaker), we can keep producing sound. It doesn't ""run out"".

In addition, even the most complex symphony is a composition of simple sound waves. With a complex sound, the speaker has to vibrate in a more complicated pattern, but it's still just a membrane being moved back and forth in some way.

Now lets look (or sniff?) at smells. We smell things because certain molecules enter our nose and trigger a response there. Different molecules trigger a different response. But unlike sound (or images), there is no basic element that can be used to create all (or even most) possible scents. To properly reproduce some perfume, your smell-device will have to contain the substances used in the perfume. It'll need the components of a fart, the substances that give all kinds of foods their smells, parts of various flowers and the list goes on. Some of these substances might not have a long shelf life when isolated from where they normally are. And no matter how extensive you make the array of substances stored in your scent-speaker, there'll always be some new or unusual smell that it does not have available.

And while sound, being just the movement of air, doesn't expend anything, sending some substances into the air to reproduce a scent uses up this substance. That means that a scent-speaker will need to be refilled regularly.

So you're looking at needing a large number of substances to reproduce the scents, some of which may not last for long and all of which will need to be replaced when they run out. This makes managing ink cartridges seem downright fun by comparison.

And finally, when you turn off a sound producing device or a display, the sound or the image are gone. When your scent-speaker has filled the air with some abyssal mixture of unpleasantness, it's going to linger even after you turn the device off.

There have been some scent-producing devices made as prototypes or gimmicks ([example](https://hapticsol.com/cilia/cilia-acvr) with only 6 different scents), the concept is too impractical for mass use."

In their case, this was a mating call…and the point of a mating call is not just to sound attractive but also to differentiate yourself from other species (so you attract a mate of the *same* species as you). If other birds with a similar call show up, individual birds will adjust their calls enough to stand out, in ways that are measurably different from their dads’ calls. 

More broadly, we see bird calls changing across geography just like human language does…[bird populations that are a little ways apart have slightly different calls](https://royalsociety.org/blog/2021/11/how-do%20bird-songs-evolve-over-time/#:~:text=Like%20human%20language%2C%20bird%20song,from%20one%20city%20to%20another.).

AskScience,Has any research been done on the impact of atmospheric pressure on seismic activity?,"> Has any research been done on the impact of atmospheric pressure on seismic activity?

Yes, this is a question that geologists/seismologists have considered for a long time (e.g., [Landsberg, 1940](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/TR021i002p00227)).

> My reasoning is that if the earth's surface/crust experiences less pressure due to changes in atmospheric pressure, then maybe seismic movement can occur easier than usual.

So broadly, the underlying logic is sound, i.e., anything that can change the stress state in the crust can *potentially* change some details of the statistics of earthquakes making a given event that is near failure either more or less likely to occur depending on the nature of the change in stress state. In terms of surface influences, the most common consideration is that some processes that reduces mass above a fault (e.g., less surface water) effectively reduces the normal stress on the fault and means that the shear stress required for the fault to slip is less (i.e., it's an easier for an earthquake to occur), but there are other mechanisms by which these surface changes can potentially influence fault and earthquake behavior. In detail, a variety of surface details, mostly related to hydrologic changes (e.g., changes in groundwater, changes in snow mass, changes in precipitation, etc) have been suggested to modulate the detailed statistics of earthquakes (e.g., consider the discussions and linked papers in these two FAQs, [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_seasons/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/climate_change_earthquakes/)). 

Now, the trick with barometric pressure changes potentially working in this way is that these tend to be *very small* compared to things like changes in water mass. Per the Landsberg reference, they've been considered, but even in that review, it was generally assumed that they were not of sufficient magnitude to actually do much. There have been occasional suggestions that barometric pressure changes could influence subtle statistics of earthquake sequences, like those observed in the sequence following the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (e.g., [Gao et al., 2000](https://www.nature.com/articles/35020045)), but subsequent work has shown that these are likely better explained by seasonal variation in hydrology (e.g., [Johnson et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aak9547)). Similarly, there was a lot of buzz around the result from [Liu et al., 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08042), which suggested that the low pressure from systems like typhoons might be sufficient to trigger so-called [slow earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_earthquake) at subduction zones (like Taiwan), but again, subsequent work has suggested that the triggering attributed originally to barometric pressure changes are probably better explained by (larger) changes in water masses (e.g., [Hsu et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JB011807)).

**TL;DR** It's been researched and occasionally there's been results that are suggestive of barometric pressure changes being able to influence the exact timing of earthquakes or earthquake like processes, but few of them have held up to scrutiny and most seem better explained with changes in water mass instead."

AskScience,"Was reading something related to Rock Salt mining. In places like the Himalayas where rock salt mining is done in cold temperatures, a lot of miners report burns. Why is it so that salt burns in a colder surroundings? Would it be the same reason why the salt ice challenge was so dangerous?","You know how salt has historically been used as a de-icer? That's because salt water has a lower freezing point than normal water, meaning it has to get colder to freeze.

When it gets cold enough anyway, salt water forms something with the cool name of a ""eutectic frigorific mixture,"" which establishes crystals of high-heat-transfer ice crystals on skin at much, much lower temperatures than normal ice. That means really bad frostburn with no sensitivity to know you're even being burned.

This has apparently been idiotically embraced as an ""internet challenge"" enough to merit a Wikipedia page:
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_and_ice_challenge

>The mixture of ice and salt create eutectic frigorific mixture which can get as cold as −18 °C (0 °F).[3]


>The salt and ice challenge can quickly cause second- and third-degree injuries similar to frostbite or being burnt with the metal end of a lighter, as well as causing painful open sores to form on the skin. Due to the numbing sensation of the cold and possible nerve damage during the stunt, participants are often unaware of the extent of any injuries sustained during the challenge, only feeling pain once the salt on their skin enters lesions created during the challenge. Skin discoloration from the challenge may remain after the challenge has been attempted.[4][5][6]"
AskScience,Can Musou black / Vanta Black paint defeat police laser and radar speed guns?,"For the sake of argument, I'll assume that the speed guns in question emit a single pulse and look for a reflection.  I would expect actual operation to involve multiple pulses and some behind-the-scenes algorithms to detect a vehicle's speed.  Let's establish some parameters to start.

* Wavelengths in the visible light spectrum are roughly between 380 to 700 nm.
* LIDAR operates at either 905 or 1550 nm.
* Radar speed guns operate in the Ka-band, which has a wavelength of about 1 cm, or 1,000,000 nm.
   
Musou Black published some [specifications](https://www.the-black-market.com/specifications/).  If you look at the reflectance plots, you'll see that the reflectance of Musou Black increases sharply once we're out of the visible range.  However, the plot only shows reflectance values of up to 2%, so we don't really know how well Musou Black performs at the wavelengths of interest.  Linearly extrapolating, the paint might fuzz a 950 nm lidar, but a vehicle would likely still reflect significantly at the license plate and headlights.  Higher wavelengths as with a radar-based speed gun would produce a much more significant reflection.  
   
In summary, coating your car with Musou Black might make it slightly more difficult for it to register on a speed gun, under certain circumstances ... but I wouldn't recommend relying on that."
AskScience,How do the alveoli maintain a different air composition to the atmosphere if they are connected to the atmosphere by an open tube?,"They don't maintain the same oxygen, while the air is in the alveoli, the oxygen level in the air goes down because there's a gradient that causes the oxygen in the atmosphere to diffuse into the plasma of the blood. At the same time the carbon dioxide in the blood plasma is higher than in the atmospheric air in the alveoli so it diffuses across the barrier from the blood into the air and is exhaled. The gas that you breathe out is not the same composition as the gas that you breathe in because the gas is diffused across a semi permeable barrier into and out of the bloodstream."
AskScience,Can you (roughly) determine the dosage of a drug taken based off of the blood concentration?,"In a criminal justice context, an expert toxicologist's opinion is often in the form of whether the concentration in the blood is ""consistent with a therapeutic range.""  
  
So, for a given medication, there will be studies that say something like (just some random numbers here) ""this medication is usually dispensed in doses of 10mg once per day at the low end and 70mg once per day at the high end.  People who take a 10mg dose typically have a blood concentration that peaks between X and 2X after approximately an hour, and people who take a 70mg dose typically have a blood concentration that peaks between 7X and 14X after an hour.  The substance in the blood has a typical half-life of 8 to 12 hours.  On a daily dose, baseline blood levels will stabilize at Y for 10mg daily and Z for 70mg daily.""  
  
So, let's say someone has 80X in their blood.  A toxicologist will be able to say with confidence ""that's not consistent with a therapeutic dose - this person ingested way more of the substance than a doctor would ever prescribe.""  So, either drug abuse or poisoning.
  
Now, say someone has 2X in their blood.  A toxicologist can say ""that's consistent with a therapeutic dose"" - but not much more than that.  It's quite possible that person took 10mg or 20mg an hour ago, and takes that every day - but they may have taken 70mg 16 to 24 hours ago as a one-off.  Or they may have taken 40mg 12 hours ago, and every other day for the last month.  Or they may have taken 1,000mg 48 hours ago.  
  
So, that's some of the nuance: it's fairly easy to *rule out* certain dosage quantities/timelines, but it's much harder to say what actually did happen.  A lot of the time, the first one's all that's needed."
AskScience,"In an oxygen-free environment or vacuum, would a very hot piece of wood melt? What about meat?","Initially, in a biological substance like wood or meat, there will be chemical substances like water or light organic molecules within the mix of chemical substances. As the temperature rises, these will boil off at their respective boiling points. At a higher temperature, pyrolysis will take place, where complex organic molecules break down, with the chemical structure of the molecules coming apart and the different elements ending up as different, simpler compounds. The result will be a bunch of steam, nitrogen, hydrogen and other light molecules, and a solid core of carbon graphite. This is essentially what happens when you burn wood into charcoal, you drive off the lighter compounds and reform the wood into near pure carbon. Eventually, if the temperature is high enough, the carbon will melt, but that happens at a very high temperature indeed."

The researchers found that the noises always coincided with a temperature inversion (cold air trapped under a lid of warm air) and appear to be caused by the release of static charge, linked to changes in atmospheric electricity caused by the aurora’s disturbance to Earth’s magnetic field.""

AskScience,How did sea mammals evolve to have a blow hole in the top of their heads?,"The other posts are correct, and blow holes are absolutely nostrils moved to a new location that aids survival in the sea.

But I'd like to address your other statement - how can a new feature develop if it never existed before?

Eyes are a prime example of this. 

Cells react to light because light causes chemical reactions. They can't NOT react to light. Following or avoiding light is very useful - to find food or to avoid predators, to get to where things are better or away from things that are dangerous.

Over time, some cells do better than others, or are in the right place, and if that is useful for survival, mutations favor creatures with more useful light-reacting cells. This is the beginning of a retina.

Funny trick of physics: a pit is a great way to gather light, it is also a great way to determine the direction of light - like a light compass. Very useful. Mutations that make a pit around such  light-sensitive, proto-retinal cells give a survival advantage.

Deeper pits are even better, and if they get so deep that they leave just a tiny pinhole, well, you have what amounts to a 'pinhole camera' going on, and that allows imaging. Very, very useful, and even more survival advantage.

But pits can get stuff trapped in them. The animals who have transparent membranes over the pits - bits of skin that let light through - do better, so now you have a ball with a lens. The beginning of an eye. 

Keep following this basic concept and, given hundreds of millions of years, you have eyes. From nothing more than skin cells.

That is how new features can develop 'from nothing'."

AskScience,Will filling an inflatable boat with helium or hydrogen make it more buoyant?,"Technically yes, but the difference is small enough that it's not worth it.

The density of water is approximately 1,000 kg/m^3 (depending on temperature, salinity, etc...). The density of air at room temperature is about 1.2 kg/m^3 and the density of hydrogen is about 0.09 kg/m^(3).

Now the difference between hydrogen and air seems huge, more than a factor 10. But what ultimately matters for buoyancy is the difference between the density of water and the density of the object you're trying to make float, which is the combination of the boat materials and whatever is used to inflate it.

Compared to water and the solid materials the boat is made from, the contribution of the gas used to inflate the boat is negligible. So for the purposes of buoyancy, it really doesn't matter which gas you use to inflate the boat. And that's why air is used, because it's everywhere, safe and easy to handle."
AskScience,"In a turbofan engine, what provides the thrust?","That's a great couple of questions. First, though, I need to clear something up: there is no ""explosion"" in the burner can of a jet engine. 

Think of a jet as a tube shaped a little like an hourglass turned on its side, but open at both ends. In the front of the engine is a set of fans, called compressors, that push intake air down into the narrowing tube (toward the middle of the hourglass). As this air moves toward the narrow middle of the engine, it is forced into a smaller and smaller space. This does several things: increases its pressure, velocity, and its temperature. 

When it reaches the narrow midsection of the engine, fuel (kerosene, usually) is sprayed into the moving air. If the engine is just starting up, a type of spark plug is used to ignite the fuel mixture. (If the engine is already running, there is fire in the burner can, so the igniter plugs are not needed.)

As the fuel mixture burns, its temperature increases. As it does, it expands. It is now moving through an ever-widening tube, and the expansion keeps it moving (even helping push it along faster). 

At the end of the tube is a turbine that looks very much like a fan. Instead of pushing the air, though, the turbine is pushed BY the air (exhaust gasses). 

The turbine is connected by a shaft to the compressor fan in the front, and it keeps the compressor spinning, so the combustion process is continuous. 

That's how the burning process works. To answer your question about ""What provides the thrust?"", it depends on the engine. In a pure turbojet, the thrust comes from the pressure of the exhaust gasses as they leave the burner can and, later, the engine. 

In a turbofan (which is what you asked about), the compressor blades are MUCH larger than the burner can, and push far more air into the engine housing than is needed for combustion. The extra air is simply directed (or ""bypassed"") around the burner can, blending with the exhaust on the way out the back. BUT this ""bypass air"" is being pushed by the compressor fan, just like what the propeller on a prop plane does, so it provides substantial thrust, too. 

You can tell by looking at jet engines what kind they are. Pure turbojets are very narrow, kind of like a big metal cigar. Early turbofans are larger, the clue being that the fan in the front of the housing is much larger than the exhaust tube in the back. 

There are also so-called high-bypass turbofans, like on newer Boeing and Airbus planes that direct 75-80% of their intake air around the burner. Propellers are very efficient at moving aircraft, so these high-bypass engines produce most of their thrust from the bypass air, and are much more efficient than pure turbojets.

I hope this helps! Cheers!"
AskScience,Why is thiamine the predominant nutritional deficiency in alcoholics?,"Oh! I can give you some answers here! I wrote a paper on this a couple of semesters back for a human physiology class. 

1) Alcohol interferes with absorption of thiamine in the gut.

2) Alcohol interferes with the conversion of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate, which is the form that participates in the citric acid cycle.

3) Alcoholics tend to have poor diets overall.

4) They will often have other nutritional deficiencies as well, but thiamine deficiency in alcoholics can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome which can cause brain damage, cognitive deficits, memory loss, and even death.  So treating thiamine deficiency is often a higher priority than other deficiencies."

Joints don’t need much deposition though to cause pain which is why this is such a common area, while you really need a substantial accumulation for significant kidney damage for example.

One example is post strep/staph glomerulonephrits.

Demo charges for like clearing cliffs to build a road? Generally an electric wire is used there. Just cut the wire, there is no active current running through it. If you are near the explosive, you can probably just yank off the wire too. Due to the usage its not like they're designed to withstand sabotage.

Additionally, while not quite defusing, controlled explosions are a thing. Like smaller anti-personel mines can simply be shot from a safe distance. It's pretty cool, not gonna lie."
AskScience,Is there a genetic disease where the heterozygote has more severe disease symptoms than the homozygote?,"Yes; the best studied mechanism for this is cellular interference. 

PCDH19 is the classic human disease example. It's a protocadherin (cell surface protein that affects migration, signaling, etc) on the X chromosome. When both normal and abnormal PCDH19 is present (XX heterozygotes) affected individuals have epilepsy and developmental delay because neurons with different variants behave differently and have trouble forming networks with each other. XY males, regardless of whether there is a mutant or wt allele are normal. XXY males or mosaic males have the same phenotype as heterozygous females. 

This is an illustration: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98182/figure/depienne.f4/

EFNB1 is another example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605834/ 

OLD paper postulating this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1686061/

Edit: I know you said you're not interested in sex chromosomes, but this disease mechanism applies just as easily to autosomal genes. We can predict based on males that a true mutant homozygote would be unaffected while a compound heterozygote would be affected. 

The problem with finding an autosomal example is being homozygous outside of a consanguinous situation is exceedingly improbable. Not only do both alleles need to develop a disease causing mutation, but they need to mutate in the same way by chance. Most recessive diseases we see are caused by a compound heterozygous state; which while not wild type, it also not homozygous."
AskScience,"Something about what we're always told about climate change doesn't make sense to me, can someone explain?","> when climate change rolls around the ocean is supposedly gonna rise a whole 10 feet or higher within the next 20 years,

Not sure where that number came from and that's a gross exaggeration of any actual projection in terms of magnitude and rate. One important aspect of sea level rise is that projections fundamentally depend on how much greenhouse gas we emit in the future. For short term (e.g., 10-20 years), it doesn't matter too much since the sea level rise that will occur over that time largely reflects warming *that has already happened*, but for further time frames, which scenario (i.e., which [representative concentration pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway) or [shared socioeconomic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways)) we choose matters (and thus introduces uncertainty that is not really reducible). Let's consider this [sea level rise projection tool](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool). If we pick a sort of middle of the road prediction (SSP 2-4.5) and look at predictions for 2040 (i.e., 20 years from now) and pick the area of the Gulf Coast with the highest projected rise (which is basically southern Louisiana), we can see a projected rise of 0.45 meters (1.47 feet). Even choosing the worst case (SSP 8.5), projected rise is 0.46 meters (1.5 feet). Sticking with worst case (SSP 8.5 and southern Louisiana) and looking [out to 2150](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool?lat=28&lon=%20-91&data_layer=scenario) we see the max rise is ~2.38 meters (7.8 feet). Comparing our middle of the road (SSP2-4.5) and our worst case (SSP8.5 - click on the different scenarios at the bottom to add them to the graph) also highlights the idea that the projections increasingly diverge further into the future reflecting that sea level rise (1) lags temperature rise and (2) the amount of rise depends on the temperature, and thus emissions, in the future. The amount of sea level rise that is projected is still *extremely problematic*, but hyperbolic and demonstrably false future scenarios are not a helpful part of the conversation.

> but if any banks believed it that would mean you couldn't get a mortgage on a house anywhere in like London, Manhattan, would be covered in water constantly almost anywhere in Florida or Louisiana would be under the water right? 

This seems to reflect a lack of actually paying attention to what's happening in various places. Probably the most immediate effect has been the collapse (or the beginning of the collapse) of the insurance markets in the coastal regions of various gulf states (e.g., [this news article](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4068383-insurers-pull-back-as-us-climate-catastrophes-intensify/) or [this news article](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/11/03/with-climate-impacts-growing-insurance-companies-face-big-challenges/), or [this other one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/07/insurance-coverage-loss-climate-change/)). More broadly, the discussion of the climate change related challenges the insurance industry (and people trying to buy insurance) face are also well represented in the scholarly literature (e.g., [Wagner, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01514-2)). What those all highlight is that it's getting harder to get (homeowners) insurance, in part because insurers are either going broke or leaving because the risk is too high and more expensive to get what is available (both homeowners and flood insurance) because of increased risk and/or decreased competition (i.e., if literally only one company will insure your house, you don't have much choice about what they want to charge). A large driver of this is both past expenses incurred by increasingly frequent disasters and increased risk (though it's worth noting, that it's not all climate change, there's some heaping doses of political and bureaucratic influences as well). Similar things are being seen in relation to other hazards increasing with climate change, e.g., [the recent decision for a large insurer to stop insuring new homes in California due to wildfire risk](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/05/state-farm-stopped-insuring-california-homes-due-to-climate-risks-but-it-shares-lobbyists-with-big-oil). Unless you're buying a house with cash, getting homeowners insurance is typically a prerequisite for a bank to agree to loan you the money for a house, so the effects are there if you look.

> Yet a few left leaning/ climate concerned politicians have even bought places in Florida, please explain this.

Individual's assessment of risk is, unsurprisingly, individualized. I.e., that someone who likely has large amounts of disposable income and additional homes chooses to buy/build a home in a high risk area reflects mostly that if that house is destroyed, they can either rebuild or move with (comparative) ease. Focusing on choices of individuals with the means to insulate themselves from many problems ""normal"" people cannot is a red herring and of little relevance beyond, ""rich people going to do rich people things."""
AskScience,How do we know that Endogenous Retroviruses point to a common ancestor?,"Not sure if this is a good analogy, but one good explanation I heard for this is that ERVs on the genetic code are like stains on a paper copy.

AskScience,Can empirical evidence exist for specific selective pressures in evolution?,"I think it can only be empirically answered via experimental manipulation. Eg ornament manipulation:  male birds of species X have long ornamental tail feathers, did this evolve through natural selection or sexual selection? If you were to artificially lengthen some males tails feathers and found that they had greater reproductive success, but greater vulnerability to predators, then you can be reasonably sure that long tail feathers evolved via sexual selection (probably also performing the converse experiment too)"
AskScience,Does normal metabolic function eventually return to formerly obese individuals that underwent major weight loss?,"Part of the problem is the adipose cells. When you become overweight your adipose stem cells proliferate. If you lose weight the cells essentially deflate, but they are still there secreting hormones affecting metabolism. They are also waiting to fill back up if you fall off the wagon. Adipose cells can stick around for 8ish years, so it can take awhile. It isn’t clear if everything goes back to normal over time, but I hypothesize after about a decade of discipline you’ll be back in business."
AskScience,What lifeform has the shortest genetic sequence?,"It depends.

The organism with the smallest genome for naturally occurring cellular organisms is probably *Mycoplasma genitalium*. 

There are synthetic cells that have a smaller genome, but these are lab-made, not free-living. 

Then there are viruses; are they life forms ? That’s another debate. If you include viruses, then *Circovirus* probably has the smallest genome. 

Pushing it to the extreme, you’d have viroid “genomes”, which are only a couple hundreds nucleotides, but that might be really pushing the definition of what a life form is."
AskScience,"Why is the whole Martian surface mostly red, when the geology of earth has a wide variety in rock colour?","We'll start with the caveat that from the surface [Mars is less *red* than it is *butterscotch* and that there is some variability in color depending on area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_surface_color). Caveats aside, the lower diversity of rock colors - and in general the lower diversity of rock types - on Mars compared to Earth is primarily a reflection that Mars does not have plate tectonics (and likely never did, or at least not tectonics like Earth does). The variety of rock types (and corresponding compositions) we see on Earth, in large part reflects [igneous differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_differentiation) and [partial melting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_melting) wherein (in *very basic* terms) mantle peridotites are partially melted to make basalt/gabbros, basalts/gabbros are partially melted to make andesites/diorites, and andesites/diorites are partially melted to make rhyolites/granites. On Mars, we basically only see the first step (i.e., most of the surface is effectively basalts or sedimentary rocks made from weathered basalt) where the latter steps in the chain largely require active tectonic processes and the corresponding unique geochemical/thermal conditions in specific active tectonic environments. So, no active plate tectonics, no andesites/diorites or rhyolites/granites (again in *super simplified terms*). Basalt, as a [mafic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafic) rock is relatively rich in iron and iron bearing minerals, where the oxidation of iron rich minerals is a large part of the butterscotch/red color of Mars (i.e., rust, basically).

An intricately linked bit is the existence of large amounts of water, both in the form of hydrated minerals in the crust/mantle but also as free water on the surface (or correspondingly the lack of this on Mars for at least most of its history). Water is essential both to many aspects of the partial melting process and thus igneous differentiation, but also likely to functioning and persistent active Earth like plate tectonics ([see this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/tectonics_life/)). The large amounts of water, and the development of life, also allows for the development of other rock types that are not prevalent (or non existent) on Mars, e.g., carbonates, coal, etc. Carbonates are not always biologically mediated, and [there are carbonate minerals on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonates_on_Mars), but there is not evidence of large deposits of carbonates (e.g., from reef building organisms, etc.) on Mars like there are on Earth."

AskScience,"Geckos use Van Der Waals forces to stick to walls, but how do they let go?","Funny story about geckos and VDW forces...

[In 2014, a study by Hadi Izadi, Katherine Stewart, and Alexander Penlidis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4233685/) determined that van der Waal's force isn't the primary cause of a gecko's ability to stick to things. Instead, it's a phenomenon called contact electrification-driven (CE-driven) electrostatic interaction.  
Dellit, the scientist who originally did a lot of studies on geckos and who is referenced quite often when dealing with them, dismissed CE-driven electrostatic interactions as being the reason geckos can stick to things.  
The linked paper goes on to explain the flaws in Dellit's testing methods and why CE worked even after Dellit tried to eliminate it.

It should be noted that van der Waals force *does* play a part in the gecko's abilty to stick to things but it's not the true reason a gecko can stick to almost any surface.  

Regardless of the technical reason behind the ability to stick, the setae (see-tee) on its feet are what are responsible for being able to stick and unstick. And when a gecko wants to let go, it does so the same way we remove a strong magnet from something. We pull up at one point and break the magnetic bond.  
If you have a strong magnet on a fridge, you don't just grab it and pull it straight back. You pry it from one corner (usually sliding it off the edge of the fridge so you can pull up on one edge).  
Geckos do the same thing. When they want to let go, they angle their setae away from the surface and this breaks the grip/attraction.  
It doesn't pull its foot straight back all at once. It slightly twists, breaking contact at an edge where the force is weakest.

Edit: Typos and clarified a couple sentences."
AskScience,Why do we vaccinate people instead of injecting them directly with antibodies? Is there a particular reason people need to generate the antibodies themselves?,"Antibodies are proteins that will eventually degrade. You could get regular antibody infusions but they would not last as long as having your own immune cells to produce them as needed (which you get from a vaccine). Immune cells can last decades, even entire lifetimes, antibodies last weeks to months at best. 

There is more to the immune system than just antibodies. Vaccines can also activate immune cells called T cells which have many important roles. There are different types of antibodies, with different roles, including antibodies in the mucus membranes which you would not get from an infusion. Additionally, the cells that make antibodies can make better antibodies with each exposure, selecting variants of antibodies that bind antigens best (which is important when the antigens themselves are also changing). 

So yes you could give antibodies, and in some cases we do give antibodies, but vaccines are generally going to be much better."
AskScience,"How is Silver so electrically conductive, and yet non magnetic?","This is a physics question. Electric fields and magnetic fields are linked, but you are looking at the behavior of electrons in materials here. The conductivity depends on how well electrons can move across the material, while the magnetic properties depend on how the magnetic moment of electrons (from their spin and their orbitals) align. These are generally independent things.

Silver is diamagnetic, like many other elements. An external field will change the orientation of the magnetic moments of the electrons in silver, creating a weak opposing field. Copper, another excellent conductor, is diamagnetic as well.

In everyday use, ""magnetic"" usually refers to ferromagnetism, where the magnetic moments in the material will be aligned easily by an external field and point in the same direction (the material will be attracted by a magnet), and they can be aligned even in the absence of an external field, which means the material can be a permanent magnet. This is a very unusual condition and only a few pure elements show it, with iron being the most notable one. Usually we encounter iron as steel - some versions of it are ferromagnetic, others are not, it depends on the composition."
AskScience,Why were the control rods in the reactor featured in the HBO series 'Chernobyl' (2019) tipped with graphite?,"The design of the RBMK is fundamentally backwards. It’s all about the relative values of reactivity. 

Coolant (water) goes in the bottom of the RBMK and boils as it goes up. Because this is a graphite moderated reactor, water has less moderation capability than the graphite. This is important because liquid water will reduce your neutron mean free path distance (how far the neutron travels before it is absorbed by something or lost from the reactor). As the water boils, it’s density drops significantly and the mean free path length for neutrons increases. 

So let’s put this together. At the bottom of the reactor, you have neutrons which are more or less struggling to find graphite, get moderated, and get back into the fuel, before leaking out or being absorbed without causing fission. 

At the top of the reactor, your neutrons have a very easy time getting to the graphite to get moderated and cause fission. 

This also means the power generated at the bottom of the reactor is less than the top of the reactor (axial flux tilt is top peaked). 

But the top of the reactor has less coolant (because much of the water has already boiled to steam). So the top of the reactor has a tendency to produce more power, with less coolant, which is inherently a risk to exceeding critical power ratio. While the bottom of the reactor, even with all control rods out, has little power production, and is also very sensitive to emergencies which cause rapid voiding since there are typically no control rods down there just to keep the bottom of the core running. 

As a result, the RBMK has control rods which come in from the top. Backwards for a boiling type reactor but a necessity. 

So what’s the problem here? Where the bottom of the reactor is going to not only barely have any power output, the fuel is going to be wasted down there, it’s more sensitive to certain transients, so what did they do? They put graphite followers on the rods. To help boost the reactivity in the bottom of the core. Yes this is a dumb idea, but on its own it’s not terrible. With the followers inserted in the core, they no longer have positive reactivity to add. They already have “done their damage” so to speak. So if you had a power spike, as the rods inserted, the graphite followers would be pushed down out of the core and be replaced with control rods. 

This was a “win win” for this dumb backwards reactor. 

Except….. if you ever find yourself pulling the followers out of the reactor, especially if you also have low reactor coolant flow and pressure and other conditions which could cause rapid boiling, and you have low control rod density, then the effect of a scram is to push the followers back into the core and cause a power spike. 

Why there weren’t mechanical limits on the control rods equipped with followers or other system interlocks is beyond me. This design “feature” should never have existed without something in place to ensure those followers cannot be removed beyond a certain position. Or better yet, don’t build backwards reactor designs."
AskScience,Why are plasma transfusions different from blood transfusions?,"Something thats misunderstood is if you go donate a pint of blood at the Red Cross, you are donating what is called ""Whole Blood"". You are right that Whole Blood contains both red blood cells and plasma. **Because of this, there is no universal donor for Whole Blood.** For most transfusions we do not transfuse Whole Blood. Usually, your Whole Blood donation is separated and processed into two other products: Packed Red Blood Cells and some form of Plasma (Fresh Frozen, PF24, Liquid). For reasons stated above, the universal donor for pRBCs is O Neg. And the universal donor for Plasma is AB (Rh-type doesn't matter).

Normally in emergencies where we don't know the patients blood type. We transfuse all the parts of Whole Blood separately. We give group O pRBCs, AB plasma, and Platelets (where type generally doesn't matter)

In extreme emergencies, where patients have massive hemorrhage, some places may carry and transfuse Whole Blood regardless of blood type. This product is usually called Low Titer O Whole Blood. We use O Blood so the RBCs are guaranteed to be compatible, but O Whole Blood has antibodies in the plasma that can be dangerous (Anti-A, Anti-B, and even a third one somewhat confusingly called Anti-A,B). So what we do is ""titer"" the donors to see how strong these antibodies are, and select only weaker ""low titer"" donors. This minimizes the risk of possible transfusion reaction. Most places that do use Low Titer O will only give 2 or 4 units of it before switching to individual components."
AskScience,How is radioactive dating used to determine historical greenhouse gas levels and temperatures?,"The dating doesn't give you the gas levels or temperatures.

Instead separate samples are taken through an ice core, or a sediment core, or a rock sequence. Separate analyses are done on the samples to measure the greenhouse gas levels, temperatures, and ages.

Sediment samples might have carbon isotopes measured as a proxy for CO2, ice cores might have gas bubbles analysed, there's a whole suite of different measurements possible. The dating is totally separate and just puts some age pins on those measurements."
AskScience,"If a reflection hologram is recorded using coherent laser light, why do some areas appear out of focus?","I can't give you a complete answer, but one major contribution to the blurriness is from viewing the hologram with white light. The hologram was made using monochromatic (or nearly monochromatic) light. Since holograms like this one work on the principle of diffraction, and diffraction depends explicitly on the wavelength, you expect all features in the viewed hologram to be distorted when viewing it with polychromatic light. My intuition is that the scale of the holographic image is changing with wavelength, so you are effectively looking at many different images of different colors, each with a slightly different scaling, which smears edges and gives the edges a color gradient (this is clearly visible on the ropes)."
AskScience,Is it possible that Pi repeats at some point?,"Pi is an [irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number), one of the properties of an irrational number is that its decimal representation never ends nor repeats itself.

So, this raises the question (1) how do we know irrational numbers don't have repeating decimals and (2) how do we know pi is irrational. 

To answer the first one. First, what is an irrational number? An irrational number is a number which cannot be expressed a a fraction of two whole numbers. Easy example, 3/8 = 0.375 is a rational number, but something like the sqrt(2) is irrational- there is no fraction of whole numbers which will exactly equal the sqrt(2). This is one of the first proofs you will learn in analysis, and [it is pretty easy to follow to see why](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html). So, how do we know no irrational number has repeating decimals? Because if it did, it could be expressed as the ratio of 2 whole numbers. To steal the example from the above link, let's say we have the number 0.7162162162.... and we want to prove it's not irrational. Well, the algorithm to find the rational expression of it is:

(1) Call the original number A = 0.7162162162... We see there is 1 number before the repeating starts, so multiple the number of 10^1, thus saying 10A =  7.162162162...

(2) Now, we see that the repeating part is 3 decimals long, so, we also calculate (10^(3))\*10A = 10,000A = 7162.162162...

(3) Subtract 10,000A from 10A and get 10,000A-10A = 9,990A = 7,155

(4) And thus, A = 7155/9990. Thus, 0.7162162162... is rational

So, that's one example, but the process is the same, no matter what the length of the repeating is. So, we have shown that no irrational numbers have repeating decimals. 

So, we're left to prove number 2 from above- that Pi is irrational. That is harder. In fact, I don't know any proof for them which I could easily type out here, using the limited formatting options Reddit provides. But, [there is a series of proofs on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational) if you want to read any of them.

AskScience,"Back in the late 90s, I remember hearing that scientists “cloned a sheep”. What actually happened with the cloning, and what advancements have been made as a result of that?","The process that resulted in Dolly was somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The process was a big deal because it demonstrated that there was a way to reprogram a cell from a ""somatic"" state to an earlier developmental state.   


This method was developed roughly at the same time that scientists first isolated and grew human embyonic stem cells, which were isolated from pre-implantation embryos. (as an aside, mouse ES cells have been around for much longer, but hESCs proved tougher to keep going in culture).  


Human ES cells are super useful in research because they can be used to generate many different cell types, which we can use to model disease and generally understand tissues that might be otherwise hard to get from humans (think neurons or heart cells).  


The limitation of human ES cells is that they're hard to make with the exact genetic makeup that you might want to study. For example, let's pretend that I care about a genetic disease like Huntington's disease, which affects specific regions of the brain. If I want to study human cells in a dish, my options are limited, since getting a biopsy of the brain and growing neurons isn't going to be easy.   


If you could make ES cells with a Huntington mutation, you would have a basically endless supply of human neurons, but to do that you'd need an embryo with the Huntington disease genotype.  


This is where the insight from Dolly comes in: because of Dolly, scientists knew that reprogramming was possible, and a few labs set out to figure out how to do it without physically transplanting a nucleus into an egg cell. The result was the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), which was a big deal and won a nobel prize. Basically, the recipe to reprogram cells using just 4 proteins was identified, and has led to a tool that is widely used around the world. Any patient's somatic cells can now be reprogrammed into iPSCs, which can in turn be used to generate all sorts of cell types to help explain the underlying biology associated with many conditions."
AskScience,Is a solid just a liquid with really high viscosity?,"In general, no. A fluid with high viscosity will deform continuously under even an infinitesimally small amount of force over sufficient time. A solid won't.

There are composite materials, such as gels, which blur the lines, but only because they're more than one material linked together.

Lots of solids can be *fluidized*, like sand, but these are composite, as there are gaps, and therefore air, making them act as composite materials again.

The only way a solid can be a liquid with high viscosity is if you accept that at some point, that viscosity is permitted to effectively be infinite or permit the material to crack or deform.

But that's just it: the very definition of solid precludes that it cannot be a liquid or a gas. Period."
AskScience,"After the universe reaches maximum entropy and ""completes"" it's heat death, could quantum fluctuations cause a new big bang?","This is an area with a lot of speculative 'narratives' and not a lot of evidence-based science.

Here's an actual fact:  The origin of the universe is an unsolved physics problem.

There are plenty of believable stories about how the universe started but there are no direct observations to check them against.  We do reliably know that the universe we see now evolved from an early hot and dense state but that's about as far as the evidence goes.   The laws of physics as we understand them do not have a way of creating a big bang, so physicists are forced to come up with new theoretical ideas that might do it.  So far, there is nothing that ticks all the boxes and, even if we got that, the question of validation might remain.

One of the ideas is that the universe was started by a quantum fluctuation.  If that's correct it might happen again in the future.  The problem is that this creation out of a quantum blip speculation might be completely wrong.  It has zero evidence.

There's another problem with speculating about the distant future universe.   It's a long, long time away and the physical laws we have all have accuracy limits.  A tiny effect that might cause entropic reversal or gravitational collapse (or something) that operates at scales of say 10^(100) seconds might not even be detectable during the current lifetime of the universe, like 3 x 10^(16) seconds.

So, we don't know.  The initial universe and anything earlier is behind an evidence barrier.  Prediction of the ""end state"" universe could be wrong.  Maybe one day we will have a physics theory that covers these situations that we can all agree on, but for now, we don't.

As per usual, the evidence problem has not resulted in a shortage of ideas.

AskScience,Can scientists use mitochondrial DNA to tell when Darwin’s Finches arrived on the Galapagos?,"mtDNA and DNA in general can be used to estimate age back to a certain point where nucleotide substitutions start occuring on top of older substitutions and the exact number of mutations becomes difficult or impossible to reconstruct accurately.   


You can get an estimate of the population size of an ancestral population but only if it is recent enough that the previous point is not a problem.

AskScience,"Pre-Bronze-Age Earth must have had sufficient easily accessible deposits of copper, tin, iron, gold and other metals in such abundance to equip vast armies. How likely is it that similar metal ore veins can be found in a native state on the surface of Mars?","It's possible, but would occur to a significantly lesser degree than here on earth.

[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/mars-ocean](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/mars-ocean)

Liquid water likely existed on Mars for a relatively small window of 500ish million years, but a fully functional water cycle was mostly concentrated in a relatively small area of the planet for a smaller portion of that time.

Said water cycle would also slow dramatically as the temperature dropped, so while liquid water existed somewhere on the surface over that period, the colder the planet got the slower the cycle went.

At a certain point, the primary way water would return to the oceanic lowlands would be by glaciation, which while technically still part of the water cycle, doesn't do much that would promote hydrothermal concentration of metals.

TLDR: probably not a lot."
AskScience,"Since we use multiple telescopes on Earth to increase the resolution in interferometry, Is it possible to build a network of space telescopes around Earths orbit to make a space telescope around 2au wide?","Nope, no major scientific barriers here. It's purely an engineering problem - albeit a very big one!

In addition to knowing the orientation and distance between all satellites at a very high precision, you also need to combine the data from all these telescopes at quite a high cadence. In optical and infrared astronomy, it isn't possible to do this digitally - you have to literally combine the beams on site. In radio astronomy, it's possible to do this digitally, which is why you can have unconnected radio telescopes across the world combining data to form the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Similarly, this is why it could be quite possible to spread a bunch of relatively cheap antennae on the far side of the Moon and get a nice low noise Moon sized radio telescope.

However, the amount of data you need can get quite big, especially as you look at higher frequencies (which is where you get the best resolution). Part of the delay for the EHT images of supermassive black holes is that the most efficient way to transmit that data was to put a bunch of hard drives on a boat and literally ship the data. Weather etc caused some delays in getting all the data in one place to be combined.

In space, this problem is way harder, just because of the distances involved. You need more powerful antennae, and it's not practical to send rockets filled with hard drives around every time.

So yeah, it's possible, it's just going to be tricky and risky, and there's a few smaller steps we should try first. Even a Moon-Earth scale telescope is still going to be a while away."

AskScience,Could pure iron become a bose Einstein condensate at extremely low temperatures?,"Unlike stated in a different answer, by far most of the naturally occurring iron is bosonic (about 98%) and thus could totally form a BEC.


The difference to Helium-4 is that iron is a metal, which indicates already that the interactions between iron atoms are very different from interactions between helium atoms. We can make BECs out of metals (Rubidium for example, or Cesium or potassium), but only in low density systems at very low temperatures (densities more than a billion times lower than ordinary metals, and temperatures well below 1 Mikrokelvin). It's technically much more tricky to create these low temperatures with iron due to their more complicated level structure, but these technical issues aside, we could also create an Iron BEC.


Note that doesn't necessarily mean that iron will also form a BEC when you just take a block of it and magically cool it down to some low temperature. The phase diagram usually strongly depends on the density, and this might favor a different ground state for the extremely high density of ordinary iron compared to the extremely dilute clouds used to make other BECs from metals like Rubidium or Cesium."

AskScience,How are we able to date EVERY fossil with radiometric dating?,"In short, we are not and it's actually relatively rare that we date fossils directly in the sense of getting an absolute age on the fossil material itself, specifically because (A) fossils do not tend to be composed of material that lends itself well to radiometric dating or (B) the fossilization process does not ""reset"" isotope systematics such that a radiometric date would be meaningful. Exceptions would be dating things through [radiocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating), [amino acid racemization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid_dating), or [U-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93thorium_dating), but these are all relatively limited in terms of how far back we can date materials and/or when these dates are meaningful for the age of the fossil. Instead, establishing ages of fossils largely fall into one of three categories: 

1. Dating the rocks in which the fossil is hosted. Since most fossils are hosted in sedimentary rocks, this poses its own challenges as many sedimentary rocks are hard to radiometrically date. There are some methods that allow us to constrain the ages of these however. For example, for sandstones, it's common to estimate the maximum depositional age (MDA) via detrital zircon U-Pb dating. In short, you date a bunch of zircons within a sandstone sample via U-Pb and the youngest age population in that suite of ages is the maximum age permissible for the sediment to be deposited. With respect to your mentioning of things like uranium being relatively rare, this is generally true, but there are minerals (like zircon) where these ""trace elements"" tend to partition during igneous processes. So even while uranium is a pretty small component of your average zircon, there is enough for us to accurately and reliably date via U-Pb. An MDA can be pretty close to true depositional age if there was a source of young zircons at the time of deposition, but can also be a pretty rough constraint if the source was predominantly older rocks. If we expand our consideration to non-radiometric techniques, methods like [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy) are quite helpful for dating rocks hosting fossils.
2. Dating rocks above and below the horizon hosting the fossil. If we can't constrain the age of the rock hosting the fossil (e.g., MDAs don't constrain it and/or doesn't contain zircon, the rock is too coarse for magstrat or during a very long normal/reverse period, etc.), we can potentially bracket the age via dating rocks above and below. The most direct example of this would be exploiting interbedded volcanic ash horizons (i.e., tephra) as these effectively represent instantaneous events. If our fossil is hosted in a sedimentary rock with interbedded ashes and we date the one below our fossil to X million years and the one above our fossil to Y million years, then we know the fossil is between X-Y million years old. This is just one straightforward example of this, but there are *lots* of variations on this theme.
3. Correlation. Even if we can't date the rock hosting our fossil in the place we found that fossil, we can often correlate that deposit to a deposit in an area where we can better constrain the age of the deposit. Just like with radiometric dating, there are a whole host of methods for stratigraphic correlation, each with their own uncertainties and challenges, so as with radiometric dating, we try to use a suite of methods to correlate rocks to try to minimize those uncertainties.

Finally, it's worth noting that generally once we have a well established set of age criteria for a given fossil (i.e., we've established its first occurrence and last occurrence in the fossil record through the methods above), it's not as though we are constantly attempting to re-date these fossils. In reality, we also flip it around and *use the fossils to date the rocks*, i.e., [biostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostratigraphy).

EDIT: It's worth adding that geochronologists are constantly expanding the range of what can be dated. For example, attempts at direct radiometric dating of carbonates with U-Pb was largely considered to produce garbage results for a long time, but gradually we're getting a better handle on how to apply it. Review papers like those from [Rasbury & Cole, 2009](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007RG000246) and [Roberts et al., 2020](https://gchron.copernicus.org/articles/2/33/2020/) highlight how far we've come in our ability to apply this methodology, including (given the right conditions and pretty careful analysis), direct dating of shell material (e.g., [Drost et al., 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GC007850))."
AskScience,Why does the thyroid use iodine ?,"It's a bit of a mystery. However, the evolutionarily roots of iodine cell signalling is very acient, almost all all multicellular life uses iodine containing molecules, including plants. 

A recent interesting hypothesis proposed that... Given that almost all multicellular life uses iodine containing cell signalling molecules, they must have evolved very early billions of years ago in early single celled organisms, and the development of multicellularity and iodine containing cell signalling molecules went hand in hand. 

The reason why iodine was used, is that molecules that contain iodine are highly reactive and often powerful antioxidants, they are very useful.

AskScience,How do fusion scientists expect to produce enough Tritium to sustain D-T fusion (see text)?,Short answer is that there are ways to make neutrons produce more than one triton. Neutrons can react with lithium-7 to produce tritium + a neutron (which can then go on to react with another lithium-6 or lithium-7 nucleus to produce more tritium). Neutron multipliers such as beryllium that react with neutrons to produce two neutrons can also be included in the tritium bleeding blanket.
AskScience,Why are astronomical impact craters symmetrical without regard to angle?,"When an asteroid hits a large object the speeds are huge, for Earth 11km/s or higher. At those speeds the asteroid has more energy available than a high explosive. So when it hits an object it is essentially a bomb, and that outward energy explodes more or less equally.

At very shallow angles (15 degrees or less) asymmetric craters can form. [Example](https://www.astronomy.com/science/why-are-most-impact-craters-nearly-perfectly-round-id-expect-the-impacts-to-result-from-an-obtuse-or-glancing-blow-that-would-leave-an-oblong-or-ellliptical-shape/)"

AskScience,"What is the highest wet bulb temperature a human can survive, assuming no (or negligible) humidity?","The estimated fatal wet-bulb temperature for humans (and most mammals broadly) is 35 C EDIT - assuming sustained exposure where the exact time is a bit fuzzy  - i.e., these are not instantly fatal and assumes a person is experiencing these conditions for several hours (e.g., [Sherwood & Huber, 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0913352107)). An important point (which may not be clear given the way you're question is written) is that we would expect a wet bulb temperature of 35 C to be fatal *regardless of the relative humidity*. Differences in relative humidity imply different dry bulb temperatures for a given wet bulb temperature (where generally lower relative humidity implies greater differences in wet and dry bulb temperature where dry bulb temperature is always larger than wet bulb temperature until a relative humidity of 100% where they would be equal). 

So really, I think what you're asking is ""For a fatal wet bulb temperature, what's the equivalent dry bulb temperature as a function of humidity?"" For this purpose we can use a [psychrometric chart](https://clothingyellow.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/6/4/126448599/606372389.jpg). This [page](https://www.chemistryscl.com/higherstudies/chemicalengineering/psychrometric_chart/main.html) goes through the details of how to read one, but in short the x-axis is dry bulb temperature, the diagonal green lines are lines of constant wet-bulb temperatures, and the purple concave up curves are lines of constant relative humidity. So, the intersection of a vertical dry bulb temperature with a diagonal wet bulb temperature occurs at a specific relative humidity, e.g., for example the 30 C dry bulb temperature intersects the 20 C wet bulb temperature line at a relative humidity of 40%, i.e., if we measured a dry bulb temp of 30 C and relative humidity is 40%, we'd expect the wet bulb temp to be 20 C. 

Referring to the chart, we can then follow the 35 C wet bulb temp line and see what dry bulb temps they intersect. This is a bit tricky because the chart doesn't cover too much of this space, but the 35 C wet bulb line is there (though it's not labeled, you have to count up 5 from the 30 wet bulb line, it's the line between the ""40"" and ""45"" label along the top for the dry bulb temps). A little easier is to play with a [psychrometric calculator](http://www.hvac-calculator.net/index.php?v=2), which is basically doing the underlying math to construct a similar chart. For this, if you enter a dry bulb temp and a relative humidity and click calculate, it will fill in the rest, including the estimated wet bulb temperature. Using our assumption that a wet bulb temperature of 35 C is fatal, we can go through and with some trial and error find the equivalent dry bulb temperatures (Tdb) and relative humidity (rH) combos that would imply close to a fatal wet bulb temperature:

* 45 C Tdb & 56% rH
* 50 C Tdb & 43% rH
* 55 C Tdb & 31% rH
* 60 C Tdb & 22% rH
* 65 C Tdb & 17% rH (the calculator starts to break much above 65 C)

The *big* caveats here is this is relying on the underlying assumptions in this calculation are met (e.g., we're at sea level, the default values used in the calculator for the other parameters are correct for the conditions in question, etc.) and that there are not other physiological issues that would take over at extreme dry bulb temperatures but where wet bulb temperature does not exceed 35 C, but since largely the fatal wet bulb temperature limit is basically tracking when the combination of air temperature and humidity make it such that a mammal cannot effectively cool itself anymore, this probably puts us in the right ball park for fatal combinations. 

Assuming all of this is correct (which is probably a big assumption), we'd perhaps expect that at *really low humidity* a temp above 55C is survivable. EDIT: See important correction from u/dyrin in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15920n3/comment/jtdwjnj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that suggests the 35 C limit is an overestimate in many conditions, i.e., fatal wet bulb temperatures experienced for significant times are likely less than 35 C in many instances."

AskScience,Why is the smallpox vaccine administered using a bifurcated needle rather than through injection?,"On top of what was said, it was also designed for practicality and cost.  Imagine having to inject billions of people with a typical syringe. It’s too slow, costly, and requires skill. The bifurcated needle was cheap as dirt, delivered the perfect amount of vaccine, required little skill to use, and could be rapidly used to administer the vaccine to billions of people. One of the greatest medical devices ever invented in the history of man, imo.

EDIT - I found the source I’ve read before about smallpox eradication, so to put this in perspective further:

* the bifurcated needle delivered the vax at the ideal depth with rapidity 

* it only cost $5 for 1000 needles

* use of the bifurcated needle allowed vaccinators to deliver 100 vaccinations from a single vial

* pulling this off in real life is harder to comprehend.  India was extremely difficult. People there had more transportation and ability to move large distances very quickly (lots of rail, buses, etc.), so by the time they learned of a smallpox case, the person infected could already infect dozens more due to transportation. In order to eradicate smallpox from India, WHO had the goal of trying to visit every village and door in the country *in only 10 days*.  There’s no way they could have pulled that off unless their huge  volunteer army consisting largely of lay people and untrained medical professionals had the right tool to deliver the vaccine. That’s why it’s such a remarkable device."

AskScience,Is there a global temperature reconstruction going back 700 million years?,"Geologist here, though paleoclimate is nowhere near my specialization (I'm a structural field geologist). A quick google search delivered [this](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dujs/2010/05/30/oceans-of-ice-the-snowball-earth-theory-of-global-glaciation/) result, which is a really interesting review of the Snowball Earth theory circa 2010. The review has a solid set of references to check out and branch from. [This](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) is a good technical article on constraining Paleozoic temperature fluctuations. If you're stuck behind paywalls in your hunt for the references, try [this](https://libgen.is/) website; the search tool is not the best but it has helped me heaps over the years. Anna's Archives is another good site.

[This](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32075449) book is a great read. It doesn't zero in on the topic of paleoclimate; it discusses the six major extinction events that have punctuated life over the last 550M years, and the geological and extraterrestrial events that precipitated them. Excellent interviews and travel stories with paleontology and geology specialists, well written and entertaining. Also, it is great for providing a bit of a sense of scale for the amount of time we're dealing with - but even then, it covers only the most recent half a billion years of earth history.

As to global temperature trends during the Proterozoic and Archaean, the question kind of starts to lose relevance when we step that far back in time, in part because the data one needs are sparse at best, but also because planetary dynamics were almost unfathomably foreign. For example, a key thing to note is that the atmosphere, once it existed, had a completely different composition for the first two billion or so years of earth's history - see the Great Oxidation Event, [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23286-7) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/great-oxygenation-event). Discussion of paleoclimate dynamics is seated in a wildly different context - life in only its earliest, nascent states, very different global hydrodynamic systems, very different rates and processes of erosion. The earth itself was also hotter, internally - see komatiitic lavas, [here](https://www.alexstrekeisen.it/english/vulc/komatiites.php) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/komatiite), for example. And after the GOE, atmospheric composition continued to fluctuate; see [here](https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/01/03/which-came-first-complex-life-or-high-atmospheric-oxygen/). So objective climate temperature measurements can be derived, to a point, but consideration of their context matters very much as well.

What I'm driving at is that the scale of changes quickly grows beyond our conventional scope. We are (very justifiably) concerned with temperature fluctuations in the range of 2-4 degrees in the span of hundreds of years. In contrast, since the end of the [Proterozoic](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/GSA/timescale/home.aspx), global temperature trends have fluctuated by much larger ranges, by up to an [order of magnitude](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) larger, and these fluctuations took place on an earth that barely to eventually only kind of looked like the planet we're living on now. Stepping even further back, Earth's tectonic dynamics, atmospheric dynamics, hydrodynamics, magnetodynamics, everything was so different that the exercise of extrapolating temperature change kind of loses relevance. Discussion of temperature fluctuations that far back requires thoughtful meditation on the context in which those temperature fluctuations were occuring.

Just for fun, [this](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/3/4/220/31158/Tectonic-model-for-the-Proterozoic-growth-of-North) is a brilliant article on the evolution of the North American continent: it steps through time at the scale of accretion of the major tectonic components that make up the continent as we know it today. However, it is Critical to acknowledge that the model is presented always within the context of the geometry of the current continental structure, without consideration of their/its true location on the surface of the planet. All of these tectonic puzzle pieces were essentially drifting their way around the surface of the planet, both as independent pieces and later as coherent, accreted terranes. This is continuing today - tectonics is still very much active and the plates continue to drift across the surface. Point being, all of these tectonic puzzle pieces have existed at very different latitudes and longitudes throughout their existence, and the climate itself has also changed wildly throughout this history. It's kind of staggering to ponder the immensity of the difference of the planet's geology between then and now, let alone the life that geology hosted, and the climate that existed above."
AskScience,Does radioisotope migration affect radiometric dating and if so how do we correct for it?,"> They claimed the paper shows how radiometric dating is unreliable, because radioisotopes can be leeched or absorbed which would through off the ratio of daughter to parent isotope.

An important aspect here is that not only are these considering relatively rare areas (i.e., areas influenced by radioactive testing and/or natural reactors like [Oklo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklo_Mine)), they are (1) mostly tracing radionuclides that are not used in radiometric dating and (2) more importantly considering migration into and out of material (i.e., minerals) that are not typically used for radiometric dating. That radionuclides are soluble and thus easily mobilized out of oxides like what this paper focuses on is precisely a reason why many of these minerals are not considered suitable for geochronology. Minerals that we actually use regularly for geochronology (e.g., zircon, monazite, apatite, etc.) are used in part because they tend to be relatively resistant to these kind of effects.

Additionally, the underlying premise seems to be that geochronologists just uniformly accept the assumptions of closed-system behavior when in fact we routinely consider, and test for, open-system behavior as a matter of course in most analyses (e.g., [Schoene et al., 2013](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article/9/1/19/137936/Precision-and-Accuracy-in-Geochronology)). The degree to which we are concerned about open-system behavior, and potential remedies or corrections, depend on the method. We generally expect that U-Pb dating in zircon will reflect closed-system behavior, but still almost always check via measuring both ^(238)U-^(206)Pb and ^(235)U-^(207)Pb ages whereas we expect the possibility of open-system behavior of something like ^(234)U-^(230)Th dating in carbonates is relatively high and do a variety of things to check whether dates are valid or influenced significantly by open-system behavior."
AskScience,What would happen if you made a gigantic sphere of water in space?,"When people say ""water is incompressible"" we mean ""for calculation purposes, you can assume water is incompressible."" However, there is a really easy way to see that water is, in face, compressible- sound travels through water. Sound is sent via compression waves, so if the water could not compress, sound would not travel through it. But water is really hard to compress very much. For instance, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, water is still over 90% of the volume it has on the surface. 

So, put a whole bunch of water somewhere in space (like a whole whole bunch) yes, it would compress and would even start a fusion reaction (it would get hot enough due to compression that the hydrogen and oxygen would break their bond, and the H atoms would start a fusion chain)."
AskScience,"Why is malaria common in the tropics, but uncommon in the US, even though we have lots of mosquitos?","[Malaria was endemic in the Southeastern US prior to the 1940s, when it was eradicated.](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html)  The link is about eradication efforts in the 1940s, but the groundwork was laid in the 30s by the Civilian Conservation Corps.   They did things like installing window screens in people's homes.  Window screens (or bed nets) are quite effective, because sick people are likely to stay in bed.  Not everyone who is contagious with malaria feels like staying in bed, but many do, and keeping mosquitoes away from those people is a huge step toward breaking chains of transmission."
AskScience,Can someone explain how Q is calculated with different fusion systems and why some parts of the energy inputs can be ignored?,"Because you want to know how much goes into the *fuel itself* (deuterium/tritium) vs how much comes out.

So you don't count conversion efficiency at the laser, light lost through absorption and scattering along the way, light that misses the target, conversion to X-rays, X-rays that miss the target, etc.

It's like computing MPG on a car, we don't count crude that leaked from ships, crude lost refining the gas, gas that evaporated at the station, gas spilled on the ground at filling, and gas that leaked from the fuel lines.  We only count the gas that actually makes it to the engine vs the miles you get out."

AskScience,Broadly speaking do all cultures and languages have a concept of left & right?,"So I think you're asking about relative versus absolute directions or wayfinding.

A lot of aboriginal tribes in Australia do this and don't have any relative directions in their vocabulary. They are, not surprisingly, great at directions and have an amazing sense of where north is."
AskScience,Why is the Oort cloud spherical?,"The Sun formed from a collapsing molecular gas cloud, which itself had some net angular momentum. As the rotational velocity of this collapsing gas cloud increased due to conservation of angular momentum, it flattened out into the circumsolar disk.

It was in 1950 that [Jan Oort first suggested](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1950BAN%2E%2E%2E.11%2E%2E%2E91O) that comets originated from a distant, sparse, spherical cloud. He proposed that comets were born in the circumsolar disk, in plane with the planets, before being perturbed by the gas giants and ejected into their spherical distribution. Subsequent studies of the orbits of comets and potential perturbations from passing stars strongly supported the existence of the Oort cloud, which was necessary because it is practically impossible to observe. [J.G. Hills advanced the theory in 1981](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1981AJ%2E%2E%2E..86.1730H), suggesting that there exists an inner Oort cloud, now also dubbed the Hills cloud, that explains the mix of showers of short-axis comets and individual long-axis comets. The Hills cloud would be significantly denser than the Oort cloud, and works like [this one](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1987AJ%2E%2E%2E..94.1330D) used simulations to show first that it is indeed possible to get an Oort cloud from comets formed in the outer planetary region of the circumsolar disk due to combined perturbations by the [galactic tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_tide) and gas giants, and second that the inclination of orbits only becomes random (spherical) beyond 5,000 AU due to the influence of passing stars and gas clouds.

So the much denser Hills cloud, which starts around 3,000 AU, is actually roughly torus-shaped like you expect of the Oort cloud. However the outer Oort cloud, which did likely start out in the orbital plane of the solar system, has probably been scattered by the combined effect of initial scattering by gas giants, and then further perturbation by extrasolar objects."
AskScience,"Can inbred genes be ""fixed"" by stopping inbreeding and starting breeding outside of the gene pool?","It's important to recognize that the ""badness"" of an allele is nothing inherent about it's actual nucleotide sequence, but rather the effect it has on fitness. This might sound pedantic but it's important to recognize because the next step in understanding this is to consider that inbreeding does not and fundamentally cannot *create* bad (aka ""deleterious"") genes. Only mutation can do that, and mutation is random in its occurrence and its distribution in the genome. Therefore, we don't consider known deleterious alleles to be ""inbred genes"", since they arise from mutation no different than any other allele. And since we already know that deleterious genes will (by definition) face selection pressure which reduces their frequency in the population, we see that the force that reduce deleterious alleles in an inbreeding population is exactly the same as the one that reduces them in a non-inbreeding population: natural selection. It is also important to note that populations in many species are heavily inbred with no clear detrimental trends to their fitness.

So, how do these facts all coexist? The answer is that inbreeding can only alter the expression of deleterious alleles which are already in the population, and generally only those that are recessive. In a larger, non-inbred population, there are typically a strong majority of people who do not carry these hypothetical recessive alleles, and so their dominant alleles almost always silence the expression of the deleterious ones for heterozygote carriers. As you decrease the supply of these dominant alleles (usually via cultural behavior like restricting marriages to kin groups), you increase the likelihood that two parents will both be heterozygous carriers of a given recessive allele and produce a homozygous child who expresses the disease. The degree to which this impacts the fitness of that child is of course based on the severity of the disease and how it affects reproduction, but in human societies we sometimes do strange things like effectively cultivating inbred lineages and populations based on wealth, social hierarchies, and out-group exclusion. If a previously inbred population with a trend of recessive genetic disease is suddenly exposed to a larger, non-inbred reproductive pool of partners, you will see those deleterious alleles decrease in frequency commensurate with the magnitude of their impact to fitness. This magnitude reaches its apex in diseases which render the expressing individual sterile, since obviously that lineage is effectively extinct.

There is also the role of a concept called antagonistic pleiotropy, which is where a given allele can have a beneficial effect at one point in the lifespan, but a detrimental effect somewhere else. For example, if we imagine some recessive genetic disease which perhaps makes you resilient to influenza during childhood, but causes severe (or even fatal) respiratory disease in your 40's and onward, this could potentially calculate out to a strong selective advantage because reproduction in the fifth decades and onwards is rare for most humans, whereas infant mortality from infectious disease was almost universally rampant among human populations up until just a few decades ago. In this way, genetic disease can persist in populations because it presents a benefit to fitness at some point in the life history of the carrier which outweighs its cost, and this can even happen across different lifespans in a lineage. Sickle-cell anemia is the classic example of the latter scenario: it is a severely deleterious allele when two of them end up in the same person, but this happens uncommonly enough that the benefit it presents to heterozygotes (substantial resistance to malaria) in the same population outweigh the detriment to these individuals who sadly express the disease."

But if a cell in your embryo that later divided to eventually (after several cell generations) become a sperm (or egg), then yes, they can inherit that.

EDIT:  edited to clarify that it's ""cell generations"".

If any of those cells develop a mutation, it's possible for your child to inherit that change."
AskScience,Why does the parasite have to go through the mosquito for humans to get Filariasis?,"Parasitologist here,

Filarial nematode parasites, like many vector borne diseases, undergo several stages of development in their insect hosts. The microfilariae that are produced from adults have a protective sheath which is sloughed off in the mosquito / fly (for loa loa, onchocerciasis, etc)  midgut after taking a blood meal. These L1 stage worms, as far as we know, do not autoreinfect hosts probably because a) bad for the gene pool, and b) could overwhelm and kill the definitive host. Instead larvae (for lymphatic filariasis) migrate to the mosquito wing muscle, invade cells, and develop twice more to become infectious L3 stage worms which exit the muscle and migrate out onto the skin of the next host the mosquito feeds on. This L3 stage is primed to infect humans.

This kind of parasitism is common since it allows for horizontal transmission between definitive hosts. And if you are a parasite that needs to get to the bloodstream, what better way to get passed around than through a blood sucking insect?"
AskScience,Is there such thing as a cytotoxic memory T cell and if so what is it’s role?,"Cytotoxic T cells are defined by their expression of CD8 in contrast to the CD4 ecpressed by the helper T-cells. After developing a functional T-cell receptor and undergoing selection,  cytotoxic T-cells are in a naiive state and have to come into contact with an corresponding antigen. When they do, they differentiate into one of several different activation states including the cytotoxic effector and cytotoxic memory T-cells. The effector T cells have the highest cytolytic function but are short lived, while the cytotoxic memory T-cells are there to perserve the ""memory"" of the antigen. They are longer lasting and are able to rapidly proliferate and differantiate into the effector cells upon renewed contact with the antigen."
AskScience,Why is Lithium concentrated in some places?,"Not specific to lithium, but for almost any economically viable deposit of metal the answer is segregation processes, e.g., [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/ore_veins/). For lithium, the two largest types of deposits are pegmatites (a type of intrusive igneous rock characterized by very large crystals, often associated with granites) and brines (e.g., [Kesler et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136812001539)). For the concentration of lithium in pegmatites, igneous segregation processes (like in the linked FAQ) are basically the explanation. For brines, these are remnants of lake environments that evaporated down to the point to concentrate a variety of minerals/metals (including lithium) within the remaining fluid and/or evaporitic minerals. Neither of these are in anyway associated with asteroid impacts.

In terms of impacts, there are some examples of impact melts that have produced economically viable metal ore deposits, most notably the Subury impact and the associated Ni-Cu-Platinum group ore body (e.g., [Keays & Lightfoot, 2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00710-004-0050-8)). To be clear, this has nothing to do with the composition of the asteroid itself (i.e., these are not metals from the asteroid), but rather *where* the impact hit and that it had sufficient energy to generate large volumes of melt in a location where, you guessed it, igneous segregation processes within those melts produced a concentration of metals and/or metal rich minerals. Ore deposits associated with impacts are relatively rare and I at least am not aware of any that specifically have viable amounts of lithium in them, but economic geology is not my specialty so maybe someone will provide an example. Suffice to say, even if there is an example, *virtually all lithium ore deposits are not impact related.*"

AskScience,How do X-rays “compress” a nuclear fusion pellet?,"X-ray compression is indeed a physical compression process, just like if you submerged the fuel pellet into a tank of (very high pressure!) water. It is not immediately obvious *why* X-rays should do this to a solid object, though, and I don't think any of the major news articles on the recent NIF shot explain it very well.

The pressure responsible for the fuel compression is called the *X-ray ablation pressure*. When X-rays interact with matter, they deposit their energy into the material. Most of this energy goes into heating the material. X-rays do not penetrate especially *deep* into the material, which means that they dump all of their energy into a very thin (several microns, or less than 1/100th of a millimeter) surface layer. The x-ray pulse is also very short, usually shorter than 10 nanoseconds. The energy density in this surface layer rises very, *very* fast as a result. This produces a two step compression in the target.

1. The rise in internal energy corresponds to a rise in pressure in this surface layer. This is a thermodynamic relationship usually expressed through what we call an *equation of state*. There are a number of commonly used equations of state for high pressure physics; if you are curious to learn more about the underlying math, the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state is a good starting place. 
2. The high pressure in the surface layer pushes surface material *out* and away from the center of the pellet, in the direction of least resistance. This causes a ""recoil"" force towards the center of the pellet, in the form of a compression shock wave. This is the primary source of the pressure required for fusion, *not* the radiation pressure. The radiation pressure from the X-rays is not nearly high enough, but the ablation shock is both high enough pressure and moves fast enough to bring the pellet to ignition.

For more detail on the physics, A.T. Anderson's PhD thesis ""X-Ray Ablation Measurements and  
Modeling for ICF Applications"" is a pretty good and non-paywalled option."

AskScience,What do bacteria living in mechanical ventilation feed on ?,"They don't live in mechanical ventilation. They live in tepid water which has nutrients. Anything with warm water is hazardous.

The first case, where it was identified,  killed a lot of US Legionnaires (armed forces veterans) at a convention at a hotel in Philadelphia. The source was an evaporative cooling tower, which uses evaporating water to discard waste heat from the air conditioning systems.

 The thing about cooling towers is that the water is recycled from a pond in the base of the tower. It collects insects, dust leaves, limescale, etc, nutrients for bacteria. And the water is warm. The bacteria was distributed on the water droplets leaving the tower.

AskScience,"Ask Anything Wednesday - Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology","Is it true that pay transparency laws reduce wages?

Here's the Economist article that makes this claim: [https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/05/pay-transparency-laws-do-not-work-as-advertised](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/05/pay-transparency-laws-do-not-work-as-advertised)

Relevant parts:

>Labour advocates champion pay-transparency laws on the grounds that they will narrow pay disparities. But research suggests that this is achieved not by boosting the wages of lower-paid workers but by curbing the wages of higher-paid ones. A forthcoming paper by economists at the University of Toronto and Princeton University estimates that Canadian salary-disclosure laws implemented between 1996 and 2016 narrowed the gender pay gap of university professors by 20-30%. But there is also evidence that they lower salaries, on average. Another paper by professors at INSEAD, UNC Chapel Hill, Cornell and Columbia University found that a Danish pay-transparency law adopted in 2006 shrank the gender pay gap by 13%, but only because it curbed the wages of male employees. Studies of Britain’s gender-pay-gap law, which was implemented in 2018, have reached similar conclusions.
    
>[...] the effects of 13 state laws passed between 2004 and 2016 that were designed to protect the right of workers to ask about the salaries of their co-workers. The authors found that the laws were associated with a 2% drop in wages, an outcome which the authors attribute to reduced bargaining power. “Although the idea of pay transparency is to give workers the ability to renegotiate away pay discrepancies, it actually shifts the bargaining power from the workers to the employer,” says Mr Pakzad-Hurson. “So wages are more equal,” explains Ms Cullen, “but they’re also lower.”

AskScience,Is there any theoretical limit to how high the Earth's temperature can become within the next 50 years due to global warming?,"Probably the place to start is with the [idealized greenhouse model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealized_greenhouse_model). This is a *very* simplified energy balance model that estimates the average temperature of a planetary atmosphere based on a few parameters, e.g., incoming solar radiation and the radiative forcing in the atmosphere - which can be related to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Now, I'll emphasize again, this is a really simple model as it's not taking into account loads of complexity (e.g., heat uptake by the ocean, atmospheric dynamics, etc.) but doing the simple back of the envelope kind of math as discussed in the wiki page gets you reasonably close to both pre-industrial average temperature and predictions for future temperatures (assuming a given concentration of CO2, more on that in a bit). The main point we can take away from this is that for a fixed concentration of CO2 (or greenhouse gases in general) and other static properties (e.g., fixed solar radiation) there is an expected equilibrium temperature for the atmosphere/surface of the planet. What this model does not include (in addition to all the complexities mentioned previously) is time, i.e., it calculates what that the equilibrium temperature should be when it reaches equilibrium, not how long it would take to get there. This is a critical aspect of anthropogenic climate change, specifically the warming we're experiencing now reflects movement toward an equilibrium temperature related mostly to *past* CO2 concentrations whereas the CO2 we are emitting now is constantly moving the target (upwards) on what that new equilibrium temperature will be in the future.

The above implies that there will be a plateau, eventually, but when it will occur and what it is, is fundamentally unknowable at the moment. This is not because we don't understand the physics or don't have the models to be able to estimate it (we do), but because it fundamentally depends on how much more CO2 and other greenhouse gases we emit in the future. This is the idea behind the standardized [representative concentration pathways or RCPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway), i.e., hypothetical scenarios for CO2 concentration in the future for us to model what happens if we follow that course. Let's consider three of these, specifically RCP2.6 (which envisions that we start reducing CO2 emissions effectively now and have completely phased them out by 2100), RCP6 (emissions peak in 2080 and decline after that), and RCP8.5 (kind of a worse case scenario, where we basically burn all fossil fuels we think exist, about as fast as we can). With this, we can see that even with the worst case scenario, the expected average temperature [by 2100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#21st_century) is ~5C above pre-industrial, which would reflect a **dramatically** different world, but not one that we would expect to be uninhabitable to humans in a physiological sense. That's not to imply that such a change on such a short timescale would not be incredibly disruptive to various aspects of civilization (e.g., agriculture), but the planet is still habitable (kind of a low bar, but it's what you asked about).

With respect to hypothetical plateaus, if we consider [climate projections, out to 2500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#/media/File:Global_mean_near-surface_air_temperature_and_thermosteric_sea-level_rise_anomalies_relative_to_the_2000%E2%80%932019_mean_for_RCP_climate_change_scenarios.webp) we can start to see the differences. For RCP2.6, we've reached the plateau effectively by 2100 and temperatures are stable (and even start to decrease a bit) in a few hundred years. For RCP6, even though emissions peak at 2080, the plateau isn't really reached until sometime between 2400-2500 and settling at something around 4-5 degrees C above pre-industrial. RCP8.5 isn't included in this set, but the plateau would likely be even further into the future and with equilibrium temperature being higher with respect to RCP6. On that graph, you can also see that some effects have even longer delays. For example, even though temperature stabilizes / starts to decrease by 2100 for RCP2.6, sea level is still rising by 2500 (reflecting both continued melting of Antarctica/Greenland and continued heat uptake by the ocean and resulting thermal expansion).

**TL;DR:** For a given, mostly static concentration of greenhouse gases, we do expect there to be an equilibrium temperature (i.e., a plateau), but there is a significant time lag to reach that equilibrium. What those equilibrium temperatures are or when they would be reached is fundamentally uncertain because it depends on how much CO2 we continue to emit, but if we pick a hypothetical scenario, we can answer the question. Even in the most extreme scenario, the vast majority of predictions do not suggest reaching a state where Earth is physiologically uninhabitable by 2100 (or later), but these do suggest a **fundamentally different** world than pre-industrial or even now, which would pose extreme challenges to a variety of aspects of civilization as we know it."
AskScience,"Is there any suspected link between the ~50,000 year old meteor impact craters on Earth?","So first off, let's be precise with the ages. 

For Barringer crater, there are three different age estimates from three independent cosmogenic exposure ages, 49.7 ± 0.85 ka (thousand years), 49 ± 3 ka ([Phillips et al., 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001670379190387K)), and 49.2 ± 1.7 ka ([Nishiizumi et al., 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001670379190388L)) - which all overlap within uncertainty. However, these ages were all done in the pretty early days of surface exposure age dating and we've significantly refined the production rate estimations for these cosmogenic isotopes. Revisiting this data and applying more accurate production rates suggests the age of the crater is 61.1 ± 4.8 ka ([Barrows et al., 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maps.13378)).

For Xiuyan crater, dating is spotty. [Liu et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X12005691) could only constrain that it was older than 50,000 years from radiocarbon (i.e., it was beyond the functional limit of radiocarbon dating). The upper limit of the age is really poorly constrained but broadly considered to be ~5 million years (e.g., [Indu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21004153)).

For the Yilan crater, radiocarbon dates suggest an age of 49.3 ± 3.2 ka ([Chen et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/maps.13711)).

Finally, the Lonar crater is really all over the place. Radiocarbon dates suggested a wide range of 1.79 ± 0.04–40.8 ± 1.1 ka ([Maloof et al., 2010](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/122/1-2/109/125471/Geology-of-Lonar-Crater-India)), fission track produced a pretty ugly estimate of 15 ± 13 ka ([Storzer & Koeberl, 2004](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/1309.pdf)), thermoluminescence dating of impact glass suggested 52 ± 6 ka ([Sengupta et al., 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Debashish-Sengupta/publication/287763263_Lonar_Formation/links/567929dc08ae6041cb49ed7a/Lonar-Formation.pdf)), a Ar-Ar date suggested a much older age of 570 ± 47 ka ([Jourdan et al., 2011](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/39/7/671/130623/40Ar-39Ar-age-of-the-Lonar-crater-and-consequence?redirectedFrom=fulltext)), and a combination of cosmogenic exposure and radiocarbon suggests 37.5 ± 5.0 ka ([Nakamura et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GC005376)). Suffice to say, it's not clear which one of these dates is correct (though Nakamura have a reasonable explanation to rule out the anomalously old Ar-Ar date), but the majority of these do not overlap with the ~50 ka range of interest or more importantly with the ages of any of the other craters we're talking about.

In summary, of the four craters mentioned only really Barringer and Yilan have similar ages and *only* if we use the original (incorrect) ages of Barringer. **Ultimately, none of the ages of these craters overlap within uncertainty**. I'll also just point out a good resource in the form of a compilation of terrestrial impact ages from [Osinki et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825222001969) and a corresponding [website](https://impact.uwo.ca/)."
AskScience,"When the solar system formed, why didn't the heavier elements accumulate at the center, instead of the lightest ones like hydrogen and helium?","The center is only the center because that's where the most material coalesced to create a gravity well. Before that happened, the solar system was a pretty evenly distributed mass of gases and heavy elements.

Slight variations in the distribution of that cloud meant that parts of it condensed together due to gravity, and then drew in more elements, and so on.

Eventually, enough hydrogen and helium collected to ignite a fusion reaction, which made the sun. But it's sort of backwards to say that hydrogen and helium fell to the center. It's more accurate to say that the center is defined as wherever the most hydrogen and helium (and everything else) went.

You're also failing to grasp the scale of the sun. Yes, the sun is 99.9% hydrogen and helium, but the other 0.1% is heavier elements.

That 0.1% weighs more than Jupiter (which is also mostly gaseous). I haven't run the exact numbers, but it seems likely that there is more metal and other heavy elements in the core of the Sun than in the entire rest of the solar system combined.

Edit: did the math.

* Sun: 0.1% heavier materials (1.99E27 kg) *edit: this number might be as high as 2%*
* All inner planets and asteroid belt combined: 1.18E25 kg
* Gas planets: \~8% heavy elements (2.13 E26 kg)
* **Total heavy elements in the sun: 1.99E27 kg**
* **Total heavy elements in the rest of the solar system: 2.25E26kg**

So even using some pretty rough numbers, there's 10 times *(possibly up to 2000 times)* as much heavy material in the Sun as in the entire rest of the solar system."
AskScience,"How does a rock become effectively extinct, and unable to be mined?","So this is a question that would probably do well with a crossover with another sub, like /r/AskHistorians or maybe /r/ArtHistory. So with the caveat that I'm neither a historian or art historian, we can tackle the geological side of this question. Where a historian / art historian would be especially helpful would be providing some background on exactly what qualifies as a *species* of marble in this context. As a term, species (in a non biologic sense) definitely comes up in geology, usually in the context of describing a *mineral species*, i.e., a broad category of mineral (e.g., quartz) that will have a suite of varieties (e.g., amethyst, citrine, etc.). It's not as common (in geology at least) to discuss *species* of rocks, or at least, it's a term that does not have a clear definition in this context (which is a problem for answering the question). 

What I'm going to assume here is that *species of marble* in this context refers to a portion of a marble deposit with a very specific set of criteria, including color, patterning (e.g., from veins or [stylolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylolite)), texture, and other mechanical properties (e.g., how exactly it tends to fracture, how workable it is either in a mining or sculpture sense) etc. All of these details will reflect some mixture of (1) the composition and primary structures within the [protolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protolith), (2) the metamorphic conditions, i.e., the pressure temperature conditions and their duration, that transformed the original limestone or dolomite into a [marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble) (assuming in fact the *species* in question is actually a marble, more on that in a second), and (3) any post metamorphic history that modified the rock volume in question (e.g., the formation of stylolites). Even if we just focus on the protolith, there can be *a lot* of variety because of primary depositional variations, i.e., the type of environment in which a limestone forms can impart a lot of [heterogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone#Description) between, and even within, deposits, which will impart differences in a marble after metamorphosis. It's also worth mentioning, that outside a geologic context, the term marble gets used for rocks that are not actually marbles in geologic sense (sort of how any rock used for a countertop is referred to as a granite, even if it's not geologically a granite). For example, the deposit referred to as the [Red Verona Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Verona_marble) is not actually a marble, it's a limestone.

**The summary** from above is that the unique intersection of original material and geologic history means that you can end up with a lot of variety in marbles (or really, any rock). If a particular body of marble is prized for the very specific set of characteristics (which we assume constitute a *species*), then there will be a finite amount of that marble reflecting those unique conditions. Depending on how specific we get with those characteristics, there may be no other marble deposit on Earth with those exact characteristics, so we can consider that after we've mined out all of that deposit, that *species* of marble is *extinct*, in the sense that there is nowhere else we can find a marble with those exact characteristics. In the broadest sense, while we classify rocks by type (e.g., marble, granite, etc.) most any particular deposit/body of rock will be somewhat unique in some way (and a huge amount of geology centers on understanding the processes that result in, and significance of those, differences)."
AskScience,How quickly are antibodies in blood broken down?,"Antibodies can also be broken down with time, it just takes much longer for it to happen. If you look at an Ig’s structure, it’s made from numerous beta sheets peppered with some post-translational modifications. Both features extend their t1/2 considerably, either because their hydrolysis is kinetically hindered (beta sheets!) or their features and primary structure make them a less desirable substrate for blood proteases (primary structure generally has a considerable effect on t1/2!). 

So depending on the literature, most Igs swim in blood for around 20-25 days in vivo, and it seems to be affected by both the amino acids found in their variable region and the Fc domain. 
This makes sense, so let’s look at our blood sample and suppose it’s stored at room temp - a couple of things will endanger our lovely Ig here: The elevated temperature (-> acid/base catalysed hydrolysis), the change in pH and ionic composition (-> at some point most regularly/buffering mechanisms will fail, K+ will increase and the solution with time will likely acidify if left out on the open. Furthermore, Ig stability appears to be heavily influenced by the serum protein composition (used to be a pitfall in ab engineering using buffered solutions only) which will change over time - so a good bet would be to hypothesise their t1/2 will decrease. The effects of amino acid composition is interesting because different residues have different reactivities which can improve or hamper the ability for ‘self-digestion’. Another aspect, especially with serum osmolarity changing over time, are effects such as aggregation and dispersion of individual Ig molecules. 

A recent paper investigated the effects of sera and buffer composition, especially in regard to the effects above, quite thoroughly trying to mimic physiological conditions as good as possible - however, they used a protein-free buffer to elucidate their initial hypothesis and more importantly improve the analytical accuracy of their protein assays (endogenous serum proteins would certainly interfere with most assays in use today, remedies to this problem are available but at a considerable cost). Now their conclusion was decreased stability of Abs in serum sample over their time for most antibodies investigated, their cut off was met after around 14 days. That being said, their study has numerous ‘downfalls’ in regard to your question. The chemical effects of serum proteins cannot be investigated using their method, the serum composition won’t change in the same way over time as a native blood sample and they said themselves their results were hard to compare with most established methods.

So … let’s summarise for starters: Stability in blood in vivo ~21 days, ex vivo in protein free serum mimic ~14 days. All investigated using engineered antibodies but let’s keep that aside for now. 
Studies for your specific question are scarcer, but most that I have found showed two effects: Initially, stability was decreased and fragments were increasing within 24 hours. However, the presence of their antigen in blood or aggregation increased stability over time. 
Now I wasn’t able to find better literature for your question, but to sum up what I’ve found with what I know I would expect them to rapidly decrease first, and then a steady but slow degradation of the remaining molecules within 10 days. This seems to be in line with the results of one study that examined the stability of SARS CoV 2 IgGs in patient sera which has found the same amount of time. 

For comparison, the lab at the hospital I work at won’t accept Ig-typing from blood samples older than 2 days AND not stored on ice or in a freezer. Of course anything that might lead to therapeutic consequences follows stricter and more conservative rules."
AskScience,"If objects in space are far away, does light get scattered enough that it would look “low resolution” by the time it reaches us?","There's a lot of nothing in space, so not much scattering happens until the light reaches the Earth's atmosphere. The images we get from such telescopes as JWST are ""diffraction limited"", which means that the resolution is a function of the size of the telescope's mirror, in the case of JWST it's the mirror segments that cause the starburst pattern. A huge single-mirror telescope in space could make much higher resolution images."
AskScience,Is there a test to determine one is at risk for Alzheimer’s or if one is in early stages?,"No, full stop.

Because the cause(s) of Alzheimer's are not understood there is no reliable test and in fact Alzheimer's is typically only diagnosed with certainty after death. Modern imaging adds some extra certainty for living patients but diagnosis can only be done for someone actively experiencing symptoms. This is because diagnostic markers that appear in people with Alzheimer's also appear in those without the disease so early diagnosis is extremely questionable at best and downright dishonest at worst. Genetic screens are not going to be a reliable way to assess your risk with any true accuracy for the same reason.

AskScience,"when a limb gets amputated, how do they stop the flow of blood?","Surgeon here:  You wouldn’t want to connect a major artery to a major vein — that would result in high pressure oxygenated blood pouring rapidly into the vein, raising pressure in the venous system and wasting oxygen.  For large blood vessels we tie them off with ligatures (surgical thread, basically) or clip them shut with metal or plastic clips.  Bleeding from smaller vessels is handled with cautery, usually electrocautery or sometimes ultrasonic cautery."
AskScience,"If I had two cups of water, one normal size and one as big as a swimming pool and stirred them both with proportionally sized spoons, would the larger pool of water keep spiraling longer than the smaller?","Yes.  The rate of slowing of the spinning water must be a function of the kinetic energy of the water against the drag of the side walls. 

Even if the max velocity of the water is the same in the pool (ie a very slow rotation rate) then the energy of the water will scale somewhat with the volume of the water, ie cubicly, while the drag of the walls will scale somewhat with the area of the side walls, ie. squared, therefore the larger the cup, the more the kinetic energy of the water outweighs the drag of the sides. 

If you do actually stir at the same rotational rate, then as the other commenter says, the max velocity of the water will be very significantly higher than in the coffee cup, and as energy scales to the square of the velocity then you'll have vastly more energy proportional to drag than in the coffee cup. 

Plus anecdotally, as a kid we used to run around those circular backyard swimming pools and get the water spinning faster and faster, and they kept going for ages!"

AskScience,Why do blood tests measure serum triglycerides?,"Once the blood is drawn it can be manipulated to release the triglycerides and placed in diluents that they are soluble in for measurement. 

Looks like the triglyceride measurement uses lipase enzymes to release the free fatty acids. And then by a series of other reactions a measurable product is generated. 

So it’s not a direct measurement of the triglycerides in the form they are in the body, so solubility in the plasma is not a barrier."
AskScience,Why can my Shop-Vac blow things that are 5 feet away but it can't suck things up that are 5 feet away?,"When you suck, you pull in air from all around which creates a wide circle of negative pressure rather than a column of negative pressure, so the range is short. When you blow, air molecules are being shot straight out and will only slow down once they hit other molecules, so the positive pressure will be in a column resulting in a longer range."
AskScience,How do shifts work on really long medical operations?,"Everyone except for the surgeon gets rotated out.

Usually big long surgeries have 2 surgeons. One is the primary surgeon and the other is assisting. The assisting one may be another attending surgeon or a resident surgeon.

So the patient is never without a surgeon, but surgeons don’t operate through a 36 hour case without a break."
AskScience,How exactly is COPD coorelated to asthma and smoking?,"Smoking is the #1 cause of COPD, as it causes chronic irritation in the lungs, which leads to alveoli getting damaged and mucus plugging. Instead of having lots of good working air sacs and a rubbery lung that expels air well, you get fewer big air sacs and a flabby lung that doesn't breathe out well.

Asthma is an issue of reversible airway constriction, which is to say if someone has asthma, their lungs look healthy when they're not having an attack, unlike COPD. Normally it's just a different problem that you don't need to worry about, though some people do have conditions where features of asthma and COPD overlap."

AskScience,What happens to the energy of sound in space?,If you yell in space the energy goes into the gases that you are expelling as heat.  If you tap a tuning fork in space the energy pretty much stays in the tuning fork as heat until it can be radiated away as infrared.
AskScience,"Peak power production in the Sun has been compared to the volumetric heats generated in an active compost heap. At the center of the Sun, theoretical models estimate it to be approximately 276.5 watts/m3. How can a fusion torus generate a 50,000 times energy than the sun, pound for pound?","The Sun’s fusion process involves the p-p chain, where the fuel is hydrogen; this is a very slow fusion process. Most fusion devices aim to use D-T fusion, where the fuel is deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen). The likelihood of this reaction occurring is much, much higher than the p-p chain. Therefore, the reaction rate in a fusion device would be orders of magnitude higher. Fusion devices also typically have plasma cores with temperatures about 10 times the solar core’s temperature."
AskScience,Where do bacteriophages get energy to inject their genetic material?,"The simplest explanation is that it's like a loaded spring.  Stored energy is released upon a small trigger.  The ""cost"" is pre-paid by the infected cell that produced the phage.  This paper discusses the mechanism for the classic T4 phage: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1909298116"
AskScience,Why is 11km/s said to be the slowest possible impact speed a meteor can have with Earth?,"The earth has an imaginary sphere around it called the Sphere of Influence. This is generally the point where if you drop an object from below that altitude, it will fall to Earth. Above that altitude, and it will orbit the sun. For Earth, this sphere is about 929,000 km above earth. If you drop an object from stationary at that altitude it will fall and pickup 11 km/s of speed before impact."
AskScience,Would spreading sugar on an icy path have the same effect as spreading salt on it?,"Sucrose in anything but nanoparticles dissolves very frustratingly slowly into liquid water at low temperatures, and even slower into ice that it's sitting on the surface of.

That said, sucrose-water solutions do lower the freezing point of the solution, and the saturation of the solution controls the amount of that freezing point depression.

So, granulated sugar onto an icy sidewalk might take hours to work vs. minutes for NaCl. If you poured syrup (a supersaturated solution) onto the ice, it would work pretty quickly meanwhile. Powdered sugar would probably be somewhere in between."
AskScience,How did Argon gas come to be present in the air? Did it arrive on a comet or is it a product of volcanic off-gassing?,"Almost all argon in the atmosphere ([>99%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_argon)) is ^(40)Ar and is thus the product of decay of ^(40)K. It follows then that the relative abundance of argon in the atmosphere reflects that potassium is a pretty common element in the crust (~2% by weight percent), though a relative small fraction ([~0.01%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_potassium)) of that is radiogenic potassium (^(40)K) that will decay to argon (or ^(40)Ca since decay of ^(40)K is a branched decay). The next most common isotope of argon, ^(36)Ar that represents about ~0.3% of all argon on Earth is also in part a product of decay of the cosmogenically produced radiogenic isotope [^(36)Cl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine-36), though given the abundance of ^(36)Ar in the sun (and thus presumably the solar nebula that formed our solar system), not all of this ^(36)Ar reflects in-growth from decay of ^(36)Cl. Small amounts of the third most abundant and stable isotope of argon, ^(38)Ar (~0.06%) can also be produced through reactions of ^(37)Cl with thermal neutrons, but these are relatively rare and don't contribute much to atmospheric argon (e.g., [Eikenberg et al., 1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0016703793900404)).

[Ballentine & Burnard, 2002](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/rimg/article/47/1/481/235410/Production-Release-and-Transport-of-Noble-Gases-in) provide a thorough discussion of production and transport of noble gases, including argon, within the solid crust to the atmosphere. Drawing from this work, if we focus mainly on ^(40)Ar and think about how it gets from a mineral in the crust (or mantle) to the atmosphere after it is formed via decay of ^(40)K, the first step mostly reflects it either diffusing out of a potassium containing crystal or leaking out of the crystal from fractures. Once the argon is outside an individual crystal / at the grain boundary, the primary mechanism for it reaching the surface is through being dissolved in a fluid (e.g., groundwater, magma) and then outgassing to the atmosphere when this fluid reaches/nears the surface. Some amount may diffuse through a rock volume toward the surface, but this is still largely reflecting dissolution in pore fluids and effectively is tracking diffusion through semi-connected pore fluids. Locations where magmatic fluids (e.g., volcanoes) or groundwater (e.g., springs) reach the surface are thus the primary sources of outgassing of argon (and other noble gases)."
AskScience,"Despite the increased incidence of melanoma, does solar radiation increase overall mortality?","According to Dr. Seheult from MedCram continuing medical education, various studies have shown that increased sun exposure *reduces* mortality. See the lecture linked below.

Sun exposure apparently does a lot more than produce vitamin D. see this:

# MedCram | [Light as Medicine: Vitamin D isn't enough](https://youtu.be/5YV_iKnzDRg)

**EDIT** the study that found that increased sun exposure was counterintuitively associated with lower mortality was this:

# Journal of Internal Medicine | [Avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor for all-cause mortality: results from the Melanoma in Southern Sweden cohort](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.12251)

Quote of the abstract:

>**Background**  
>  
>Sunlight exposure and fair skin are major determinants of human vitamin D production, but they are also risk factors for cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). There is epidemiological evidence that all-cause mortality is related to low vitamin D levels.  
>  
>**Methods**  
>  
>We assessed the avoidance of sun exposure as a risk factor for all-cause mortality for 29 518 Swedish women in a prospective 20-year follow-up of the Melanoma in Southern Sweden (MISS) cohort. Women were recruited from 1990 to 1992 and were aged 25 to 64 years at the start of the study. We obtained detailed information at baseline on their sun exposure habits and potential confounders. Multivariable flexible parametric survival analysis was applied to the data.  
>  
>**Results**  
>  
>There were 2545 deaths amongst the 29 518 women who responded to the initial questionnaire. **We found that all-cause mortality was inversely related to sun exposure habits. The mortality rate amongst avoiders of sun exposure was approximately twofold higher compared with the highest sun exposure group, resulting in excess mortality with a population attributable risk of 3%.**  
>  
>**Conclusion**  
>  
>**The results of this study provide observational evidence that avoiding sun exposure is a risk factor for all-cause mortality.** Following sun exposure advice that is very restrictive in countries with low solar intensity might in fact be harmful to women's health.  


**/EDIT**

Vitamin D production is stimulated by UV-B light, but apparently red light, and near infrared light stimulates mitochondrial melatonin. Within the mitochondria melatonin is a potent antioxidant. It doesn't behave the same way as blood plasma melatonin, cannot be increased by supplementation,and is really important for protecting the mitochondria from oxidative damage.

Sunlight also appears to interact with chlorophyll from our diet that ends up in our bloodstream. Blood plasma chlorophyll was found to regenerate co-enzyme Q-10 (ubiquinol /ubiquinone in oxidized form) when exposed to light. Just reasoning from what we know about the function of CoQ10 this effect is suspected to have health benefits.

# Photochemistry and Photobiology | [Dietary Chlorophyll Metabolites Catalyze the Photoreduction of Plasma Ubiquinone](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01230.x)

Chlorophyll has other surprising effects in mammalian cells as well:

# Journal of Cell Science | [Light-harvesting chlorophyll pigments enable mammalian mitochondria to capture photonic energy and produce ATP](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/127/2/388/54610/Light-harvesting-chlorophyll-pigments-enable)

All of these effects factor into whether more sun exposure increases or decreases mortality. It is not merely a matter of cancer.

If I had to guess, I'd say that sun exposure is more beneficial or synergistically beneficial to those who eat a lot of leafy greens."
AskScience,How is the distance an animal can smell calculated?,"Good questions. I cannot imagine how the 18 miles for polar bears scenting an odor was calculated.

From a literature view that I did some years ago, it seems that the smelly molecules basically move on the breeze. They get diluted and moved mainly by air currents and turbulence. See [here](https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/31/2/155/285981?login=false) for how male moths find their females by tracking the plumes of perfume that they emit upwind to their source. 

A quick hunt on Google scholar came up with ""Windscapes and olfactory foraging in a large carnivore"" (2016) (open access), which is about how polar bears sniff out their prey and agrees with my point of view.

As you say the odor will eventually be too dilute to detect, so chemicals that are meant to be detected (like the female' moths perfume) have evolved to be detected by their targets at incredibly low concentrations."
AskScience,Can we selectively breed cows to produce less methane?,"This is actually an area of active research: [Breeding Planet-Friendly Cattle](https://www.ed.ac.uk/impact/research/futureproofing-societies-planet/breeding-planet-friendly-cattle)

Summary: A team led by Alireza Ehsani, a Marie Curie Fellow, is using data and genetics to breed cattle that produce less methane and utilize feed more efficiently. The collaboration with Norway-based global cattle breeding association Geno will simulate 500,000 animals, providing industry credibility. By optimizing feed efficiency and reducing methane emissions, this research could have a significant impact on agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions, which account for about 14.5% of the global total.

Selective breeding and genetic modification are both very slow and expensive processes, so researchers are also experimenting with special feed and additives that can reduce methane emissions.

Some examples:

AskScience,Does rotation break relativity?,"Relativity doesn't say ""all frames of motion are equally valid."" It says ""all inertial frames of motion are equally valid."" That word ""inertial"" is doing a lot of work- it means the reference frame cannot be an accelerating frame. When you're spinning, you are in an accelerated frame, so we do not consider that ""just as valid"" as any other frame. 

Now, that might seem like an arbitrary distinction- but it's really not. The reason is- acceleration can be measured, speed cannot. That is, if you are accelerating, you can perform an experiment/take a measurement that would determine if you were undergoing that acceleration. That is, if you were in a car, accelerating towards a wall, you don't have to say ""I wonder if I'm accelerating towards the wall or the wall is accelerating towards me."" If you're accelerating, you can feel it- you get pressed back into your seat, etc. But if you are moving at a constant speed towards a wall, there is not experiment/measurement you can do which answers ""am I moving towards the wall, or is the wall moving towards me?"" Sure, you might have to say ""man, the wall, the ground, and everything around me is moving towards me"" so in some logical way you could say ""so obviously I'm the one moving"" but there isn't anything that you can do to ""prove"" it. Another way of putting it, accelerations are absolute, speed is always measured in relation to something."
AskScience,How do invasive species manage to propagate in an area without severe inbreeding?,"They don't. Invasive species are often highly inbred.

Inbreeding isn't a magical death ray. Sometimes inbreeding is really bad. Sometimes it's not so bad. There are conditions that can make some populations relatively resistant to inbreeding-related problems (for example, flushing recessives due to long-standing, mild inbreeding). 

>However, it has been suggested that a population can be purged of the genetic load responsible for reduced fitness when subjected to bottlenecks...Following the founder-flush phase, the isofemale lines, with a large flush size and a history of inbreeding depression, recovered most of the fitness lost from early inbreeding, consistent with purging. 

--[Purging of inbreeding depression and fitness decline in bottlenecked populations of Drosophila melanogaster](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00303.x)

Or, the invasive species may suffer from inbreeding depression, but the benefits of a new low-competition environment may outweigh the problems, and the invaders adapt. 

>Specifically, we suggest that a temporary or permanent release from stress in invaded habitats may alleviate the negative effects of genetic depletion on fitness via I × E interactions, and present published empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis. We additionally discuss that I × E interactions can result in rapid evolutionary changes, and may even contribute to adaptation of invaders in the absence of high genetic variation

--[The Genetic Paradox of Invasions revisited: the potential role of inbreeding × environment interactions in invasion success](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12263)

Or, the inbreeding depression may be purged as the invasive species spreads. 

> However, under certain theoretical conditions, bottlenecks of intermediate size can actually purge the alleles that cause inbreeding depression.... Thus, rather than posing a barrier to invasion as often assumed, bottlenecks, by purging deleterious alleles, can enable the evolution of invaders that maintain high fitness even when inbred.

--[Inbreeding depression is purged in the invasive insect Harmonia axyridis](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(11\)00124-2)

And of course, we mainly see the small number of successful invaders. It's very likely that there are many failed invasions that we never notice, because the inbreeding depression prevented a successful new population."
AskScience,Could you make gamma rays via Bremsstrahlung?,"Some of the other comments are about x and gamma rays and where they're from.

AskScience,"Quote from an article on the Guardian news website, ""a single bit of data stored on a mobile phone adds about 10 quectograms to its mass"". Is this an accurate statement, and if so, how does data add mass?","I believe it is an inaccurate statement.  They are misapplying the Landauer Limit which states the theoretical minimum entropy change (and thus energy required) to change a bit of information.  Since energy equates to mass (e=mc\^2), you can frame this energy as mass.  In fact, if you take the value from the wikipedia article (2.805 zeptoJoules) and run it through e=mc\^2, you wind up with 31 quectograms, which is I'm sure where they got the value in the article.

However- this is a theoretical minimum amount of energy (which would be converted to heat) needed to change a bit of information in a perfectly efficient computer.

So wrong for two reasons:

1) Your mobile phone is not nearly this efficient.  By many, many orders of magnitude. 

2) It does not change the mass of the computing device.  The energy came in a low-entropy form from a battery, and converts to a high-entropy form as heat.  The energy is neither created nor destroyed, the mass of the device does not change (until that heat is radiated away, which is a completely separate issue).

AskScience,How fast do bubbles rise in water?,"Bubbles are ellipsoidal in shape, motion is irregular, and velocity is independent of bubble diameter (U is approx. 28 - 30 cm/sec) for bubbles having radii up to 0.75 cm. For larger bubbles their velocity tends to increase to 35 - 40 cm/sec, but they are not stable and tend to subdivide into smaller bubbles.

AskScience,How do cancer vaccines stand out from other strategies with immunotherapy?,"Cancer vaccines are targeted against antigens which only or predominantly exist in cancer cells in order to stimulate the immune system against it. Often this is done by introducing RNA, coding for the respective antigen(s). There are two major hallmarks that make this a complicated task.

a) it is far from trivial to choose the correct antigen(s). Besides them really needing to be specific for the cancer, you also face a rapidly mutating environment and massive differences between patients. This is also why personalized therapies are a thing (like biontechs inest approach) in development. This is in top of cancer being not one single illness, but hundreds.

b) you need to deliver a substantial amount of the antigen coding RNA via the correct route, also targeting the correct tissue etc. This is far from trivial, since you at best want to be precise, but end up rather systemic with nuances.

These two things are not that complicated in, let's say, infectious diseases, such as COVID, where you have a pretty distinct target (like spike) and also can be pretty systemic with the administration."
AskScience,"Do all sounds travel at ""the speed of sound"" or are some sounds faster than others?","The general phenomenon you're asking about is called [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_dispersion). There is a small amount of dispersion for sound waves in free air, but it's not much at all in the normal regime. It gets stronger in the ultrasound and for sounds that are loud enough to start seeing nonlinear effects.

Since most sounds we hear are broadband, the effect is less that some sounds travel faster than others, and more that a sound will get smeared out a bit so that different frequencies of the original sound will arrive at slightly different times."
AskScience,"Why, when you continue to burn ash, do the ashes eventually change from black to white?","If you have something black during a combustion process that‘s not ash but the remaining carbon. The carbon reacts with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide, a gas. Ash is the product of oxygen reacting with everything not containing carbon: calcium, magnesium, and a few other metals. The oxides of those metals (reaction products with oxygen from the air) are usually white in color and do not become gaseous at usual combustion temperatures. That is why this is what‘s left at the end of burning something and why it is white."
AskScience,can gemstones be melted into a gradient?,"Fun idea, but minerals don't work like that. First, some basic mineralogy stuff. [Amethyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst) is just dirty [quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz) and [sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire) is just dirty [corundum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum), i.e., amethyst is a quartz crystal that has impurities (usually iron, but sometimes other metals) and sapphire is a corundum crystal that has impurities (for a blue sapphire, typically iron and titanium). For reference, there are other color sapphires (with different elements subbing into the crystal lattice, producing different colors) and we give other names to corundum with different impurities (e.g., if corundum has chromium in it, it will tend to have a red color, which we call a ruby). 

So lets say you take some amethyst (quartz - SiO2 - with some Fe) and sapphire (corundum - Al2O3 - with some Fe and Ti) and put them into a crucible, how hot would you need to get them to melt? Well, quartz ~~(for a rock forming mineral) melts at relatively low temperature of around ~570 C (assuming we're basically doing this at atmospheric pressures)~~ EDIT depending on the type of quartz and the duration of heating, will melt at ~1750 C (e.g., [Folstad et al., 2023](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/2/132)), but we need to get our mixture up to ~2000 C to melt corundum. Let's say you have the right equipment to do that and you get both your amethyst and corundum into a melt, you've basically made a ""melt"" consisting of Si, Al, O, Fe, and Ti (assuming that the amethyst was an amethyst because of Fe and not some other metal). 

If you start cooling this melt, what's going to happen? Well, you'll start to crystallize things, and effectively you'll crystallize things in the reverse order. I.e., whatever melted ~~first~~ EDIT: last - will start to crystallize first. So in a super simple scenario, as the temperature of our mixture drops below ~2000 C, you might start to get bits of sapphire to crystallize. This is effectively a reflection of one of the basic things we teach in an intro geology class,  i.e., [Bowen's reaction series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen%27s_reaction_series), which basically is a progression of minerals you'd expect to crystallize out of a melt containing a mixture of common mineral forming elements (or in reverse, what order you'd expect minerals within a rock to melt as you ramp up the temperature). This progression effectively relates back to the melting/crystallization temperature of different minerals, but also the evolution of a melt, i.e., when a particular mineral crystallizes from a cooling melt because it is thermodynamically favorable to do so, depending on what constituents it ""takes up"", the composition of the melt will change.

With that in mind, and returning to our specific example, importantly, you've got a melt that has some extra components compared to your original sapphire, namely Si, so chances are you might not even get sapphire (or corundum) back, for example, you might start to instead crystallize an [aluminosilicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminosilicate), i.e., Al2SiO5, specifically probably [andalusite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusite) since we're doing this experiment at atmospheric pressures) or some other minerals depending on the exact mixtures and conditions as you reduced the temperature. As you continue to cool the melt, finally, you'd probably get quartz, basically using up what ever Si and O were left. Whether this quartz looked anything like amethyst would depend on whether the minerals that crytallized before it had left any iron around. Effectively, what you've done is made an artificial rock, i.e., a mixture of one or more minerals but where the individual minerals are distinct crystals. Also of note, it tends to take relatively specific conditions to grow large crystals that we could consider ""gem quality"", and chances are, our experiment would not result in this, but instead a relatively fine grained rock with lots of little crystals, so probably not a very pretty rock. 

You also might be asking, instead of cooling our melt slowly and letting crystals form, what if we cooled it really quickly, i.e., if we ""quenched"" our melt? Well, then you've basically formed glass. Chances are it's going to look basically like [obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian), which is a natural form of glass from rapid cooling of melts rich in silicon, oxygen, and aluminum (along with some other bits) kind of like our melt.

Finally, it's worth noting that the material properties for minerals and metals tend to be *very* different. Those differences in material properties allow metals to be ""worked"", i.e., you can deform them in a ""ductile"" manner even at low temperature and pressure to form things like rings. At atmospheric temperatures and pressures, most naturally occurring minerals instead deform ""brittlely"", i.e., they fracture. So, you would not really be able to form a mineral into something like a band, unless you had a single crystal large enough to just cut a ring shaped object out of this crystal. You can get minerals to deform in a ductile manner, but it takes relatively intense temperature and pressure conditions to do so and not exactly something you can do in your kitchen, unless for some reason you have a [diamond anvil cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell) in your kitchen.

**EDIT:** For all the people asking me various forms of, ""what if you did this other kind of manufacturing technique on minerals/resin/other stuff to get the desired effect?"" this is a fundamentally different question than ""can you melt two minerals together."" The former question is relevant for what OP wants, but  is not really for a geologist to answer (i.e., most of us are not professional jewelers, oddly enough). I.e., stop asking me how to make jewellery, I don't know how to make jewellery."
AskScience,Do lakes have a minimum depth for a given surface area?,"In short, no. The average, minimum, or maximum depth of a lake will reflect the interplay of a set of different controls:

1. Shape of the basin containing the lake and the origin of that basin. The underlying shape (of the ""basement"" at least) will be different depending on tectonic setting, e.g., a lake basin might be very asymmetric in cross section if it forms in a [half graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-graben) whereas it might be more symmetric if it forms in a [graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graben). Also critical is the elevation of the lowest area containing the lake, i.e., the rim. The total height of the surface of the lake will be limited by the lowest point along the rim (if the lake fills above this point, it will spill into the adjacent lowland).
2. The combination of rate of sediment influx into the lake, which will largely be a product of the rate of uplift and erosion of the areas around the lake, and the rate of subsidence of the lake bottom. Together these control how much space there is for water, e.g., if sediment flux is very high but subsidence is very low then sediment will be filling up most of the space that could be occupied by water.
3. The combination of discharge into the lake and evaporation off the lake (and other forms of loss, e.g., groundwater infiltration). This will depend on the climate of the area immediately around the lake (mostly for the evaporation bit) and the climate of the catchment area of the lake, which depending on the details could be very different than that of the lake. E.g., consider a large lake like the Caspian where its catchment area is very large and the climates within the catchment area are pretty varied.

So, from above, we could certainly get an estimate of expected depths if we have values for all these parameters, but it's not going to be a simple proportionality between surface area and depth. We can see this with natural lakes, e.g., [Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal) has a pretty small surface area but is very deep where as the [Caspian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea) has a pretty large surface area but is not that deep (in the modern at least). The differences between these reflect differences in the parameters above (e.g., the rate of subsidence in Baikal is very high whereas the rate of sedimentation into the Caspian is pretty high, etc). While simple averages for the various inputs will get you close for a given lake, pretty much all of these parameters vary through space and with time, so it gets messy, very quickly. 

If anyone wants a deep dive into some of these controls, there are a suite of kind of classic papers from the late 90's early 2000's covering the interesting dynamics of lakes (e.g., [Carroll & Bohacs, 1999](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/27/2/99/207139/Stratigraphic-classification-of-ancient-lakes), [Bohacs et al., 2000](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/aapg/books/book/1304/chapter-abstract/107164492/Lake-Basin-Type-Source-Potential-and-Hydrocarbon), and [Bohacs et al., 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/519/chapter-abstract/3801181/Lessons-from-large-lake-systems-Thresholds)). Several of these contain specifically plots of things like area vs maximum depth (e.g., Figure 1 of Bohacs et al., 2003) that show no meaningful simple relationship. You can kind of define relationships between volume and maximum depth or volume and area (the other panels of that figure), but they're pretty bad in terms of prediction with depth vs volume being the best, but with *a lot* of scatter.

**EDIT** To add specifically something about the aspect of the question with relation to whether there is a minimum depth where the lake would not persist and/or expectations for surface area to depth relationships as a lake dries up. This has less specifically to do with depth and more to do with the average precipitation/evaporation ratio. If this ratio is greater than 1, you would broadly expect the water volume to increase, if it equals 1 the water volume would stay roughly constant, and less than 1 the water volume would decrease until the lake drys up. The linked sources again have plots of P/E ratios vs a variety of physical characteristics (area, volume, depth) and again show effectively no relationship. Of course, for a lake with a P/E < 1, this by definition would be an *ephemeral* feature assuming the P/E stays < 1, so the depth of the lake will gradually decrease until it is zero. The way the average, max, minimum depth scales with surface area as the lake volume decreases will be a function of the shape of the basin containing the lake, so you would only expect a universal relationship if the bathymetry of all lakes were the same (they're not, so you do not expect a single relationship). More specifically, if we take a look at models used to estimate evaporative potential for a lake (and thus a control on the P/E ratio) like those discussed in [Morton, 1983a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169483901774), and [Morton, 1983b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169483901786), you'll see that lake depth is not formally considered. In detail, it plays a role of sorts in that for ""shallow lakes"" (where what constitutes shallow is not made particularly clear in these papers) depth is not considered at all, whereas for ""deep lakes"", depth does play a role as you have to account for heat storage within the water column. Since OPs question is specifically about a minimum depth, the ""shallow"" lake case is probably more relevant and in these, depth is not necessary to consider in terms of evaporation, only climatological/atmospheric details.

**EDIT 2** For all of the people arguing about semantics, there is no formal definition in terms of physical dimensions that defines something as a *lake* as opposed to another name for a water body filling an enclosed topographic depression, so this is not a particularly useful path to go down in terms of trying to answer OPs question."
AskScience,Do all the world's oceans mix?,"Yes, on sufficiently large timescales- provided that it isn't something that's affected by biochemical cycling.

What u/funwithdesign says regarding the ocean being sectioned off by currents is true to an extent, but surface and deep water do mix, and the whole thing cycles on a thousand year (or so) timescale. There have been studies on ocean mixing, since surface currents and water exchange with the deep ocean have a profound effect on both local and global climate. It turns out that radioactive isotopes (from nuclear testing) are good tracers for this kind of thing.

I encourage you to search for AMOC- the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Curculation- and the older name for it, ""thermohaline circulation"" to explore the topic of ocean mixing."

Way back with Arisistotle it was basically thought that the “earth” element pulled things towards the center of the universe. 

From there many individuals separately began to describe this attractive force that pulled stuff to the earth, and even began to calculate/quantify it. 

So it’s not really true that Newton came up with the idea of a “gravitational force” in the sense of some sort of law of nature that made apples fall from trees. 

What Newton did was develop a law of universal gravitation that could actually be applied to everything. At least everything up until we started seeing relativistic effects. 

His mathematical equations/proofs showed that the same force that made apples fall to the earth was what made the planets move, and that the force was at least correlated with mass. Prior to Newton the two were not unified, and many thought they were separate phenomena."
AskScience,Why do giraffes have spots?," I was driving down a narrow road in Kruger National Park at about 70 kph when all of a sudden I realized the trees on each side of the road were filled with giraffes. They blended in so perfectly we never saw them until we were next to them. It scared us to death because if one had stepped out into the road it would have been very bad. 

So, yes. Can confirm. Camouflage."
AskScience,Were all dinosaurs feathered?,"Wikipedia has a pretty good [graphic/summary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur).
We've found feathers or proto-feathers in theropods such as yutyrannus; in ornithiscians such as psittacosaurus, heterodontosaurs, kulindadromeusn and feather analogues in several pterosaurs. It is most likely that the genetics to produce these filaments is ancestral to the entire group. The feathered fossils we have found all belong to fairly basal animals of different groups, further supporting this.
Feathers and scales are developmentally related (see the scutes on bird feet) so there would have likely been a huge amount of variation. Dinosaurs like psittacosaurus had a small and specific row of fuzz, probably for display, while heterodontosaurus had pretty extensive coverage. Larger species are less likely to have full coverage due to body heat. Nanuqsaurus and pachyrhinosaurs have no known feathers but are usually depicted with them due to their environment. Many skin impressions preserve definite scales and scutes. But the presence of scales doesn't necessarily rule out feathers, which are likely to be lost during decomposition.
  
So while all dinosaurs likely had the capacity to be feathered, many were probably not in any noticeable way."
AskScience,Extremely large animals~ were trees and plants just as large?,"Ferns grew as tall as trees, those do exist in the fossil record. And even today there are some trees that grow to be hundreds of feet tall.

More recently, in the age of the megafauna (giant sloth, mastodon, etc) the trees were similar to what we see today and had fruit specifically adapted to be eaten by those megafauna. That's why all around North America there are trees that bear large fruit that are inedible to humans. They used to be eaten by animals that don't exist.

Look into the book ""Ghosts of Evolution"" for a really in-depth look into how plants evolved to species that no longer exist. Really fascinating read."
AskScience,Is there a maximum energy of a photon?,"There's no maximum energy of a photon. Energy is frame dependent, so you can always pick a reference frame in which any photon has an arbitrarily high energy.

In practice, a photon with more than a few PeV of energy (a few thousand TeV), with respect to the cosmic rest frame, would have difficulty getting anywhere in our universe because it would scatter off cosmic microwave background light to produce electron-positron pairs."
AskScience,How do ant colonies circulate air?,"Ants don't really need that much of oxygen at all, only a tiny amount.  You could put a colony in a sealed jar and it would take months, if not years for them to exhaust the oxygen (assuming they had enough food and water).  Some species intentionally plug the entrances to their nest when faced with flooding, letting the colony survive on just the oxygen in the tunnels, then switching to anaerobic respiration, requiring no oxygen, to hold out for a bit longer.

That being said, RE: circulation, it's basically just natural circulation.  Since they're ""cold blooded"", they don't really generate much heat (and can easily just stop metabolizing if they need), but the small amount that they (and their larvae) do generate is probably more than enough to get micro-convention currents going, pulling fresh ever so slightly colder air down into tunnels, just enough for their oxygen needs."
AskScience,Can the back action propagation in a neuron spread from the dendride to the axon of another neuron through the synapse?,"I haven't heard of a case where depolarization wave can jump from a dendrite to an axon however some neurotransmitter systems can act in retrograde, that is from postsynaptic neuron to presynaptic one. These systems include endocannabinoid system, and nitric oxide and nerve growth factor molecules. This transmission doesn't cause depolarization, it remains a chemical cascade inside the neuron."
AskScience,"I keep reading comparisons of todays weather to previous time periods, where it says that its the hottest month since some years ago. So was it just as hot or hotter before? If global warming is the cause today, what caused it to be that hot a 100 years ago? Why is today so much worse?","When you read that July 2023 has been the hottest month of July since measurements began in 1880, it doesn't mean July 1880 was remotely as warm as July 2023. It means that we were not measuring temperature everywhere systematically before 1880, so we don't have the data before that, that's it.

So we have to use other methods to go further back in time. Some model may be used to model historical climate and say that the hottest day this year was hotter than any other day in the past 100,000 years. Again, this is due to the limits of the model that was used, it cannot go back in time further than that. It doesn't mean that 100,000 years ago there was a super hot day...

That's it really. Unless you go back in time far enough to reach a point at which the poles had a tropical climate, millions of years ago. But plants and animals were completely different back then, so it doesn't tell us much about our possible survival.

AskScience,What exactly is smell?,"As humans we have about 400 unique receptors which molecules (“odorants”) can bind to one or more and activate them. When activated, in concert, we perceive a smell or rather a unique signature which we associate with items. 

Smell originates from this chemical binding and later electric signal generation.

Evolutionarily, single celled organisms use a process called chemotaxis to navigate to greater concentration of certain molecules to get to a food source so it’s no wonder that similar mechanisms persist in larger creatures."

AskScience,How do medicines like Aspercreme work to relieve nerve or muscle pain if they are topical and not transdermal?,"Drugs when applied topically can absorb systemically. For products like Aspercreme, however, they only need localised effect, so they don't need to get into systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. They just need to cross through the skin and into the local area (i.e., muscle). They passively absorb through the skin via two ways: 

1. transcellularly, where they cross through the cell membrane and through the skin cells, or

2. paracellularly, where they cross in junctions between cells.

For the latter, there are excipients like ethanol or glycerin (which is found in Aspercreme) that can help open up these junctions to facilitate paracellular diffusion through the epidermis. Thick ointment formulations also help in the same way. The active drug, salicylate, won't help with nerve pain but it can provide a localised anti-inflammatory effect -- the advantage with localised effect is the drug compound itself doesn't need to be so potent. Nonetheless, the active drug still has to have some favourable physicochemical properties -- it has to be highly lipophilic, but still sufficiently hydrophilic, to cross transcellularly, and it needs to have a small molecular weight to fit through functions, etc. The use of a triethanolamine salt for salicylic acid also helps, as it helps to stabilise the drug (think of it as the rocket that propels the shuttle before detaching). [Triethanolamine salicylate has been shown to perfuse tissue.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6334699/)

Interestingly, methylsalicylate is another form of salicylic acid used in topical preparation. There are enzymes called esterases in the skin that will cleave up molecules by their ester linkages. Methylsalicylate contains an ester group that gets hydrolysed by these esterases when absorbing, turning into the active salicylic acid."
AskScience,How do we know there is no Planet 9/X?,"We don't need the hypothetical planet to complete an orbit, we just need other planets/objects in the Solar system to complete theirs. 

We have extraordinarily accurate orbit propagators (aka- software which takes a current location of an object in the Solar system and predicts where it will be in the future), which account for the locations of all of the planets as well. So, for instance, we track Mars' orbit, and Mars' orbit is affected by the locations of the other planets. If there was another planet somewhere, that we just didn't know about, our predictions would be wrong.

This isn't really new either. [It was the method we used to predict both Neptune and Pluto existsted](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/physics/astrocourses/ast201/pluto_tombaugh.html). Sure, with our more crude measurements back then, we were a little off (Pluto was originally predicted to be 11 times larger than Earth, for instance), but its location was predicted just by looking at how Neptune was orbiting- even though even since Neptune was discovered, ~~it still hasn't completed a single revolution around the Sun~~ it completed it's first full revolution around the Sun just in 2011. It just wasn't moving *quite* right.  

On a side note, I first realized how important this was early in my career when I got to use the orbit propagator used to plan the Apollo missions. To plan the burns to go from the Earth to the Moon, the propagator had to know the locations of several other planets (it didn't actually care about all of them- the effects were still there, but smaller than the best control we could have, so we didn't bother). So yes, even though the effect was small, we would get different answers based on whether or not Jupiter was near or far from us during the mission time.

**Edit:** was corrected below about Neptune completing an orbit. My learned in college fact is now outdated."
AskScience,"How can this substance ""Allkaline pyrogulic acid"" be acidic and basic at the same time?","The term isn’t saying it’s both acidic and basic, it’s referring to an alkaline salt of pyrogallic acid, most likely the sodium salt. It’s the conjugate base of pyrogallic acid. The term is most likely traditional, coming from some industry that uses it a lot and has called it that for ages even though something like “sodium pyrogallate” might make more sense. 
Also, usually that type of terminology is used for carboxylic acids like benzoic acid and sodium benzoate, but pyrogallic acid isn’t a carboxylic acid so calling the conjugate base “pyrogallate” may not be chemically appropriate."
AskScience,Antiviral medications - What are their different traits and applications in real life scenarios?,"Antibiotics don't ""nuke everything"", but you are correct in that they are much more indiscriminate in what they ""kill"" than antivirals are.  One reason for this is the relative complexity of bacteria compared to viruses. Bacterial genomes are far larger, and code for far more proteins than viruses do.  Add to this the fact that bacteria are alive and able to replicate on their own, while viruses rely in large part on the machinery of the infected cells to make more viruses.

For example, tetracycline in a broad spectrum (meaning effective against many different types of bacteria) which stops bacterial protein production by irreversibly binding to bacterial ribosomes (the part of any cell responsible for making new protein).  However, bacterial ribosomes are different enough from human ribosomes that your cells happily keep making protein, while the bacteria can't and die.   Nearly all bacteria have the same ribosomal structure so it works well against a lot of different bacterial species.

However, viruses don't have ribosomes.  They infect your cells and use your ribosomes to make their protein.  An antiviral which stops viral protein synthesis in the same way as tetracycline stops bacterial protein synthesis (by binding to and blocking the means of production) would assuredly kill the virus, but you would be dead also as your body would be unable to make new proteins.

Instead, many antivirals are designed to target a specific virus.  I'll use your herpes/acyclovir example above.  Acyclovir acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis and is a type of molecule known as a nucleoside analog.  That means it looks sort of like a molecule which is used in DNA synthesis, but has important parts missing.  The enzymes humans use to synthesize DNA are sophisticated enough to realize that acyclovir is a ""fake"" and doesn't use it in DNA synthesis.  However, herpesviruses have their own version of this enzyme that doesn't realize acyclovir is a fake and happily utilize it to make new DNA.  However, acyclovir is missing a part of the molecule that is required to add the next base in the chain, and therefore DNA synthesis stops.  Yes, this can affect the infected cell also, but it is infected with a virus and is doomed anyway.

Fun fact-there are 8 distinct human herpesviruses, and as far as I know acyclovir works against most if not all of them.

BUT-because viruses evolved much differently than bacteria, other viruses use much different strategies than herpesvirues do to make new DNA, and therefore acyclovir (or any drug in ""cyclovir"" family) do not work on viruses outside of herpesviruses.

There are antivirals, such as interferon, which work by targeting your immune system rather than the virus directly.  These types of drugs serve to ""supercharge"" your immune system.  An increase in interferon is like an alarm on a military base.  It tells your immune cells there is a problem (infection) somewhere and they by God better muster up, make more immune cells, and spread out around the body and figure out what the problem is."

AskScience,Where is it possible to find Earth surface geometry data?,"I'm going to guess by ""geometrical info for the surface of the Earth"" you mean topography? By far the most standard way this data is available is as digital elevation models (DEMs) which are gridded rasters where each ""pixel"" in the raster stores the bare earth elevation representative of the footprint of that pixel. DEMs are distinct from digital surface models (DSMs), where DSMs are typically also rasters storing single elevation values representative of that pixel, but where that elevation includes buildings, trees, etc. There are also digital terrain models (DTMs), but this is *usually* just another way of referring to a bare earth DEM. A variety of global and regional DEMs exist with a wide array of resolutions (i.e., pixel footprint size). A pretty commonly used global one is SRTM (shuttle radar topography mission) that is released with either a nominal 90 m or 30 m grid size, but there are a variety of others (ALOS, Copernicus, etc.). There are some global DSMs as well (e.g., the Copernicus data is releases as either a DSM or a bare earth DEM where ""non-ground"" data has been removed/patched). Whether a DEM or DSM, these are usually provided in one of a few different file formats, typically GeoTIFFs. GeoTIFFs can be converted to stl files in a variety of programs.

In terms of actual point clouds, it's uncommon to release global data this way. There are specific areas for which lidar surveys have been done where point cloud data is available, but it's still more common to access the gridded DEM or DSM produced from those point clouds. 

There are lots of different data clearinghouses for these datasets. A convenient one that has both global and regional gridded and point cloud datasets is [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog?group=global)."
AskScience,"If a virus was completely asymptomatic, genuinely having no effect on it's hosts-- would we even know it exists?","I might blow your mind but these kinda actually do exist. Our DNA is riddled with DNA from ancient viruses that infected our ancestors. At some point in the past these viruses became permanently incorporated into our genetic material. It's also theorized that these fragments pay an important part in evolution.

We realized these existed from studying our genetic sequence and noticing patterns in it that were almost identical to those found in viruses. And since these don't actively make new virus molecules they are as asymptomatic as it gets."
AskScience,Why does the elevation of Greenland sink to near or below sea level in the center?,"I assume you're asking about the surface elevation of the topography beneath the ice sheet, like those constrained in papers like [Morlighem et al., 2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL074954)? In short, the reason for the below sea level elevations are the mass of the ice and the [isostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy) response of the crust to this mass. 

In detail, the Earth's crust behaves somewhat like a giant elastic sheet. When a surface load, like an ice sheet, is placed on the crust, it deflects downward analogous to how if you put a weight on the center of a trampoline, the surface of the trampoline would deflect downward by an amount proportional to the mass, the distribution of that mass, and the 'rigidity' of the trampoline itself. The added extra complication is that in the analogy, the trampoline is the crust and the air is the mantle, but in reality the mantle is *extremely* viscous, so the flexural response to a mass is not instantaneous (like it effectively is in the trampoline example, because air can flow out of the way beneath the trampoline *very* quickly), i.e., it is dictated by both the elastic properties of the crust, but also the viscosity of the mantle as the mantle has to flow (*reminder* the mantle is a solid, but behaves like a fluid on long timescales, i.e., it's a [rheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheid)) away from the depression to accommodate the deflection. Similarly, when the surface mass is removed (or reduced), there will be an isostatic/flexural response, i.e., the surface elevation will 'rebound'. When this is discussed in reference to reduction of ice sheet mass, this is described as [glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) or 'glacial rebound'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound). Because of the moderating effect of the high viscosity of the mantle (i.e., it takes time for the mantle to flow back to allow for rebound), GIA is actually still occurring from large ice sheet reductions during the end of the last glacial period, and we can [measure the vertical rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound#/media/File:PGR_Paulson2007_Rate_of_Lithospheric_Uplift_due_to_post-glacial_rebound.png) at which the Earth's surface is still rebounding in response to melting of the large northern hemisphere ice sheets."
AskScience,What determines whether we can create a vaccine for an illness or not?,"HIV is like a rootkit on the software of your immune system: it destroys the very cells that would be sent to destroy it. That's why it's so hard to vaccinate against. Fortunately, we have very effective treatments to suppress it and we can, *if we deploy these widely enough*, expect to suppress it out of transmission in the foreseeable future. HIV isn't very easy to transmit so if you suppress it in the people who have it, it should die out when the oldest person with HIV dies of other causes, after spending their life with suppressed HIV.

Herpes is a sneaky bastard that hides out in nerve cells, out of the way of the immune system. The immune system can deal with it if it can find it, so that's why it hides.

Note that the work to be able to create a Covid vaccine has been in progress for decades. BioNTech (the actual inventors of the ""Pfizer Covid vaccine"") was founded 15 years ago and the more fundamental research on mRNA vaccines was done before the company was founded.

A huge amount of this understanding of viruses comes from the ability to sequence genomes. This is almost magical - it really is science fiction come to life. It's as magical as the ""Star Trek communicator"" becoming ""cellphone in your pocket, works worldwide"". The Human Genome Project required rooms full of thousands of expensive machines working for several years to sequence one genome. Today, you can do a full sequence of a human-size genome in less than a day (current record: 5 hours 22 minutes!). You can grab a random virus or bacterium and sequence it overnight, just to see what's interesting in its genome. If you find another one tomorrow, you can compare them over the weekend. This is a huge change for all life sciences.

It was sheer luck that mRNA technology was almost advanced enough to make vaccines for coronaviruses when SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) showed up. A lot of researchers worked a lot of overtime to turn ""almost"" into ""actual"" in an amazingly short time.

We also have a lot of experience making vaccines to viruses that the immune system can handle when suitably primed (i.e. NOT retroviruses like HIV, but most others) in other ways - using similar virus strains, culturing viruses and inactivating them, weakened live viruses, and so on. These methods had been used to produce vaccines for the SARS virus (the vaccines were not widely tested because by the time they were ready, there were too few cases to test and no need for them). The same techniques were also used to produce SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

We can expect a lot more vaccines for diseases previously considered impossible to vaccinate against, using mRNA technology.

Aside from mRNA tech, research continues on other diseases. RSV (Respiratory syncitial  virus) is a serious disease for infants, but attempts to make vaccines were disastrous in the past and the reason why the first attempts failed has only recently been understood after 30 years of work. This work doesn't even use mRNA knowledge, it's completely separate innovation.

Virology and immunology are both extremely complex topics which we have, across the world, not nearly mastered. We do not understand either, not even nearly, so the rate of advance of knowledge is rapid in both. When they intersect, they are both even more complicated. You have to see the current state of vaccines as a work in progress, where some problems have been solved and others have not, depending on random chance and whatever seems most important at the time.

I'm nearly 50 years old. In my lifetime, we have gone from commonplace vaccines for only a few things - polio, etc - to vaccines for a whole array of nasty diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, diptheria, typhoid, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcus, influenza (moving target, alas), etc).

I expect in 50 more years, we'll have zapped most of them."
AskScience,How does our sense of taste differ from other species?,"Different species are adapted to detect different chemical compounds, according to the foods they generally eat (and what compounds those food species evolved to produce to avoid being eaten.)

Cats purportedly do not taste 'sweet' things as such- they lack the receptors for it, as obligate carnivores with little need for detecting sugars or starches.

Capsaicin, the main(?) compound for spiciness, was developed specifically as a defense against being eaten by mammals, since our mastication and digestion renders pepper seeds unable to sprout, where avian digestive properties do not. Birds can taste this compound, but have no adverse reaction to it- so the relevance of this example depends whether you consider the burning part of peppers to be part of their flavor."
AskScience,"I read that one of the issues with desalination plants is the potentially toxic brine waste product. Could this be used for other purposes, possibly for reactor coolant? Or at least safely stored away like we do with nuclear waste?","So it might help to understand the process here and why we end up with brine instead of salt.


So first, desalination at large industrial scales is done via reverse osmosis. This process is basically pushing cleaned seawater up against a membrane. The water can pass through the membrane, but the salt dissolved in the water cannot.

This is much more efficient process than desalination via boiling and condensation. However, it also gets harder and harder to remove only the water from a liquid as the salt concentration increases. For example, if you have a gallon of seawater, separating one cup of pure water from the gallon is easy. But you are left with the same amount of salt in less than 1 gallon of water. The second cup is harder to extract, and makes the remaining liquid more salty. This is why we end up with brine instead of the pure solid salt that you might end up with if you were boiling or heating the water to desalinate it by distillation. 


If, like you suggested, we wanted to use the salt for other purposes, such as using molten salt in a reactor, it would need additional processing. You would have to first remove the rest of the water, and then purify the salt. This would take quite a lot of energy and additional money.


But it could be done. The problem is how much water flows through desalination plants, and how much salt that would make.

The largest desalination plant can produce 1 billion litres of water a day. Let us assume we are 100% efficient and use up 1 billion litres of water (in reality, more seawater would be needed to make 1 billion litres of freshwater).

1 litre of water has ~35 grams of salt. That means the desalination plant could produce 35 thousand metric tons of salt a day. Or, over 12 million metric tons of salt a year.


How much salt is that?


The entire US used approximately 59 million metric tons of salt in 2022. That means, a single desalination plant would produce about 20% of the countries salt needs. However, the  US uses over 300 billion gallons of water per day. So, in order to create enough water for only 1.5% of our water needs, we would create approximately 100% of our salt needs.


Simply put, it is ALOT of salt. Trying to just store the salt, would be a massive undertaking that would also be prohibitively expensive. The real best environmental option is to basically build a much larger network of pipes that puts the brine back in the ocean, but over a large enough area that it does not do environmental harm.


As a bonus, besides the obvious fact that the amount of salt in all of the nuclear reactors in the world is miniscule compared to the potential output of a desalination plant. There is also the problem that salt used as reactor coolent is not the same salt we find in the ocean."
AskScience,"If UV radiation is used to disinfect and sterilise things then why isn't everything the sun touches (your skin, the sidewalk etc) sterile?","It's about intensity and time.  UV radiation used for disinfection is very high intensity and short duration.  Thus makes it useful for disinfecting at scale.  UV from sunlight is, however, low(er) intensity, long duration, so, while it *can* disinfect, its not good for doing so *at scale*.  You'd probably be surprised at just how ""clean"" a sidewalk is, in all honesty: if not exposed to the sun's rays, it'd be a lot less ""clean"", which is not to say that its clean at all, just that it would be a lot worse without the sun"
AskScience,How does the body know when to purge food through vomiting and/or diarrhea?,"I can answer the diarrhea part since I'm close to finishing a PhD on AB5 bacterial toxins from cholera, e coli, etc.

The body doesn't know so much that it is forced to do so. Your intestinal cells become intoxicated by the toxin, which uses retrograde transport to eventually start a cascade reaction that forces the synthesis of molecules of cAMP. These molecules start the process of pumping out chloride ions from the cell and into the intestine. The body detects that the intestine is not isotonic, which is to say it is too salty, and it solves this by flushing it with water. 

Diarrhea is just an intestine full of water and feces. Since we have little control over liquid release, it comes out rather forcefully and without warning."
AskScience,Have there been attempts to make protons or neutrons using quarks other than up and down?,"Configurations of other quarks are seen in places like particle colliders, but they aren't protons and neutrons. They are different particles. There's a [table of them here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_baryons). For example, two up and a strange quark make a Σ^+ baryon.  

It's worth noting that quarks are not seen by themselves, they are only ever seen in configurations with other quarks or anti-quarks. In fact, the consensus is that quarks *can't* be isolated as individual particles, which is called confinement."
AskScience,Why does it make sense that our eyes are logarithmic light detectors?,"It makes sense to me in a practical manner: from an evolutionary standpoint we need to be able to see bushes rustling with a lurking predator at night, and also be able to see birds of prey swooping down on our hominid ancestor selves against the backdrop of a sunlit sky. Those are huge orders of magnitudes different in terms of the number of photons entering our pupils, and if our detectors were more linear than logarithmic, then one of those two situations would be saturated and we would have to cope with either total day blindness or total night blindness.

From a detector standpoint I'm just impressed that slap dash chemical reactions developed over millions of years of trial and error evolution can do the job so well!"

AskScience,Why don't we have Neandertal mitochondrial DNA?,"Mitochondria pass down 'intact' from mother to child in the egg - there is no 'mixing' of DNA as there is with sperm-egg fertilisation, where the resulting nuclear DNA in the child is a mixture of paternal and maternal DNA.

For there to be no mitochondrial Neandarthal DNA in current humans, this means that there are no current offspring descended from a female Neandarthal ancestor. That is, there is no unbroken line of daughters.

This potentially implies (but doesn't guarantee) one or more of the following:

* Male Sapiens-Female Neanderthal reproduction did not produce female offspring, or produced sterile females.

* Male sapiens were unable to reproduce successfully with female Neandarthals

* There were Sapiens with Neandarthal mitochondria at one point, but none remain in our population (or have ever been discovered)."
AskScience,Can you jump higher on the side of the moon that faces earth because of earths gravity (that pulls you away from the moon) compared to the side that faces away from earth (because here earths gravity pulls you back to the moon) ?,"No. You jump highest when the earth is directly overhead *and* when it's directly under your feet. You jump lowest when the earth RISES and SETS on the horizon.

The constant acceleration of the moon towards the earth cancels out the gravitational pull of the earth on your body. However when you're farthest from the earth, the gravitational pull is *weaker* (so you jump higher) and when you're closest to the earth the gravitational pull is *stronger* (so you also jump higher). This is also how the tides work: high tides are directly underneath the other body AND directly opposite the other body.

AskScience,What are the names of the forces holding wet clay so that it can me molded and holds shape?,"Capillary forces. The strong interfacial attraction between the water and the clay, the water surface tension and the small distances between the clay particles all lead to capillary forces which push/ pull the particles together.

Essentially, the water wets the clay surfaces due to favorable clay-water interactions. When the particles are close enough, water forms curved water-air interfaces bridging between the particles. These are always curved concave into the water phase because of the favorable clay-water interactions. These curved interfaces lead to a lower pressure inside the bridges between the particles and so the particles are pushed together.

You need the water-air interface. Note that when you saturate the clay with water (no more air) it loses its strength.

AskScience,What were conditions like during the Deccan Traps eruptions?,"Broadly, the ~300 kyr before the K-Pg extinction correspond to the Late Maastrichtian Warming Event, which is usually attributed to CO2 degassed from the Deccan Traps (e.g., [Barnet et al., 2018](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/46/2/147/525172/A-new-high-resolution-chronology-for-the-late), [Hull et al., 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay5055), [Nava et al., 2021](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2007797118)). This event reflects a period of short term increase of average temperatures by 2-5^(o) C. The outgassing of CO2 and subsequent uptake of it by the ocean may have also lead to significant ocean acidification (e.g., [Dameron et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018217307009), [Keller et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818120302034)), but distinguishing acidification attributable to the Deccan traps broadly is a bit tricky given expected acidification from the Chicxulub impact (e.g., [Henehan et al., 2019](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1905989116)). While the Late Maastrichtian Warming Event is relatively well tied to the pre K-Pg Deccan Traps both temporally and mechanistically, as discussed in several of the linked papers, it seems like it requires more CO2 to outgas than we'd expect based on eruptive volumes from that time. Finally, relating climate changes to large igneous provinces (like the Deccan Traps) comes with challenges because these eruptions have two main climate modifying components, CO2 which drives warming and SO2 which drives cooling, and while there are often ways to reconstruct the amount of CO2 outgassed, it's much harder to constrain the amount of SO2 (e.g., [Tobin et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216301778)). The Tobin paper is also quite relevant for the ""extreme events"" aspect of the question. I.e., in their modeling of climatic responses, individual pulses don't have too much of an effect, it's more the building of CO2 concentrations in aggregate that has the main climatic impact."
AskScience,Are there any K-Strategists insects?,"Pepsis wasps (tarantula hawk) will fight a single tarantula, paralyze it, drag it back into the spider's burrow, and lay a single egg it. Then when the egg hatches the baby wasp eats the tarantula alive, going for the least vital organs first.

AskScience,How do galaxies move?,"Galaxies exist in the first place because the early universe was not completely uniform. Some regions were slightly denser than others. These density variations were initially at the level of one part in 10-100 thousand (10^(-5) to 10^(-4)), but gravity amplified them over time. Denser regions tended to pull in surrounding matter, becoming still denser. Eventually, the densest patches formed galaxies.

However, initial variations in the density of the universe also existed at scales much larger than galaxies. Due to this large-scale structure, galaxies are now moving toward regions of higher density and away from regions of lower density.

[Here's an example movie.](https://youtu.be/JAyrpJCC_dw?t=20) ""z"" in the corner is the redshift, essentially inverse time (smaller is later). The key point is that galaxies form (the yellowish color) but continue moving as they coalesce into still larger systems."
AskScience,Is it possible for meteor impacts to create volcanic hotpots at antipodes?,"Plagiarizing a bit from previous answers I wrote - there's generally a consensus (and demonstrable evidence) that impacts cause melting and that sufficiently large impacts can produce similar volumes of melt to Large Igneous Provinces (e.g., [Elkins-Tanton & Hager, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05005844)) and further suggestions that they might be able to initiate some amount of prolonged melting after the impact that would look similar to a plume (e.g., [Jones et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X02008245), [Jones, 2005](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article/1/5/277/137590/Meteorite-Impacts-as-Triggers-to-Large-Igneous)). Critically though, these are arguing for melting / LIP formation *colocated* with the crater (and basically obliterating/filling the crater), *not* antipodal or even significantly displaced from the impact site. By the time you're at an impact with sufficient kinetic energy to induce melting on the other side of the planet, you're basically at the scale of the moon forming impact where the entire crust and large portions of the mantle of the Earth were melted (i.e., to induce melting on the other side of the planet from the impact, you'd basically need to induce melting everywhere between the impact and the antipode). Following that, it's also worth noting that the ability to generate large volumes of melt depends a lot on the details of both the impactor (mainly its kinetic energy, so a mixture of its size, density, and velocity), but also the target (e.g., lithosphere thickness, mantle temperature, etc) and generating large volumes of melt is not common (e.g., [Ivanov & Melosh, 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/31/10/869/29143/Impacts-do-not-initiate-volcanic-eruptions)). For example, the Elkins-Tanton & Hager paper highlights that large volume of impact melting was likely more common earlier in Earth history both when impacts (some very large) were more common, but also the Earth was generally hotter and the vast majority of LIPs that are preserved today are not explainable with impacts.

I'm going to guess this question is inspired by the oft (misunderstood) hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact influenced the Deccan Traps eruption? With reference to this, the beginning of the Deccan Traps eruption cleary predates the impact by ~250,000 years (e.g., [Schoene et al., 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaa0118)) so the impact was not the cause of the Deccan Traps (or the plume that generated the Deccan Traps). There has been the suggestion that the impact may have led to a temporary increase in its eruptive activity (e.g., [Renne et al., 2013](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1230492)), but the evidence for this remains a bit enigmatic and depends on the precise timing of the particular eruptive phase relative to the impact. In terms of these details, there are some challenges related to mixing of different type of geochronometers (e.g., [Schoene et al., 2021](https://gchron.copernicus.org/articles/3/181/2021/)) that make conclusively rejecting or accepting the hypothesis of a trigger of an eruptive pulse in the Deccan Traps by the impact pretty hard."
AskScience,What happens to a molecule when one of the atoms radioactively decays?,"I'll answer this for minerals specifically. The atoms that make up an individual mineral grain are arranged in an [ordered lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure) where a specific ""site"" within the lattice accommodates a particular type of atom, where the easiest (but overly simplified) way to think about it is that the ""correct"" atom for that site will be a function of both ionic radius and charge. If we consider a site occupied by an unstable atom, for example a ^(40)K atom within a potassium bearing mineral or ^(238)U within either a uranium bearing mineral or a mineral for which uranium can ""substitute"" for one of the normal components of the lattice (e.g., uranium substituting for zirconium in a zircon crystal), when a decay happens we can consider two different effects: **(1)** there may be some amount of ""recoil"" (depending on the type of decay) that can damage the crystal lattice and **(2)** typically the radioactive product is not the right fit for the lattice (either in terms of charge, ionic radii, or both).

**For the recoil effect**, the general idea is that in decay types where the result is the ejection of a particle with some mass, then some of the energy of the decay is converted to kinetic energy that can damage the lattice. During an [alpha decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay) (e.g., which occurs multiple times during the decay of a single atom of ^(238)U to ^(206)Pb), an alpha particle (He nucleus) is ejected from the atom. This imparts a small amount of recoil (just like the kick in firing a gun), but because the mass differential between the emitting atom and the alpha particle is usually quite large (think a big heavy cannon shooting a tiny little BB), there is only a small amount of movement of the emitting atom, whereas the alpha particle is shot out pretty fast (and sometimes may actually be shot out of the crystal). The alpha particle is light and small enough that it typically does not damage the lattice, but the small shift of the decaying atom can distort the lattice a bit around the site where it sits. 

This recoil effect, and the damage it causes the lattice, can be much more extreme in [spontaneous fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_fission). As the name implies, this is a decay mode where an atom suddenly splits into two usually somewhat equal (but not necessarily exactly equal) massed atoms. In this case, both products have a good amount of kinetic energy and have enough mass/size that they can significantly damage the lattice, leaving behind what you can kind of think of as little bullet tracks, i.e., [fission tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_track_dating#/media/File:%C3%87jkgfmj.jpg). For natural materials, isotopes that occur in any real abundance and are heavy enough to undergo spontaneous fission are ^(232)Th, ^(235)U, and ^(238)U, where the vast majority of fission tracks are created by ^(238)U. Spontaneous fission events are rare compared to ""normal"" decay of these isotopes, but they do happen (and we can use them to [date a mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_track_dating)).

Collectively, the small recoil effect from alpha decays and the much larger recoil effect and resulting fission tracks from spontaneous fission are referred to as ""radiation damage"" within crystals and in terms of the lattice, they represent ""defects"". Defects in crystal lattices can actually move around and/or be closed and effectively ""heal"" themselves over time, but it's a temperature dependent process. At high temperatures, individual portions of the lattice can easily move (through the propagation of [dislocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation), etc.) and this radiation damage is quickly (in a geological sense) healed. At lower temperatures, the processes allowing crystals to heal are less efficient so radiation damage is effectively permanent (unless the crystal is heated up again).

EDIT: It's worth explicitly stating that other decay modes (e.g., beta decay, electron capture) would not be expected to cause any damage to the lattice.

**With respect to the decay product itself**, as described above, these are often atoms that are not ""happy"" in the lattice, i.e., they have the wrong charge or size for the spot they're in within the lattice. Through somewhat similar processes as the healing of the radiation damage, these ""impurities"" tend to diffuse out of the crystal, but again this is a temperature dependent process. At high temperatures, this diffusion is relatively efficient and these products can often move out of the crystal easily. At lower temperatures, these products, even though they're unhappy, can't effectively move out of the crystal and get stuck because there is insufficient energy to allow them to move (or to allow the lattice to deform enough for them to move). This rate of diffusion is mostly temperature dependent, but will also strongly depend on the type of atom in question (e.g., what is the radioactive product), the type of lattice (e.g., what mineral is it in), and other details (e.g., grain size of the crystal, the rate of temperature change of the crystal, etc.). For a given type of crystal and type of radioactive product, we can consider that there is a [closure temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_temperature) for the system, where above the closure temperature diffusion is efficient enough that the radioactive products easily leave the crystal and below the closure temperature, diffusion out of the crystal is very inefficient to the point where we can consider it a ""closed"" system. The radiation damage from above can also play a role here as lots of radiation damage can make a crystal ""leaky"" and allow certain radioactive products to diffuse out more easily (which effectively changes the closure temperature). 

As an aside, we actually use this idea of a closure temperature to great effect in radiometric dating. Specifically, for a system (i.e., a mineral and particular radioactive parent and child isotope pair), if the closure temperature is near or above the crystallization temperature we can use that as a [geochronometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronometry), i.e., the time when the system becomes closed reflects when the mineral formed. If instead, the system has a closure temperature well below the crystallization temperature, then we can use it as a [thermochronometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochronology), where the time since the system became closed reflects when the crystal cooled to a specific temperature range.

**TL;DR** Considering a crystalline solid with an ordered crystal lattice (i.e., a mineral), some decays do damage the lattice. Specifically, alpha decays can impart small amounts of damage and spontaneous fission will leave clear tracks behind tracing the path of the two decay products. This damage can heal at high temperatures. The decay product usually is not the right size or charge to be stable in the lattice so will tend to diffuse out, but this is also temperature dependent. At high temperatures, broadly these decay products will easily diffuse out, but at low temperatures, there is insufficient energy for them to diffuse out of the lattice and they remain stuck."
AskScience,Why is urine yellow?,"Breakdown of red blood cells results in bilirubin which gets stored in your gallbladder. It then gets excreted into your intestines and converted a couple times to end up in two “exit” forms: stercobilin (which gives your stool it’s brown color) and urobilinogen which ends up in your bladder and peed out. This urobilinogen oxidizes with air once you pee and converts to urobilin which has a yellow color! People with ~~gallbladder~~ biliary blockages or liver disease which prevents the ~~breakdown~~ excretion of bilirubin may actually have near-pigmentless stool (acholic stool)

The other pigments in your food like from a strawberry or steak are more likely to be broken down in your intestines and excreted as poop (which is already pretty brown so color changes are less perceptible) or end up as colorless contributors to your urine. Beets are a strong example of a pigment that some folks can’t breakdown as well so it gets excreted in both stool and urine and giving a pink or red hue."
AskScience,Does galvanic corrosion take place when aluminum bronze is in contact with steel?,"Short answer: Yes.Long answer: Galvanic corrosion takes place when any two metals come in contact with each other.

How aggressive the reaction is depends on how different their electrochemistry is, with the more anodic metal losing material or corroding.Steel is also a very broad category.

AskScience,Why does it take so long for the sun to exhaust its fuel?,"Nuclear fusion is actually not all that fast, because fusing 2 nuclei requires a very specific set of extreme conditions. And while the temperature in the core of the Sun is very high, the density isn't that great. The average density of the Sun is about a quarter of that the Earth and only in the core is the density greater than that of Earth. Note that fusion only takes place in the core of the Sun, not in the surface layers. And even at the densities and temperature in the core, the chance of 2 nuclei fusing is still very low. Most interactions don't result in a fusion event.

The fusion that does take place in the core of the Sun produces a lot of radiation and this exerts an outward pressure on the Sun, forcing it to expand outwards. On the other hand, there's the gravity working to collapse the Sun inward. If the rate of fusion in the core goes up, so does the radiation pressure, which causes the Sun to expand, lowering the density and thereby the rate of fusion. So the Sun is in an equilibrium where the radiation pressure from the fusion reaction counteracts the force of gravity. 

All things combined, this results in the power density of the core of the Sun being about [276 W/m^(3)](https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/04/17/3478276.htm), which is, supposedly, less than that of a compost heap. And considerably less than the power density of an average human (~100 W / ~0.065 m^(3)).

The Sun is a pretty inefficient power plant in terms of performance for its size. But the saving grace is that it so enormously big that even at this low power density,  the total power production is still as massive as it is."

AskScience,When will vulcanism and tectonic movement on earth end?,"A lot depends on the exact rate of cooling, but it's less about the crust thickening and more about the mantle becoming too cool for tectonics to continue.

That basically overlaps with [estimations of when all but single cellular life on Earth will die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)."
AskScience,"Plate tectonics and earthquakes, which movement is most devastating?","> As a layman, I understand that earthquakes happen because of plate movement in the crust.

More of a terminology thing, but plates are blocks of [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) that are moving, where the lithosphere includes both the crust and a portion of the upper mantle. You are correct that earthquakes reflect plate movement, in short, as a whole plates move steadily (consider this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/) entry discussing drivers of plate motion), but largely because of friction, their edges (i.e., plate boundaries) typically display more ""stick-slip"" behavior. Meaning that they do (elastically) accumulate strain near the boundary but the boundary itself doesn't slip until the frictional strength of the fault is overcome, producing an earthquake when this threshold is reached (e.g., the [seismic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_cycle)).

> It is either plates are moving apart, or colliding, or moving under the other one (subduction).

There are three types of boundaries, but you're missing one of them. [Divergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_boundary) boundaries are where plates are moving apart, forming normal faults. [Convergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary) boundaries are where plates are colliding, forming reverse or thrust faults, but this effectively is the same as one plate moving under another. Subduction zones are one type of convergent boundary, whereas collisional boundaries between two continental portions of plates are not subduction zones, but still convergent. The one that you were missing was [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_fault) boundaries, where two plates are moving past each other and forming a strike-slip fault (e.g., the San Andreas).

> Which movement is most devastating for our cities?

There are going to be a lot of factors that play into whether a particular earthquake is damaging. The two most directly related to plate tectonics are the size (i.e., the magnitude) and the depth of the earthquake. Broadly, larger earthquakes that are shallow will have more intense shaking at the surface because earthquake waves attenuate with distance, so waves from shallow earthquakes will attenuate less before reaching the surface. Obviously then also the proximity of a given city to the epicenter of an earthquake is important. It is however worth mentioning that there are other geologic and non-geologic considerations for what makes an earthquake more damaging. For example the nature of the crust in the location of a particular city can either serve to additionally amplify or attenuate seismic waves depending on the details (i.e., [seismic site effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects)). In terms of damage that occurs, a huge consideration has nothing to do with geology, but is instead the type of construction and whether buildings were engineered with earthquakes in mind. This is generally why, even for largely identical earthquakes in terms of magnitude, depth, and distance to a particular city, countries with strict earthquake-minded building codes tend to have less loss of life than countries with non-existent or poorly enforced earthquake-minded building codes.

Ultimately though, your question really is **Which type of plate boundary produces the largest magnitude earthquakes?** A logical place to start is by asking what controls earthquake magnitude? Physically, we know that the size of an earthquake scales with the size of the area/length of a fault that ruptures during an earthquake (e.g., [Wells & Coppersmith, 1994](http://activetectonics.asu.edu/ActiveFaultingSeminar/Papers/Wells_and_Coppersmith_1994.pdf) - note, the magnitude scaling relationships here are a bit out of date, e.g., [Stirling et al., 2013](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/103/6/2993/331667/Selection-of-Earthquake-Scaling-Relationships-for), but they get the point across). Thus, plate boundaries that allow for larger continuous areas of a fault to rupture at once, can produce larger earthquakes. 

From the above, we can consider both along-strike (i.e., along the fault in a horizontal direction) continuity and the dip of the fault (i.e., the angle that the fault plane makes horizontal). The along-strike continuity is important because if individual fault segments tend to be short and mostly unlinked, then earthquake sizes are limited by the longest possible segment. The dip of the fault is important because stick-slip behavior (that produces earthquakes) is actually temperature dependent and when the temperature is too high, frictional processes no-longer dominate and faults tend to instead ""creep"", i.e., accumulate slow, continuous movement without earthquakes. This means that faults that have a shallow dip (i.e., make a small angle with respect to horizontal) tend to be able to support larger earthquakes because for the same fault along-strike length, there can be a greater area that is in the ""sweet-spot"" temperature wise for stick-slip behavior.

Finally, if we consider some general characteristics of the three types of faults, we can relate these back to earthquake size. From simple expectations (e.g., [Andersonian fault mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson%27s_Theory_of_Faulting)), we expect strike-slip (transform) faults to have nearly a vertical dip, normal (divergent) faults to have a high angle dip of ~60 degrees, and thrust (convergent) faults to have a low angle dip of <30 degrees. Additionally, what we observe is that normal faults tend to be very segmented, strike-slip faults can be pretty variable in terms of segmentation, and thrusts (especially subduction zones) tend to be able to support very long, continuous segments. If we put all of that together, generally, we expect that normal faults have kind of the lowest maximum possible earthquake sizes (short segments, high angle), strike-slip faults are kind of in the middle (longish segments, high angle), and thrust faults have the largest possible maximum magnitudes (long segments, shallow angle, greatest possible rupture areas).  This is why so-called ""great earthquakes"", i.e., those with magnitudes >9, exclusively happen on thrusts, and specifically subduction zones. That is not to say that either normal faults or strike-slip faults are not capable of producing damaging earthquakes, but we would not expect either of these types to support a M>=9 event.

**In short,** we expect convergent (thrust) boundaries to be able to support the largest magnitude earthquakes, with transform (strike-slip) second, and divergent (normal) to support the smallest maximum magnitudes. These are very general expectations and there are exceptions and all types can definitely produce earthquakes that are damaging (especially given local geologic and non-geologic consideration discussed in the longer answer above), but it is demonstrably true that the largest observed earthquakes have occurred on thrusts and this generally fits with our expectations of the physics and physical limitations of earthquake/fault behavior."

* BF.7 is highly immune evasive, people vaccinated in China (even with 3 doses) are very unlikely to be protected from infection. Vaccination coverage is extremely low in the most vulnerable age groups. ~40% of elderly above age 80 have a 3rd dose, ~70% have 2 doses. This likely increases the amount of deaths reported as BF.7 does not show any noticeable changes in clinical severity compared to other Omicron subvariants. At the current time, it's more likely we're seeing a founder effect where the initial strain to first hit the population will dominate the landscape regardless of how fit the virus is. For example, XBB is way more fit to sweep China but that isn't happening (yet). This leads into my next point:

* We're seeing unprecedented infections in a population that is largely infection naïve. Compared to the rest of world where there is stronger hybrid immunity built up from vaccination + infection induced immunity, China is facing the 1st wave in a population with solely boosted immunity. As seen in the rest of the world, current variants were capable of causing waves every couple months in spite of infection-induced immunity.

* 3 doses (Coronavac) + BF.7 infection also does not provide strong protection from infection against the variants that are currently the most dominant around the world (XBB and BQ.1.1).

---

On the other hand there are some upsides:

* BF.7 has circulated widely around the world and was detected in many different countries prior to China's current predicament. BF.7 was de-escalated from monitoring in the UK for low growth rates. BF.7 still makes up a sizeable proportion of sequences at the moment (<10% depending on the country) but BQ.1.1, BQ.1.1.10, XBB.1 and XBB.1.5 are now currently the variants to watch.

* China's approval of an inhaled vaccine may help to curb infections. Something the rest of the world should adopt. Though it's unknown how widespread its deployment is and whether it was given to enough people to curb infections (unlikely considering the numbers we're seeing)

That said, there is definitely cause for concern. Globally, sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 has dropped 90% and widespread infections in such a large population (in a short time) *could* be cause for worry due to the possible emergence of a new variant. Certain countries are in response testing for novel mutations that might pop up from inbound travelers.

AskScience,How much influence does a natural satellite (like the Moon) have on the formation of continents ?,"The kind of cataclysm you're talking about depends *greatly* on how much material you're ejecting into space, and also quite a bit on how far away it ends up. You say that it is a city that's getting yeeted out the planetary airlock, though you call it Mars-like based on its climate. That's a huge range. You're going to have to decide where in that size range it falls in order to get any workable details.

If the amount of crust getting cosmically defenestrated is the size of a city, there will be *little to no impact* on the planet at large. It doesn't matter how far away it ends up in this scenario. It's a small asteroid, too small to fall into a spherical shape, and it's going to need all kinds of magic to have anything to make it habitable, like air or sufficient gravity. 

If on the other hand it's the size of Mars, the entire biosphere of the original planet will be utterly destroyed, the surface liquified, and no kind of life will be able to exist there for several million years (which is what [actually happened](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)) to earth).

You'll need to provide more details."
AskScience,"If the Earth exists long enough, could all of the crust be recycled?","A lot of the major points here are covered in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/crust_recycling/), but the highlights are that the behavior of the two types of crust and lithosphere, i.e., oceanic vs continental, are fundamentally different. Mean residence time for oceanic lithosphere is (geologically) short, somewhere around 200-300 million years. In contrast, continental lithosphere has significantly longer residence times and we don't think about it recycling completely in the same way. As discussed in the FAQ, there are mechanisms by which both new continental crust/lithosphere is generated and portions of continental crust are recycled back into the mantle, but in the context of the question, the important aspect is *where* this happening. 

Specifically, both new continental crust formation and continental crust removal preferentially happen along and near the edges of tectonic plates. The large [cratonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton) interiors of continental portions of plates are broadly considered to have reached a thickness/temperature/composition that is relatively stable in the sense that there are not processes we would expect to significantly alter them at this point. While the basement of these cratonic sections predate much of the history of life, sediments deposited ontop of them (inlcuding those that would record at least some history of multicellular life on Earth) are also more likely to remain ""unrecycled"". 

To fully answer the question though requires a fair bit of speculation, i.e., effectively, is there a possibility that all extant cratons could be completely recycled back into the mantle? With some big caveats, there's not really a compelling reason to think that at this point, assuming tectonics continues to work broadly in the same way, that all cratons could be destroyed. Now, there are mechanisms where cratonic sections of lithosphere can be converted to something more like normal continental crust (e.g., [Liu et al., 2018a](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JB015372)), but even in the cases where this has appeared to happen, (1) it's limited to small sections of cratonic lithopshere and (2) it's not as though the remaining portions of continental lithopshere that use to be the craton are completely recycled, and in fact most of the changes reflect things happening to the mantle portion of the craton, not the crustal portion (e.g., [Liu et al., 2018b](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JB015374))."

AskScience,How do hair/fur covered animals make vitamin D?,"In the case of birds, they have an oil gland near the base of their tail that has vitamin D precursor in it. The birds use their preening oil to clean their feathers, and in the process the oil gets exposed to UV. The exposed uv gets incidentally consumed by the bird during the preening process. The UV light necessary for this process cannot pass through glass, so pet birds that are never allowed outside end up deficient in calcium because vitamin D is necessary for calcium utilization. A common symptom of calcium deficiency is feather plucking. So if you have an indoor bird that has a plucking problem, one possibility is that it needs direct sunlight. 15 minutes of direct sunlight per day is what vets recommend for birds."
AskScience,What is the ‘widest’ ancestral generation?,"There's too many variables to answer universally. It would vary wildly depending on the individual you started with. 

Edit: See /u/Tidorith's comment below, the rest of what I'm saying here isn't necessarily relevant. 

For what it's worth, the point where unique ancestors would outnumber the population is precisely 30 generations. Whereas if we limited it to just the UK, it would be a number in the low twenties. So the possible variance here isn't dozens of generations, but more like fives. 

So probably around 15-20 generations back? But again, it's impossible to give a universal answer."
AskScience,Is building dams a learned behaviour for beavers?,"Genetically coded.

AskScience,How does a laser mirror control how many times it bounces the laser beam?,"Just adding to the discussion since others have answered. But I attended a talk from someone who worked on LIGO, just after the gravitational waves phenomenon it was built for. I remember they were talking about the insane precision of the instrument, since they needed such an order of magnitude of precision to measure gravitational waves. The mechanism that holds the mirrors and lasers in place has to be able to cancel out the vibrational energy from the crashing of the waves of the ocean on the Pacific shores, 500 km to the west. That vibrational noise, the waves from that were on the order of 10^-12 to 10^-15, and they needed upwards of 10^-22 of precision.

The precision of that instrument is **insane**. Absolutely mind-blowing piece of technology."
AskScience,How and where is oxytocin stored in the hypothalamus?,"Generally, neurons store neurotransmitters until it's time to fire.

It has to have one ""in the chamber."""
AskScience,I have been watching YouTube videos about The Demon Core. Could anyone help out with some questions I have?,">Q1: Why wouldn't this container also cause criticality? Surly the point of the container is to prevent radiation from ""leaking out"" so why wasn't it also causing nutrons to reflect back into the core.

Criticality is extremely sensitive to both the material and the geometry. Lead is a good shield (particularly for photons rather than neutrons), but it's not a very good moderator. And the geometry is not necessarily the same between shielding and a reflector.

>Q2 If a container is necessary to prevent exposure how were the scientists able to move the core from the container to the experiment's equipment, i.e. the hemupheres. 

Things like that can be controlled remotely. Or in the case of a critical assembly, the dose rate might not be very high when the system is not near criticality. So each part can be held individually without shielding, and only when they're precisely assembled in a near-critical state does the dose rate become appreciable.

>Q3 Is the amount of exposure from the core, in the timeframe of preparing and performing the experiment acceptable? (Q3.1) If the core was sitting in a table in a room, could I walk into the room, and sit at the table without serious exposure? Logic tells me this must be the case because scientists and assistants were doing exactly that, and everyone seemed to know that it was safe to be in the room during the experiments.

Yes, if it's not near criticality.

>Q4 As the core reached criticality does the amount of radiation increase steadily , or does it remain at a safe (acceptable) level right up until the point of criticality where it spikes massively?

It all depends on the specifics of the setup in question and what's considered ""acceptable"". As the system approaches criticality from below, the dose rate will increase. [More details here](https://www.nuclear-power.com/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/reactor-dynamics/subcritical-multiplication/).

>Q5. (The last one. Thank you for your patience). If the complete closure of the two hemispheres cause criticality, due to the reflection of the nutrons, why do those same spheres not prevent the radiation from ""getting out"". It seems contradictory to have total reflection and radiation leakage.

It's not *total* reflection, it's just *enough* reflection that on average, each fission neutron induces at least one more fission reaction. There are still plenty of neutrons which don't induce fission, and/or escape the critical assembly entirely."
AskScience,Can you trace a rock back to its quarry of origin?,"Usually, but the degree of specificity depends on the details. Generally, the bulk chemistry of the rock, the mineral makeup of a rock, chemistry of individual minerals within the rock (or of the mineral if the sample is a single mineral), and/or the age of either the rock or sets of minerals within the rock can be used, either alone or in concert to some degree, to reconstruct the ""provenance"" of rocks (and this is true whether we're considering this in a more geologic context or an archaeology one). 

A good example of this from archaeology is using the bulk chemistry of objects crafted out of obsidian to trace their origins to particular volcanoes or volcanic regions (e.g., [Negash & Shackley, 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2006.00239.x), [Mulrooney et al., 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/arco.5069), [Pierce, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416515000859), [Grebennikov & Kuzmin, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618215303153) - see review of the technique in [Glascock, 2020](https://www.sci-cult.com/wp-content/uploads/6.2/6_2_4_Glascock.pdf)) or alternatively using the radiometric age and geochemistry of obsidian together (e.g., [Vogel et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440306000719)). This type of data is incredibly useful for understanding things like ancient trade routes (e.g., [Yacobaccio et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440303001146), [Eerkens et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307001070), [Connolly et al., 2015](http://npshistory.com/publications/usfs/newberry/tgpn-2015.pdf), [Santi et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-022-01527-0)).

The extent to which these provenance methods uniquely reveal the location of sourcing depends on the how ""unique"" the signature (or combination of signatures) within the object/source are, which may vary by technique, but also depends on how well characterized potential sources are, i.e., you need things to match the measurements of the object against. In some cases, based on what's available in the sense of which techniques are appropriate (not all methods are going to be as useful depending on the type of rock/mineral in question), you can still be left with ambiguity. In other cases, you can narrow it down to a very specific site. An example of the latter is something like Stonehenge, where geochemistry, ages, and various mineralogical features have allowed very specific sourcing of the rocks used for different parts of the structure, in some cases down to individual outcrops (e.g., [Bevins et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440320301102), [Bevins et al., 2021a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002959), [Bevins et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21000389))."
AskScience,Do satellites rotate to stay oriented toward earth?,"Yes, to remain oriented to keep a desired side of the satellite pointed towards the surface (the side with cameras or antennas or whatever), it needs to spin once per orbit.

AskScience,Why do some allergies get worse over time and some better? And how does allergen desensitivity work without making the reaction worse?,"Gross oversimplification:
After being exposed to allergen, your body creates memory of it. First exposure is usually mild, you may not even notice it. But your body creates memory as a defense mechanism. Next time you're exposed to allergens, your body gives stronger and quicker response. That's why your allergy reaction can be worse with time.

With desensitization, you're exposed to allergens in such a small dose that you're not reacting to it. Desensitization tricks your body into thinking that the allergen is just a normal thing in environment and you tolerate (desensitized?) the allergens better with time. Of course this is not possible (yet) for every allergens and you should be under close supervision in case something goes wrong and you have severe reaction.

Immunology is really complex but amazing science field.

PS: if you're interested, probably you should search for ""Type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity""."
AskScience,"The two retinas are tied/linked together in the brain. Are they tied 1:1, so that each retinal point corresponds to the same retinal point in the other eye? I.e., each retinal point from one eye shares the same binocular neuron with its counterpoint in the other eye?","Hm... There's not a detailed answer here yet, so I guess I'll jump in.

First thing to realize: in reach retina, there's over 100 million photoreceptors, but only 1 million axons in the optic nerve. How's that work? The answer, is that it's completely accurate to say that the earliest part of visual processing is in the eye. There's 5 layers to the retina. The million ganglion cells sending the optic nerve to central command, a middle 'processing' layer with three main types of interneurons, and the actual photoreceptor cell layer (the other two layers are 'in between' layers made up of the cabling connecting these three cell body layers).

There's actually about 20 different kinds of ganglion cells, so you can look at it as there being 20 different image filters sent in to central. Some with blue/yellow contrast, others for pure luminance contrast, etc. Some of these 'views' have very tiny 'receptive fields' (the part of the retina their signal contains information for). So-called 'P' ganglions for example can have one single cone that causes them to depolarize and fire, though they all have surrounding parts/colors that inhibits firing. Each ganglion cell actually has a fairly complex 'optimal' pattern that makes them fire... Usually either 'light in the center, dark on the edges', the reverse of that, or a color version (blue light but no yellow light, for example). So even by the time the signal's leaving the eye, you're already getting various size views containing different kinds of contrast information. It should be said too, the closer to the fovea (center of the view) the smaller the receptive field gets, so the more detail you can perceive... So the 'resolution' of your view is actually not consistent even just across the eye.

Anyway. So: the optic nerve. These million axons aren't sending pixel information, they're sending 20 pictures, each with larger or smaller receptive fields depending on type and distance from the fovea, and different activation patterns they're 'looking for' to fire. This tract splits off on the way to the central switchboard (the LGN in the thalamus). For the left hemisphere of the LGN (say), you get the right eye's ear half of the view, and the left eye's nose half of the view. Opposite that for the right hemisphere.

So, the left hemisphere switchboard gets input from the right half of the visual field. But these two views don't perfectly line up... Maybe 80% of that view does, but the most peripheral part of the view only gets a signal from the outside edge, not the nose-side edge, so your peripheral vision doesn't have a binocular signal to put together in the first place.

Input from different eyes is totally separate still in this central switchboard. Each hemisphere's LGN has 6 main layers, 3 from each eye, with thin middle layers in between carrying the comparatively small amount of color information (koniocellular layers), also still separated by eye. 

Among other places (pupil and eye muscle autonomic circuits in particular) this tract then gets sent to the primary visual cortex in V1, at the very back of your head. Here, it's still separated by eye. You've got these stripes running from the back to the front, with alternating left eye, right eye input. Perpendicular to that, you've got simple edge detectors going through different orientations, and mixed into all that, you've got these barrel shaped blobs of cells that respond to color information. You can see a picture of what I mean [here](http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tmp3661_thumb1.jpg). One 'cycle' of left eye/right eye, and 180 degrees of orientation preference for edges marks out a roughly 1mm x 1mm 'hypercolumn', that takes in input from a chunk of the retina. These hypercolumn are the basic processing unit here in V1, and they tile over the visual field. The receptive field here is larger than a single cone or rod certainly, but it's still fairly small. You can see that the same parts of the visual field are at least nearby now though, that's what those stripes are... Lined up regions from the same part of the visual field from different eyes.

Once it gets to V2, the next layer of processing, this is where you start to have 'binocular integration', neurons that selectively fire based on visual input from both eyes.

As you climb up in levels, you'll see larger and larger receptive fields. By the time you get deep into the ventral visual stream (very loosely speaking, ventral stream is identifying things you're seeing, dorsal stream is for helping to guide hands and stuff for grabbing things and so on) you're seeing cells that selectively fire given complex input from anywhere in the visual field. A 'Jennifer Aniston' neuron for example that might fire anytime you're seeing her face... Or her name written, or a drawing of her, or so on, from anywhere in the visual field.

But anyway. You get the gist. The full complex view of even the early visual system is hilariously intricate, and there's no really simple description that captures all the detail. But maybe a partway answer that's close enough... Peripheral vision has no binocular component, since only one eye captures that outside edge. For the bulk of your visual field though, yes... Things get tied together eventually, but it's not until V2... After many layers of processing in the retina, LGN, and V1. By then, you're talking about receptive fields with hundreds of input photoreceptors, and you're already talking about integrating signals for fairly high level information... Direction of movement, edge orientations, color information and so on, all in separate parallel feeds, to be integrated into even more high level, abstract tracts of information with even larger receptive fields as you continue climbing up towards the dorsal (hand eye coordination) and ventral (object recognition) tracts.

Note too: every step here is more tightly interconnected than I'm describing. In particular, there's 10x connections coming BACKWARDS from downstream than there are coming in from upstream towards the retina, so you probably do have some binocular signal affecting neuron firing even before you get to the binocular integration part in V2. Those incredibly numerous backpropagating connections aren't well understood, but it does definitely complicate the question of where you can start pointing to neurons influenced by input from both eyes in the same part of the visual field. 

So anyway... There you go, haha. This is largely cobbled together from Kandel's 'principles of Neuroscience, 6th edition', there's a half dozen chapters in the low 20's going through how the brain processes visual information in pretty heavy detail."
AskScience,Do plants prepare for the winter? What do they do? And what if the weather is totally different from the norm?,"They essentially hibernate much like a bear! Actually it would in the case of plants be called dormancy. 
When winter comes, the woody parts of trees and shrubs can survive the cold. The above ground parts of herbaceous plants (leaves, stalks) will die off, but underground parts (roots, bulbs) will remain alive. In the winter, plants rest and live off stored food until spring.
During summer days, leaves make more glucose than the plant needs for energy and growth. The excess is turned into starch and stored until needed. As the daylight gets shorter in the autumn, plants begin to shut down their food production.
Many changes occur in the leaves of deciduous trees before they finally fall from the branch. The leaf has actually been preparing for autumn since it started to grow in the spring. At the base of each leaf is a special layer of cells called the ""abscission"" or separation layer. All summer, small tubes which pass through this layer carry water into the leaf, and food back to the tree. In the fall, the cells of the abscission layer begin to swell and form a cork-like material, reducing and finally cutting off flow between leaf and tree. Glucose and waste products are trapped in the leaf. Without fresh water to renew it, chlorophyll begins to disappear.
What is the process of dormancy?
During the active months of growth (April-August), each plant is using the photosynthetic process to change carbon dioxide, water, and certain inorganic salts into carbohydrates. These are used by the plant or stored for use during the winter.  At the end of the season, plants begin to move these sugars and carbohydrates from the leaves down in the roots to nourish the plant for the winter months.  Plants are no longer growing.  
Each plant is transformed differently in the fall, but ultimately dormancy is the way plants conserve energy by using the stored sugars and carbohydrates they produced during the growing season to survive the winter.
As plants grow, they are affected by temperature and sunlight.  These two forces act as signals to plants that winter is coming.  As the day length shortens, plants begin to slow growth and the dormancy process begins in each plant.  In spring, shorter nights encourage plants to actively grow. However, in autumn, longer periods of darkness (August-October) and typically cooler temperatures are obvious indicators to plants that winter is around the corner.

AskScience,What makes bats a good disease vector?,"It depends on what species of bat you're referring to but as a blanket statement, it seems bats have the ability to limit certain responses to diseases like inflammation. It's not that bats are immune to viruses or anything, they simply have a much higher tolerance for diseases. A lot of the damage caused by illnesses is our body's reaction and how it fights it off. Things like fever which is designed to kill off infections also significantly disrupts the body and in some cases can cause as much if not more damage than the actual infection or virus.

Bats have the ability to control their body's response to diseases much more than other animals. This may also explain their relatively long lifespans. So they can act normally despite carrying a viral load that would make other animals like humans go nuts trying to get rid of it."
AskScience,"What is the difference between atomic, nuclear and hydrogen bombs?","""Atomic bomb"" and ""hydrogen bomb"" are not really modern terminology, but they're both subsets of nuclear weapons.

But generally speaking, ""atomic bomb"" refers to nuclear weapon designs which are either fission-only, or boosted fission.

And then ""hydrogen bomb"" (also known as *thermonuclear*) refers to weapons which derive a significant amount of their yield from fusion reactions, in addition to fission.

>Moreover, is hydrogen bomb more powerful and destructive than a nuclear bomb?

""Hydrogen bombs"" *are* a type of nuclear weapon. And generally higher yields can be achieved with them than with ""atomic bombs"" (fission-only or boosted fission), for a given mass of fuel."
AskScience,"Do rivers flow down the path of pre-existing valleys, or carve valleys out themselves?","Both. In some settings, rivers will definitely carve new paths, especially in cases where no clear valleys exist, e.g., an area resurfaced by volcanic flows or an area of land that emerges from a body of water from uplift, etc. Understanding the details of how large-scale drainage networks are originally established is actually something we don't know that well (at least from natural examples, there are lots of explorations of this in both numerical and physical/analogue models and there is lots of work on small scale feature formation, like [gullies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gully) and [rills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rill)), because there just aren't that many places we can observe the formation of a new large-scale drainage network in a place that previously did not have one, i.e., preexisting river networks are pretty ubiquitous.

In areas with preexisting river networks, there was a long-standing assumption of a tendency toward what we would refer to as *antecedence*, i.e., a river maintaining its course. A classic example would be a low relief/gradient area with rivers that then begin to experience enhanced rates of uplift. If the river, in its current planform configuration, can ""keep up"" with the rate of uplift, then the river will maintain its course even as the rest of the landscape increases relief around it, i.e., the river is antecedent in the sense that it predates the current landscape. Recently though (last 10 years), as a community, fluvial geomorphologists have generally recognized that in these same settings, i.e., an area experiencing uplift, not all streams will be able to maintain their course and that large-scale drainage reorganization of the network is actually not uncommon (and might be expected to some degree). Much of this reorganization happens through processes like [stream capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_capture) or progressive drainage divide motion (which is a more gradual form of the more abrupt capture process), but could also include the diversion and formation of new river paths in some cases. There is also certainly the potential for a sequence of events where 1) a river carves a valley, 2) during drainage reorganization the headwaters  of the river are captured and the valley is effectively abandoned (i.e., it becomes a [wind gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gap)), and 3) continued reorganization leads to another river occupying the previously abandoned valley (i.e., the wind gap becomes a [water gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_gap)). Ultimately, antecedent streams are definitely a thing, but the assumptions of mostly static drainage networks in the face of major landscape changes is not supported by a growing body of literature.

In terms of truly *new* paths being carved, these are going to be more common in either areas like those described in the first paragraph or relatively low relief and/or non-bedrock areas (that are also effectively being resurfaced by active floodplain deposition) where processes like [crevasse splays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crevasse_splay) and [avulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_%28river%29) are quite common and effectively represent the ""carving"" of new river channels."

AskScience,Can ancient writing systems be extrapolated by some measure of complexity?,"Not really, TBH. Writing systems don't necessarily change at any particular pace; especially since they're much more under the conscious control of their users than spoken language is. We can infer from the fact that the Chinese script and the Mayan script both are fully-functional linguistic writing systems from the earliest attestations that both were likely preceded by some kind of proto-writing system like the one we can watch Sumerian grow out of, but there's no way to know for sure how long that process was or even much about what it might have looked like. 

That said, I think we can make some decent, if vague, educated guesses. Here's my understanding of what we know about the three-or-four instances of truly independent inventions of writing:

* In the case of Sumerian, we can actually watch it develop out of a mnemonic system used for trade and taxation. The first attestations of this nonlinguistic system are from about 3300 BC, and the first real linguistic elements start appearing about four hundred years later. After that the forms of the letters slowly become more and more abstract, as medium-dependent ease-of-writing considerations start to become more important than the need to make the characters an obvious picture of anything.
* Egyptian is a fully-formed linguistic writing system by about 2600 BC, though there are a few apparent uses of the system several hundred years before, so it's hard to put a clear date on the transition from mnemonics to real linguistic writing. It's not clear if Egyptian is an independent development or inspired by Sumerian; both develop around the same time. Egyptian gets its own schematic / simplified system (Hieratic) not much later than that 2600 BC date, but the system using very obvious pictures continues in use in formal contexts until the system finally stops being used entirely after the the Christianisation of the Roman Empire.
* Chinese writing is only attested from the 1200s BC on discarded divinatory bones, but appears as a full linguistic system with no apparent predecessor nonlinguistic mnemonic system. However, we can infer from the character 冊 ('book, bound volume') that it was almost certainly written on other materials at the same time and before - the character appears in these oracle bone inscriptions, and is apparently a depiction of the kind of bound-bamboo-strip book known to have been used for centuries in China. So odds are it also had the same development process, but all of it happened on perishable material that's all gone now. The oracle bone script's characters are typically much less abstract than later Chinese script forms, suggesting that it possibly hadn't had all that much time to develop into more abstract and easier to write characters - it may have still been fairly new as a full linguistic system by that 1200s BC date.
* Mayan also appears ex nihiló as a fully functional linguistic system in stone inscriptions, potentially as early as the 300s BC. Again, it's entirely likely that it was used on perishable materials well before that - we still have a few Mayan bark-paper codices from later times. A few undeciphered inscriptions in [one or more possible related systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmian_script) have also been found with dates (written on them!) in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, suggesting that the Mayan system or a predecessor had enough use on perishable materials to spawn other systems besides the surviving Mayan one, which were themselves used almost exclusively on perishable materials. Given that even by the 1500s the Mayan script hadn't been particularly simplified for ease of writing, it's nearly impossible to say how long it had developed beforehand.

(Every other script in the world is likely descended from one of these four, if not by adoption-and-adaptation then at least by contact with a literate culture.)

So given that Sumerian took about half a millennium from first attestations to being a significantly linguistic system rather than just a pictographic mnemonic system, we can infer that these other systems probably also had at least a few centuries of use in such ways before their attestations on more durable media."
AskScience,"If prions are so difficult to destroy and spread easily, why aren't the diseases they cause more widespread?","Prions don't spread that easily. They typically have to be ingested or enter the bloodstream in some way and rarely spread person to person. In comparison to the average virus or bacteria that makes them many orders of magnitude less virulent. It also makes the standard protections that we use against viruses and bacteria, like glove wearing and protecting ourselves from blood and tissue, incredibly effective against prions.

As a side note, prion diseases may be much more common than we know. There are some theories that diseases like Parkinson's might be caused by prions and are actually spread among people."
AskScience,"If the body produces more melanin when exposed to UV rays, would being in a dark environment lighten the color of your iris?","Darkness won't make your brown eyes blue.

Skin is constantly renewing itself. It turns brown in the sun but that skin flakes off and six months later you're cracker-white again. 

The iris and things attached to it have very slow metabolism, and epithelial cells containing melanin don't usually slough off unless there's friction or a pigment dispersion syndrome. And then you can see little melanocytes floating up and down in the anterior chamber convection currents. They don't disappear. Loose melanocytes and any inflammatory cells eventually accumulate here and there and even clog up the drain causing glaucoma.

Eyes are sometimes born lighter and develop more melanin. But it rarely goes the other way.. when you see color change from brown to lighter colors in the human iris, it's usually a pathological process. The idea that iris color changes morning to evening or in any other cyclic fashion would be unsupported by evidence. *Apparent* color is influenced by illumination, background, and subjective naming."
AskScience,How has the construction of hundreds of water reservoirs impacted the Texas climate over the last 60 years?,"This seems to be built on a variety of flawed premises, but we can break this into two bits, (1) Does the construction of reservoirs generally influence local to regional climate? and (2) How has climate in Texas changed over the period in question?

(1) Does the construction of reservoirs generally influence local to regional climate?

Yes, a bit, but not nearly as much as seems to be suggested here and also not necessarily in the direction assumed. There are a variety of studies looking at the effects of particular reservoirs, for example the reservoir created by the massive Three Gorges Dam, where work has suggested that this reservoir has a pretty minimal effect on local climate (e.g., [Wu et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212002972), [Li et al., 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029970)). More general work looking at the influence of reservoir construction specifically on precipitation has been equivocal in the sense of suggesting that it can lead to minor increases or decreases in precipitation depending on the local details (e.g., [Winchester et al., 2017](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/21/9/ei-d-16-0016.1.xml), [Zhao et al., 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac263c/meta)). Specific to Texas, there is work to suggest that the presence of reservoirs may enhance convective thunderstorm formation, but the effect of this basically limited to the reservoir itself (e.g., [Haberlie et al., 2015](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4461)). More generally, this question seems predicated on the common idea that simply impounding water in a location will lead to more precipitation in that location, which in turn assumes that water evaporated locally primarily falls as precipitation locally. In reality, the precipitation recycling ratio (i.e., the ratio of precipitation that comes from local evaporation) can be extremely variable and it is in no way a given that simply making more surface water available for evaporation in an area will dramatically increase local precipitation if the PRR is low, e.g., see this [prior discussion of PRR with respect to this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wp7y7v/how_the_us_weather_be_different_if_the_western/).

(2) How has climate in Texas changed over the period in question?

The analysis from [Gelca et al., 2014](https://twj-ojs-tdl.tdl.org/twj/article/view/7001/6100) spans much of the time period of interest and highlights that there have been some changes in the variability/intensity and seasonality of precipitation, but not much change in terms of average annual totals. The changes observed are related more to (global) climate change and not the (local) construction of reservoirs. More broadly, I'm not sure there's much veracity to the idea that the arid portions of Texas are somehow no longer arid. Looking to the future, if anything, aridity is expected to increase, not decrease (e.g., [Neilsen-Gammon et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EF001552))."
AskScience,Rivers form as freshwater moves from a higher elevation to a lower elevation. How come we don't see rivers that haven't reached the ocean yet?,"For the quick way of interpreting your question, [endorheic basins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin), i.e., internally drained watersheds where rivers flow into lakes instead of the ocean, are definitely a thing.

Another way to interpret your question is ""Why don't we see 'in progress' rivers where a river forms and starts flowing toward the ocean but hasn't reached it yet?"" The short version is that (1) it requires a *very low* slope for water to start flowing, (2) once water starts to flow on an erodible substrate (i.e., soil, regolith, rock), it starts to channelize pretty quickly, (3) the timescale for growing topography is *much longer* than the timescale for a channel to begin to form, and (4) even in the event of a ""new"" river forming somewhere on growing topography, it's not as though this river will chart a new course to the ocean, it will flow downhill always effectively toward the lowest local point (and so on until it reaches *baselevel* whether that's the ocean or an internally drained lake) and almost always, flowing toward the local lowest point means this ""new"" river will connect to an existing river system *long* before it reaches the ocean. Thus, when we think about new topography forming, we pretty much always think about it forcing a *drainage reorganization*, i.e., it reorders existing river networks to reflect the new way water flows, but mostly in the area with new topography (though there can be downstream effects, depending on the details).

Finally, we do kind of see rivers where the water doesn't always reach the ocean but sometimes does. Specifically an [ephemeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River#Permanence_of_flow:_perennial_and_ephemeral) river is one where the channel exists, but water continuously flowing in it does not, usually because the catchment for this river is in an arid location and only sporadically or seasonally receives enough precipitation for their to be runoff and channelized flow in the river. In an ephemeral river, it's definitely possible for the channel to be dry and for there then to be a large storm event that generates a flood pulse where you can see the ""front"" of the river moving down the system and eventually reaching the ocean (maybe, depending on whether there's enough water to make it to the ocean before it evaporates and/or infiltrates) over the course of hours/days/weeks depending on the size of the system."

AskScience,How is the human gut microbiome established in infancy or earlier on?,"Put simply, babies are most often born in blood and shit. It's messy. And that shit (or thin liquid, or mucus) contains gut bacteria which the baby needs to survive. All it takes is brief contact. Even a birth in water is not free from this issue, the bacteria get into the water. Gut bacteria are crawling all over the anal/genital region all the time, as well.

Babies born under overly-sterile conditions often suffer digestive problems; that messy birth is actually helpful.

They also get some gut bacteria from the mother's mouth, breasts, and any other part of the body they suck or lick.

Fecal bacteria - gut bacteria - get all over everything in such situations, and some of it gets into the babies mouth. Welcome to biological life; it's disgusting, but it works."
AskScience,Why do T cells need to bind self-antigen moderately?,"T cells *have* to bind to MHC plus peptide for their function; if they don’t bind at all, they’re never going to be useful. So this is screening for the basic ability to bind MHC. 

Why don’t they get screened against MHC with no peptide, instead of MHC with self peptide? Because there’s effectively no such thing as empty MHC on the cell surface. MHC (either class I or II) needs peptide to reach the surface and remain stable. 

By requiring *moderate* affinity to MHC plus self peptide and screening out high affinity binding, the thymus ensures that self peptide won’t be recognized with enough affinity to actually trigger a mature T cell (which has a different signaling threshold than the developing T cell), but also ensures that the receptor has a chance to bind to MHC plus something non-self. 

Of course it’s a very low chance - the vast majority of T cells produced never find a target, and most may well not have any possible target in the entire universe of possible peptides - but that’s fine, there are plenty of other T cells in the immune repertoire ocean. 

T cell development is a reminder of how weird evolution’s solutions can be, to our human eyes. But it’s worked pretty well for 400 million years so far.

AskScience,"In Parkinson disease, why doesn't the adrenal gland fill the dopamine deficiency?","Unfortunately, dopamine isn’t able to cross the blood brain barrier. The way PD is treated involves use of levodopa (dopamine precursor) in combination with carbidopa (decarboxylase inhibitor;prevents metabolism of levodopa to help it cross the BBB). The nigrostriatal pathway is the dopamine pathway affected in pd, and through this pathway you get your basal ganglia dopamine responsive pathways that modulate motor activity. But in PD these pathways get disrupted so the dopamine system that applies the brakes beats out the pathway applying the gas. I’m very adhd and I suck at explaining things but would be happy to elaborate further! I do have to say there are some very cool therapies in the works for pd, I’m particularly excited about gene therapy"
AskScience,from where do the new nucleotides come in DNA replication?,"Here is a good overview of [nucleotide synthesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nucleotides-synthesis) from Science Direct.

There are two major metabolic pathways to creating the free pool of dNTPs used for synthesizing new strands of DNA by DNA polymerase: recycling old nucleotides and ""de novo synthesis."" De novo synthesis starts with dietary glucose, folate compounds (a.k.a. Vitamin ~~B12~~ B9), and amino acids. The glucose is converted into ribose via the Pentose phosphate pathway, which is the ""ribo"" part of ribonucleic acids (RNA). Folate is used as a co-factor to convert amino acids, primarily glutamate, into nitrogenous bases and phosphates are then added to the molecules. 

Since cells have far more RNA synthesis ongoing at any given time, nucleic acid synthesis is focused on creating RNAs. Ribonucleotide Reductase is the enzyme responsible for converting RNA into DNA by removing an oxygen from the ribose ring. Thymidylate Synthase also converts dUTP to dTTP since DNA uses thymidine instead of uridine as with RNA.

Since cancer is a disease reliant on high rates of DNA replication, many standard chemotherapies block some step in deoxynucleotide synthesis. Ribonucleotide Reductase is a big target for example.

Edit: it had been a little while since i revisited nucleotide synthesis, I corrected the answer to state amino acids are the source of nitrogen for nucleotide synthesis. My research focus has been more on what goes wrong with replication after chemotherapy, specifically the Ribonucleotide Reductase inhibitor gemcitabine. Thanks to u/NakoL"

AskScience,How do we know how old viruses are?,"first of all they're the most simple (and yet the most effective) life form, and therefore it's only logical they can represent one of the first steps in the evolution grand scheme (some scientists believe they evolved from a different branch of cells that sort of regressed tho): specifically the RNA ones are the oldest, since oxygen lacked in the old-earth atmosphere and that favoured RNA over DNA.
Still, they cannot be older than cells themselves, since they need to use them to ""reproduce"".
Very often some viral genetical mark can be traced way back in old DNA as well, and that can give you some sort if indication of the pathways the virus took to get the genetical configuration it has today, but apart from that it's really hard to put a pin in time.

AskScience,"When nucleons bind to form a nucleus, does each nucleon ""retain ownership"" over its quarks (is each nucleon a truly unique entity)? Or is it possible for quarks to swap from one nucleon to another? Or does it not make sense to talk so exactly about them?","In short: Yes nucleons can exchange quarks via mesons, but because of confinement the baryons will always have three valence quarks.

But all, e.g., up quarks are indistinguishable. So it makes no sense to say that a particular quarks left the proton and travelled to another (as part of a pion for example). At the same time a new up-quark must have been created and remained in the original proton.

And then there is the issue of energy scale. The quarks are still bound inside the nucleons, meaning the energy required to get one out is larger than the random energy fluctuations in the system (= temperature). That is why you only exchange virtual mesons rather than real particles. Mathematically this makes it convenient to describe the nucleons as their own things that than interact with one another, rather than looking at all the quarks and gluons and whatnot separately.

You can create states of matter where the quarks are no longer bound, i.e. it makes sense to model things on the quark level. It is called ""quark gluon plasma"", and it exists at much higher energies/temperatures. E.g. it is created briefly in particle colliders, when you smash nuclei into each other."
AskScience,How can a chimera have two different blood types?,"Your blood type is a collection of sugars present on proteins on the surface of your blood (and other tissue) cells. These sugars are added post-translationally by enzymes. The presence or absence of specific enzymes determines which sugars and in what configuration are added. If we look at the traditional ABO blood group, the O-type is a shorter sugar serving as a backbone. If an individual has a certain enzyme, a galactose can be added onto that and a B-antigen is created. If an individual has a different enzyme, then an amide derivative of galactose can be added to create the A-antigen. For a given sugar chain, you can make either A or B antigen sugar.

This means that people with the AB genotype already display two different version of antigens on their cells some with A sugars and some with B sugars. Each cell though will likely contain both types. If we look at a chimera with different blood types, then the tissue that creates the blood cells came from two different genetic origins. So they could create two different types of cells that are each of only one type (O,A,B,AB).

Now to the root of your question - what about blood type incompatibility and antibodies. The key realization that is needed here is that antibodies are created at random. There is no specific antibody gene that makes an :""anti-A"" antibody that is only present in people of not A blood group. If there was, it would be very hard to have children from couples of different blood types. What happens is, early in fetal development, when antibody presenting cells are first making antibodies, each of those antibodies is ""tested"" against binding to the persons own cells. If the antibody binds to ""self"", the cell that makes that specific antibody is destroyed and the antibody never enters circulation. 

All people generate the core O antigen, so no healthy individual makes anti-O antibodies. They have all been removed from circulation. People that also generate any combination of A and B antigens will have the corresponding antibodies removed from circulation as well. Technically, it's possible that an O-type person never develops an anti-A antibody and could even receive A-type blood; however, practically that is unlikely because many of our randomly generated antibodies bind to sugars in some capacity.

So a person with chimeric blood type would have presented both types of antigens to their immune system early on and thus would have never developed antibodies against either type. For example, a chimera of O-type and B-type would show up as either O or B type on a genetic test depending on which tissue is selected. In an agglutination test where the blood is checked for agglutination against antibodies, they would show mixed-field agglutination (some cells agglutinating and other not) with anti-B antibodies. And in an antibody test they would have only ant-A antibodies, thus they could receive O or B blood, and could donate to B or AB individuals.

This uses the ABO example, and of course with proper blood/organ matching there are more types to be considered which makes any kind of transfusion/transplant difficult for chimeric people."
AskScience,Does a reverse placebo exist?,"Absolutely. Placebo in Latin means ""I will please"". The medical sense was recorded in writing by 1785, ""a medicine given more to please than to benefit the patient."" Nocebo in Latin means ""I will not please"". This refers to, say, hearing that a drug has a certain side effect and experiencing that side-effect psychosomatically when you take it. There is an element of priming since your mind is expectant, so even if this side effect is indeed due to the drug the subjective experience of it can be enhanced. It can also extend, as you say, to people being mistrustful of medicine in general experiencing far greater adverse effects than people more open to medical treatment. The causality here and the physiological vs psychological effects are obviously very difficult to determine. Anyways, it's called the Nocebo effect:

AskScience,"Since almost all European vineyards graft on to American rootstock which is resistant to phylloxera, if one didn't do this, would there still by phylloxera around to constitute a threat anymore?","Resistant means that American rootstock tolerate phylloxera feeding on them. It does not mean that phylloxera can't or won't feed on them. 

As far as I am aware, grape phylloxera only feed on roots from the Vitis genera of plants (grapes). America has multiple species of native grapes, nearly all of which are resistant to phylloxera damage. Since they evolved together, phylloxera and American grapes coexist without too much trouble. The problem started when American grapes were brought to Europe, with phylloxera still on their roots. Vitis vinifera, the wine grape, is the only grape species native to Europe. It had no resistance to phylloxera. Any wine grape infested with it will slowly die. The solution was to graft wine grapes onto American rootstock. This became standard practice in nearly every wine growing region worldwide.

Now I said nearly. There are some wine growing areas that have very sandy soils. Phylloxera prefers clay soils and does not do well in sand. Some of these areas have very limited populations of phylloxera. Washington state in the United States is one example of this. Many vineyards there have self rooted vines. In the few places there that have a phylloxera infestation, the standard practice is to replace any failing vines with grafted vines. Phylloxera spreads very slowly when it's not being transported by humans, so that is not a large number of grape vines annually. Grape vines do also have a production lifespan (production does start to drop off after a few decades), so any areas with more loamy or clay soils in Washington are considering replacing with grafted vines when they do, just to forestall any problems. Areas with sandy soil probably won't bother."
AskScience,"do we know how chameleons ""see"" Things with two independent eyes? Is it integrated? Side by side?","To understand the way they ""see"" things, you can re-frame what you think eyes ""do.""  

Eyes take what is in the world and translate it into something the brain can understand. Chameleons probably perceive the world just as the world is--their brain makes a map of what is 'out there' based on the light that falls on their eyes.   

By the way, you own eyes do the same thing. You don't see the ""input"" to your eyes. You see the map of the world that your brain makes from the input.  For example, you don't ""see"" your nose, even though it takes up a bunch of visual space in each of your eyes' visual input. (Close one eye and look for your nose to check!)

You also don't see details in the world except for a tiny fraction of your vision (the ""fovea"" in the center of your visual field).  Want to check:  hold your hand out at arms length and look at your fingernail and without moving your eyes, try and describe any detail on one of your other fingernails. You will likely discover that you can't. You cant even see details a few inches from what you are looking at. Whenever you look at something, you are looking with your fovea. Everything else outside of the fovea is ""blurry"" and much less colored. You mind fills in the blanks and you end up perceiving the world as clear an detailed."

AskScience,Does the dead bodies of deep sea creatures float to the surface or does it stay underwater?,"Some does and other stuff doesn’t isn’t really a very satisfying answer so I will try and generalise as so much different stuff lives in the sea.

The seabed is full of creatures who rely on the “detritus” of dead stuff sinking to the bottom for their food supply so generally speaking as stuff decays it will sink to the bottom.   Plankton that thrives at the surface does sink very slowly when it dies so there is a constant shower of microscopic creatures alive and dead throughout the water column.

There is stuff that floats to the surface when it is pulled up by the tides like some seaweeds that are naturally buoyant so they can stand upright from the seabed.  Much of this floats on the surface and even reaches the beaches some of that floating debris may have creatures attached to it.  It then rots on the beaches and gets dragged back into the sea and sinks. 

However when boats discharge “bycatch” some of it may float on the surface but that’s mainly because the cavities inside the creature that are normally squeezed closed by the ocean pressures have filled up with air by being brought to the surface. Again as it decomposes what isn’t picked of the surface by scavengers will sink to the bottom."
AskScience,Quantum Chemistry: Why does the Exchange Interaction/Integral reduce the energy of the molecular orbital?,"So the exchange integral is supposed to represent the way electrons of the same spin interact, namely, they avoid each other (spatially). You can think of it as a way electrons are ""self-enforcing"" the Pauli principle from general chemistry , namely, no two electrons can have the same 4 quantum numbers. The first three quantum numbers describe the spatial distribution of the electron and the fourth one is spin. So if no two electrons can be in the same region of space with the same spin, you can interpret it as electron with the same spin should want to repel and avoid each other, thus minimizing the overall interelectronic repulsion. This is gross simplification and exchange is an entirely quantum mechanical phenomenon that has no classical analogue.

I need to double check, but I think the Szabo-Ostlund book has the plot of (pair) electron density, where it is shown that due to the exchange correlation, an electron will have diminished probability being around another electron of the same spin. Also, exchange, correlation, etc. are simply ways for us to quantify the missing physical description of the system due to the use of (rather extreme) simplification of using just a single Slater determinant as our wave function."
AskScience,We're any dinosaurs frugivores (diet consisting or mainly fruits and seeds)?,"We do not know of any dinosaurs that were strictly or primarily frugivorous…but [analysis of wear patterns and pitting on dinosaur teeth](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098605) has suggested that ankylosaurs ate fruit at least sometimes, and more frequently than, say, their nodosaur cousins. And the hadrosaurs they studied appear to have eaten basically everything, fruit included.

It has been *proposed* that [*Oviraptor* was frugivorous](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320986075_Oviraptorosaur_anatomy_diversity_and_ecology_in_the_Nemegt_Basin), but this has not been without controversy, and we have found at least one *Oviraptor* with a lizard in its stomach."
AskScience,Can you extract a fully concentrated liquid out of an ice cube (like Coca Cola) until there's almost no water left?,"Sure!  You've basically described *[fractional crystallization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_freezing)*  (also called *fractional freezing* or *jacking*) as originally used to make [Applejack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applejack_(drink)) potent.   

Just as you can purify a solid by crystallizing it out of solution leaving any contaminants dissolved in the solvent, you can purify a low melting solid by partially freezing it out of a melt, and leaving the contaminants concentrated in the residual liquid.  As they are excluded from the solid phase the contaminants get more and more concentrated in the remaining liquid phase, [depressing its melting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting-point_depression), so it doesn't all freeze and it can be separated from the crystallizing solid.  By repeating the process you can recrystallize the solid and get it purer and purer, like in [zone refining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_melting) silicon to get the high purity required for semiconductor applications.

Or you can turn this around and work with the unfrozen phase, as you are suggesting, getting the dissolved component (the ""juice"" in your example) more and more concentrated.  The classic example of this is actually very close to your idea. It is the original process to concentrate the alcohol in making Applejack:  partially freezing fermented cider, removing some water as ice, and repeating the process.  The separation isn't 100% so you will never get to pure alcohol: there will always be a little alcohol left with the ice and some water remaining in the liquid phase.  (The theoretical limit is 92% pure alcohol).  But by going back and forth, thawing and refreezing the ""ice"" phase to get a little more alcohol out, and adding that to the liquid phase and refreezing that to remove a little more water, they get to 44 proof in Applejack."
AskScience,Why are Day/Night temperature changes larger in summer than in winter?,"Some terminology first, what you're describing is usually referred to the 'diurnal temperature range' or DTR (so if you want to poke around more, searching for this along with 'seasonality' will get you much of the relevant literature). 

The pattern you're noticing, i.e., a maximum in DTR during the summer and a minimum during the winter, is characteristic of some (but importantly not all) locations. For example, [Ruschy et al., 1991](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/4/12/1520-0442_1991_004_1211_svidtr_2_0_co_2.xml) found similar patterns in portions of Minnesota and attributed these to tradeoffs between cloud cover, solar radiation intensity, and albedo (from snow) throughout the year. [Schwartz, 1996](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/9/4/1520-0442_1996_009_0803_etsdid_2_0_co_2.xml) found a similar pattern over much of the northeastern US, but added a variety of other possible controls (e.g., seasonal humidity changes, changes in vegetation behavior, etc). 

However, the above is not a global pattern, but rather regional. For example, broader consideration of just the contiguous US highlights three general behaviors (1) the northern and western US have a maximum DTR in the summer and a minimum in the winter, (2) the central and southeastern US have a maximum DTR in the winter and a minimum in the summer, and (3) the mid-latitudes of the US have two maxima in DTR in the spring and fall and two minima in the summer and winter (e.g., [Leathers et al., 1998](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24864530), [Robinson et al., 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016980959400073M)). As with the geographically more limited view from above, a variety of factors (that vary be region) are proposed as causing these different patters in DTR (and subsequent work has proposed even more, e.g., [Durre & Wallace, 2001a](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/14/3/1520-0442_2001_014_0354_twsdid_2.0.co_2.xml), [Dai et al., 1999](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/12/8/1520-0442_1999_012_2451_eocsmp_2.0.co_2.xml), [Portmann et al., 2009](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0808533106)). If you browse many of these, you'll find that common suggested controls are cloudiness, various aspects of the hydrologic cycle (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, etc), and vegetation changes (which are linked to the hydrologic cycle).

Also of note is a wide body of work that highlights that patterns and magnitudes of seasonal DTR are changing as a result of climate change (e.g., [Durre & Wallace, 2001b](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/14/15/1520-0442_2001_014_3263_fitcsd_2.0.co_2.xml), [Balling & Cerveny, 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL017776), etc.) so longer term historical ranges for your (and other) location(s) may differ from more recent seasonal patterns in DTR."
AskScience,Why does mild compression lead to paresthesia but not paralysis?,"While I don't know the full answer, I can assure you that motor deficit does occur with even mild mixed peripheral nerve compression. Weakness and muscle atrophy is a hallmark sign of nerve entrapment, although I agree that sensory effects often seem more immediately noticeable.

Perhaps unconscious proprioceptive feedback circuits modulate motor tone to compensate for mild weakness and ensure normal posture. Or perhaps somatosensory deficit is more bothersome and therefore more consciously noticeable. Or perhaps it has to do with a difference in fiber physiology or myelination. I'd guess it has more to do with the first 2, and its simply that the body is more consciously aware of sensory deficit while mild motor deficit is handled more unconsciously.

Edit: As another person pointed out, the correct answer is that sensory fibers are conveyed around the periphery and motor towards the center of the nerve. Appreciate the love though. I tried my best."
AskScience,"Is there a consistent and objective way to assess the color of an object? A transform function from spectrum to RGB, maybe?","Yes there is and it is important in a great many businesses.  Hunterlabs is probably the largest business centered around color measurement (I know of).  I recommend you click around their website.

In short, there are two main measurement methods, diffuse and ~~spectral~~ specular.  Specular incorporates a surface's texture and will give different measurements for matte and glossy surfaces.  Diffuse will specifically not include gloss effects.

For what the measurements are, they get translated into one of many, many colorspaces.  A colorspace is just a way to define a color numerically.  Often they are based on the limits of perception of the average human eye but not always.  The ones I am most familiar with are Hunterlab's own L* a* b* space and CIE Yxy space.  The ""L*"", ""a*"", ""b*"", ""Y"", ""x"", and ""y"" are the dimensions of the colorspace in much the same way as x, y, and z is in physics."
AskScience,"As they still have a neutral charge, can antineutrons replace neutrons in a regular atom?","No. Antineutrons don't exist in the proverbial vacuum, they're comprised of more fundamental particles called quarks, in this case antiquarks. 

Antineutrons are made of two antidown quarks and one antiup quark. 

A proton is comprised of two up quarks, and a down quark. 

So, if you stick an antineutron in contact with say two regular protons they'll annihlate and, if you're lucky, create a Δ++ baryon that'll decay into a proton and a positively charged pion that'll then decay into a muon and muon neutrino, and then that muon will decay into an electron, an electron neutrino, and an antimuon neutrino that'll annihilate with the muon neutrino that was made when the pion decayed and leave you, ultimately, with a hydrogen atom. 

subatomic physics is weird my man"

AskScience,Do different positions around the globe have distinct and unique magnetic conditions? Could those be used in place of GPS? Would they at all impact native wildlife?,"> Do different positions around the globe have distinct and unique magnetic conditions?

Broadly, yes. The combination of differences in *declination*, i.e., the angle in a horizontal plane (i.e., tangential to the surface of the Earth in the given location) between a given location and the magnetic dip pole (see this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/mag_pole_types/) for a discussion of magnetic dip pole vs geomagnetic pole), *inclination*, i.e., the angle in a vertical plane (i.e., normal to the horizontal plane in which declination is measured) between a given location and the magnetic dip pole, and *magnetic field intensity* would be largely unique for any given place. For example, if we consider maps of [declination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Dcolourful.jpg), [inclination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Icolourful.jpg), and intensity (which we can break into [horizontal](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Hcolourful.jpg) and [vertical](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Zcolourful.jpg) components), we can see that we can just measuring declination and inclination would probably give you a pretty exact location and if we added intensity, we could potentially increase precision and accuracy.

> Could those be used in place of GPS?

Technically, maybe yes, but it would be pretty annoying/challenging to do so. The first thing to consider that you would need pretty precise measurements of the inclination and declination of a location to distinguish it from nearby locations. From a practical standpoint, if we look at those maps from above, lines of constant declination and inclination (or intensity) are pretty 'wiggly' (for lack of a better term), and thus not nearly as intuitive as traditional coordinate systems that we use. I.e., it's pretty intuitive to understand what is implied by a difference in X degrees latitude or longitude (or X meters east or north in a projected coordinate system) and similarly mathematically simple to calculate distances between points in those coordinate systems, but less so if we were thinking about X degrees of magnetic inclination or magnetic declination because lines of constant inclination or declination are contorted.

 More problematically, because of [geomagnetic secular variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_secular_variation), for a given location, values of declination, inclination, and intensity change on relatively short timescales, e.g., maps of the rate of change of [declination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dDcolourful.jpg), [inclination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dIcolourful.jpg), [horizontal intensity](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dHcolourful.jpg), or [vertical intensity](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dZcolourful.jpg) give you a sense that you'd be having to constantly adjust your coordinates for anything of moderate precision.

 Now, depending on the details of the traditional geographic coordinate systems used (and the locations considered), there is also ""drift"" in coordinates because of absolute and relative plate motions, but these are generally smaller rates of change and thus necessitate less frequent updates to coordinate systems than if we used a magnetic position/intensity based coordinate system."
AskScience,Bell's Inequality (and related experiments) shows realness and locality can't both be true. Most of the discussions I see prefer to keep locality and forego with realism. Why? Are we just being deferential to Einstein's aversion to spooky action at a distance?,"Special relativity would force locality at a conceptual level. It's not merely that causation can't move too fast, it's that literally different inertial frame of reference would register 2 events in different time order, so if you claim that something is a ""cause"", in certain frame of reference the effect happen before the cause.

We have theories that accept realism and forgo locality: de Broglie-Bohm's pilot wave theory. It does have some supports. However, the issue with such theories is that it's hard to incorporate that with special relativity into an overarching theory that can handle particles moving at relativistic speed. Physicists were able to combine both quantum mechanics and special relativity together and it had been extremely successful at making predictions, so until we have evidences otherwise, we should accept that special relativity is correct and can be combined with quantum mechanic."
AskScience,Do all planets in our solar system have their magnetic North/South poles the same way up as Earth?,"No, for a bunch of reasons.

1) Not all planets (and moons) have global magnetic fields at all.  Mars, for instance, only has weird patterns of [local magnetic fields](https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/58555-crustal-fields-on-mars) caused by magnetized parts of the rocks in the upper crust.  Walk a few dozen miles on Mars, and your compass might point in a totally different direction.  Other planets, like Venus, appear to have no measurable internal field at all -- at least nothing we've been able to measure from orbit.

2) Even the planets that do have strong internal magnetic fields aren't aligned with Earth.  For example, [Jupiter's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter) points roughly the opposite direction from Earth's.  For right now, anyway, because:

3) Not all planets have internally-generated fields that are stable over a long time.  [Earth's field](https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3104/flip-flop-why-variations-in-earths-magnetic-field-arent-causing-todays-climate-change), for instance, reverses direction every few tens of thousands to millions of years.  Other planets with strong internal fields might do this too, and if they do they won't keep the same schedule.

4) Not all planets have fields that are stable over even a *short* time.  [Europa](https://europa.nasa.gov/resources/174/induced-magnetic-field-from-europas-subsurface-ocean/), for instance, has a field that's not generated internally, but is created by magnetic induction created by changes in *Jupiter's* field.  So the field changes in sync with Jupiter's rotation rate.  Venus has a field that's created by the collision between the solar wind and the planet's atmosphere, and so it depends on the Sun's solar activity."
AskScience,"When nerve damage occurs, where is the pain perceived? at the site of damage or at the end of the nerve?","There are no pain receptors in the trunk of the nerve, only at the ends. Pinch the ulnar nerve at the elbow and you get pins and needles along the underside of the arm and last 2 fingers, not at the elbow.

You can open the skull and stimulate the postcentral gyrus directly, and the sensation will be from the foot, not the head.

AskScience,"If the fuel that goes in car engines is extracted from hydrocarbons, which consist of only Hydrogen and Carbon, and those hydrocarbons react with Oxygen in the air (combustion reaction), to produce CO2 and H2O, why do we get a bad smell from car exhaust fumes if both gases are odorless?","As you note, a car's gasoline engine converts hydrocarbons and air into CO2 and H2O, both odorless, providing the energy that makes the car go.  But there is also nitrogen in the air in the combustion chamber.  And although we think of N2 as inert, a small amount does get incorporated into the oxidation chain reaction, to form a mixture of nitrogen oxides, NOx.  This, along with unburnt hydrocarbons, lead to smog, so catalytic converters were developed to combat this.  

Modern [Three-way Catalytic Converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter#Three-way) not only convert CO to the less toxic, CO2, and oxidize any remaining hydrocarbons; they also reduce most of the NOx back to N2.  But a small amount of NOx gets reduced to ammonia, NH3, as a side product.  And NH3 has a noticeable, pungent smell down to 5 parts per million in air.

And although gasoline is primarily composed of hydrocarbons, there **are** traces of other elements:  inhibitors and detergent additives, along with residual sulfur compounds.  And whatever sulfur there is, winds up as hydrogen sulfide, H2S, after the catalytic converter.   The sulfur level in gasoline should be pretty low now days, [below 10 ppm](https://www.epa.gov/gasoline-standards/gasoline-sulfur), so this may not sound like much of a problem, but H2S becomes noticeable as a rotten egg smell below 0.1 ppm.

These traces of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are primarily responsible for the bad smell you notice."

AskScience,If a human being is bleeding internally say in their mouth or stomach would they still have a risk of anemia?,"Yes.  Not all the iron is reabsorbed.  One of the marks of a bleeding ulcer, or injured gut is that your crap turns black from the extra blood.  Indeed you can bleed to death from a stomach ulcer if it perforates into a vein.  


But even if the leak is slow:  The average blood cell lives about 6 weeks.  Then it's broken down, the iron salvaged and rerouted to make more blood.  So if you are bleeding at a rate faster than 1/6 of your blood per week, or aobut 2.5% per day, your body will fall behind.

It's never that easy.  If the change is slow, your body can ramp up blood cell production some.  So you might be able to keep up with 3% per day.  But not likely 5%"
AskScience,Is blood toxic to neurons ?,"Neurons, especially in the CNS (brain/spinal cord), are quite sensitive, and are usually kept in a sheltered environment separated from the blood by the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes and other glial cells provide a controlled environment for the neurons. They do take nutrients from the blood, but they act as a filter to only let through the right things and in the concentrations that neurons prefer.

Even in other tissues, blood isn't usually supposed to leave the blood vessels, and can cause trouble if it does. Perhaps the easiest to understand is coagulation - if everything's clotted up, that will disrupt whatever else is supposed to be happening in that tissue. There are also immune molecules which tend to get activated and cause inflammation when outside blood vessels. Inflammation generally interferes with regular tissue function, and CNS neurons are particularly sensitive to it.

Blood also contains higher concentrations of stuff like iron that would damage neurons."
AskScience,Is there an evolutionary reason behind deciduous trees’ vibrant fall colours?,">I’d always just assumed “that’s the colour of a maple leaf without the chlorophyll bits,” but I’m realizing now that that seems naive.

That's actually pretty much it. Leaves don't just have chlorophyll serving as an energy acceptor from sunlight but also other antioxidants in less concentration who accept energy from red and yellow, but also from green light unlike chlorophylls who accept red, yellow and violet light.

[Here is the absorption spectra of chlorophyll A and B as well as Beta-Carotine](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephane-Jacquemoud/publication/40799750/figure/fig1/AS:339873459392513@1458043555607/upper-Differences-in-absorption-spectra-of-chlorophyll-a-chlorophyll-b-and-b-carotene.png). You'll notice that Beta-carotine absorpts quite a bit of green light.

Once it becomes fall, trees notice a change in the red light ratio during dusk and dawn and begin a process that is called ""reverse clorophyll biosynthesis"". Because chlorophyll is a very expensive molecule plants don't really degrade it. They save it from the leaves and suck it up into the wood, where it stays in a different form for the winter. That's why the leaves, now empty of chlorophyll, have this yellow and red color. Once the leaf loses the antioxidants as well, it becomes brown and dies. The chlorophyll will become active again in spring and will provide energy again in new leafs.

So the vibrant colors are not really a signal for anything. Just a change in light accepting molecules."
AskScience,Does having history of heat illness (especially heat stroke) make one’s body more sensitive to heat?,[removed]
AskScience,Why is that we only see one side of the moon?,"The short answer is that the Moon rotates on its axis exactly once for every time it orbits the Earth. When it has travelled half way around its orbit, it has also rotated half way, so it still shows us the same side.

The mechanism that has caused this is a process called tidal locking, which is a complicated interaction between the gravity of Earth pulling on the Moon and slowing its rotation until it matched the period of its orbit."

AskScience,Why do immune reactions take place in the lymph nodes closest to the site of infection?,"Your body has dendritic cells in basically every tissue, so when an infection happens the dendritic cell will mature and lose its adhesion to the tissue.

Your lymp nodes also monitor the lymph for antigens, so the closest ones to the infection site will get the most of them and will react the most due to the higher concentration"
AskScience,What happens to a piece of a neutron star?,"Another approach to answering this question is that when two neutron stars collide, in the resulting explosion called a ""[kilonova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilonova),"" a portion of the neutron stars' matter gets thrown off.  This thrown off, decompressing degenerate neutron star matter initiates what is called the ""[r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process)"" or ""rapid neutron-capture process"" which is pretty much the only way atoms bigger than Iron are forged.

AskScience,How do Palaeontologists build image of an organism from fossils? How accurate is their method?,"Not a paleontologist but Comparative anatomy gives a lot of insight into fossils - e.g. Proportionally long legs (specifically lower legs) correspond to animals adapted for speed or sprinting. Robust bones are indicative of heavy set animals with lots of muscle of fat. Unusually dense bones can be indicative of aquatic animals.
  
 The texture of the bones themselves can reveal even more information - deeper scarring on muscle attachment sites means beefier muscles in that area; rugosities and landmarks on the bones can reveal places where keratin sheathes would anchor to or where blood vessels flow. Quill knobs are seen where feathers anchor on some dinosaurs.
 
Some fossils are preserved well enough to preserve scales, skin and feathers. A handful of fossils even preserve melanosomes which determines colour. Evolution also leaves lots of remnants of a species' ancestry behind - for example: pliosaur, crocodile and spinosaur teeth are extremely similar but theropod (the group of Dinosaurs spinosaurus belongs to) teeth are flat with serrated edges, so even though spinosaurus teeth are evolved convergently to other fish-eating animals, they have subtle remnants of traits only seen on theropod teeth, in this case being slightly less circular and having faint ridges where the serrated edge used to be. Teeth themselves are hugely informative of diet and environment too to the point that microscopic wear marks can tell you how a herbivore moves its mouth! In mammals, the patterns in teeth is even more unique (compare the pattern on an elephant molar to a cow to a human).
 
All these things offer different pieces of the puzzle. Phylogenetic bracketing takes all these clues, adaptions and identifying features and models the most likely relationships, this can then reveal where along the chain certain traits pop up (for example, feather-like filaments have been found across a range of distantly related dinosaur and even pterosaurs, indicating that all dinosaurs probably evolved from an animal with some level of proto-feathers). All of this can also be compared with chemical isotope analyses of fossils and the formations they are found in, to build up an even better picture."
AskScience,How can water molecules be dipolar?,"There's two parts to the answer. First, the molecule is H-O-H as you say. In the simplistic picture of chemical bonds, each hydrogen shares its electron with one from the oxygen to make the bond. But the sharing isn't equal, the  oxygen has eight positively charged  protons against the hydrogen's one. So the negative electrons get more attracted to the oxygen so that has a small negative excess and the hydrogens a small positive one. Like this:-

H^d+ - O^d- - H^d+

So far so good. But the molecule isn't linear, its bent at an angle of 104.5 degrees like a wide V. So the tips of the V have the positive charges and the apex the negative one. So there's a charge dipole running vertically (as drawn like a V) from apex to tip."

AskScience,Are the tectonic plates in different areas on the planet now compared to millions of years ago?,"Some of the more basic aspects underlying your question are covered in various bits of our (pretty extensive) set of [FAQs related to Plate Tectonics](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/#wiki_plate_tectonics_and_earth_structure) (e.g., general drivers and properties of plate motion). Two of your more specific questions are not directly addressed, so we'll touch on those:

**1.**  If the plates are constantly moving, does that mean they are in different locations now when compared to where they where millions of years ago?

**Yes, in both a relative and absolute sense.** What that statement means is that the plates are in different positions both *relative to each other*, e.g., individual plates have moved closer to, further away from, and/or changed their orientations with respect to each other between the past and present, but also *relative to a fixed reference frame* like the center of the Earth which we discuss as an absolute reference frame, e.g., if we hold latitude and longitude fixed with respect to the rotational axes of the Earth the position of any given spot on a tectonic plate has (generally) changed its coordinates through time reflecting absolute motion of that plate. Also of relevance, plates are changing shape through time as well as portions of given plates are subducted or underthrust, created at mid-ocean ridges, and/or captured by / loss to other plates. Similarly, new plates can form through a variety of means (see our FAQ for a discussion) and plates can be completely destroyed. As an example, [this visualization](https://portal.gplates.org/cesium/?view=AgeGrid) tracks plate boundaries (and extent/age of sea floor) for the last 230 million years (easier to see if you switch to the ""2D Map"" option in the upper right). In this, you can see that creation, destruction, change of shape, and translation/rotation of plates in both a relative and absolute sense.

**2.** Does the extent of mountain formation of two plates colliding cover more ground than the exact point of collision?

**Also yes.** Almost all plate boundaries are better described as zones. While for all of them, we can identify a single structure that represents the plate boundary in the sense of ""on this side is plate X and on this side is plate Y"", if we consider the *deformation* associated with the plate boundary and plate interaction, then it's almost never a single structure (and which structure represents that transition from plate X to plate Y can change through time, i.e., move within the zone of deformation). The width of the zone varies depending on plate boundary kinematics and type of lithosphere involved (generally). Divergent and transform boundaries between oceanic lithosphere (i.e., mid-ocean ridges or oceanic transforms) are very discrete and may be pretty close to a single fault. Divergent and transform boundaries between continental lithosphere are narrow, but will typically be a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide (e.g., the [East African Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift) or [San Andreas Fault System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#Fault_zones), respectively). Convergent boundaries between oceanic lithosphere are again relatively narrow (at the surface), but can span 10s to 100s of kilometers (e.g., [accretionary wedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretionary_wedge)). 

Finally, most relevant to your question, convergent boundaries between continental lithosphere (or oceanic and continental) tend to be very diffuse, e.g., consider the width of the topographic expression of the Andes, Himalaya, Arabia-Eurasia collision, etc.). Some of this width reflects distributed deformation within one or both plates (e.g., the modern plate boundary between India-Eurasia is effectively at the southern edge of the Himalaya, but active deformation extends all the way to the northern margin of Tibet). Some of this width also reflects that what is simplified as a single plate for lay audiences is actually better considered to be broken up into many [minor or microplates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tectonic_plates). For example, the Greater Caucasus lie > 1000 km north of what's considered the modern Arabia-Eurasia plate boundary (i.e., the Bitlis-Zagros suture in southern Turkey and northern Iraq), but in reality, the area between the Bitlis-Zagros suture and the northern margin of the Greater Caucasus effectively represent a suite of microplates that are moving independently of both the main Arabian and Eurasian plates (e.g., [Reilinger et al., 2006](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JB004051)).

As a technical aside, the two options above also sort of represent two general end-member views of how continents deform (or how we can describe their deformation through time), specifically, is it better/more correct to consider discrete plate boundaries between large plates but where the edges of those plates deform broadly (i.e., a continuum model) OR to subdivide edges of plates into smaller largely independent plate like features (i.e., a microplate model) - or some combination of the two. This debate has been going on in the tectonics community for decades (e.g., [Thatcher, 1995](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB03064)). The extent to whether it's resolved (and the ""right"" answer) depends on who you ask (personally, I largely consider it a timescale issue, i.e., continuum models work better for long-term generalizations but microplate models are appropriate for shorter-term (few million years) generalizations)."
AskScience,How do fishes get into isolated inland lakes in the first place? and why don't we see more divergent evolution / speciation given the separation of each group of fishes from each other?,"The answer to this question was only recently discovered.  It was always understood that water birds played a role, but it was assumed that they transferred fish eggs on their feet.  [New research suggests that a small percentage of fish eggs survive digestion by ducks.  And ducks eat a large number of fish eggs, which are tiny.](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-eggs-can-hatch-after-being-eaten-pooped-out-ducks#:~:text=For%20fish%20eggs%2C%20getting%20gobbled,places%2C%20a%20new%20study%20finds.)"
AskScience,"During a viral infection, infectiousness reaches a peak and then declines. Is this solely attributable to declining viral load or are there other factors at play?","Yes, to some extent the drop-off in infectivity is greater than the drop-off of virus production. What can happen is that new virus can be produced and shed by infected cells, but the immune system can neutralize the virus before it can transmit to a new host.   In most cases this will be because of antibody binding to the newly-produced virus, but I think you’d get a similar effect in e.g. the APOBEC3-driven mutations seen in some infections. 

An example of antibodies neutralizing infectious virus is probably in COVID infections. It’s common for PCR or sensitive antigen testing to detect virus shedding for quite a long time after the infection starts, even though this virus is not infectious."
AskScience,Can the human body clear a HPV infection copletely?,"Your body can clear it over time and you should get checked yearly. Also, the HPV vaccine protects against over 9 strains that cause warts or ones that can rarely lead to cancers. Get the vaccine, it’ll help prevent other strains."
AskScience,What happens to blood left outside the body over time?,The blood cells would essentially burst and spill their contents. The iron would be released from the hemoglobin. The iron would oxidize and become a brownish color. The plasma and other stuff would essentially just evaporate.
AskScience,How is O2 introduced to blood in the alveoli?,"It's via diffusion, the deoxygenated blood has a higher affinity for the oxygen and the haemoglobin will bind to the oxygen easily.

Diffusion isn't very efficient, hence needing a very high surface area and very thin capillary walls in the alveoli.

The blood travels along enough of this diffusion-optimised path to ensure (in a healthy person) that almost all the blood becomes saturated."
AskScience,What exactly is a microstate?,"Discrete counting of microstates makes sense in a quantum context, where the energy states are quantized. In this case, given a macrostates, you can compute the number of microstates consistent with that macrostate. So in a quantum mechanical treatment, you can count everything just fine in principle. In practice though, we often typically course grain over everything and don’t necessarily count things discretely. So we’ll use something like the density of states etc. to help us. 

In a purely classical context, of course, we don’t have discrete counting of microstates for the reason you mention. If we wish to resolve this in a purely classical sense, we typically define entropy in a different but analogous way. 


For discrete systems, the general Gibbs entropy for non-equilibrium is defined as

     S = - k \sum p ln(p)

where p is the probability of any given microstate and we sum over all microstates. From this you can obtain the Boltzmann formula S = k ln(Omega) (the argument is that equal probabilities for each microstate maximizes the entropy). 

Now, for a continuous system, we define it very similarly. For something like a classical gas, we can just use something called the distribution function, which is solved via the Boltzmann or Fokker-Planck equation. The distribution function essentially tells you the probability density of any given microstate. As an easy example, the Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic distribution function is

      f(x, v) = n (2 pi m / k T)^3/2 exp(- m v^2 / 2 k T). 

Here, n is number density, and the density and temperature are functions of position. The number of particles within a certain volume d^3 x and a phase space volume d^3 v is 

      dN = f d^3x d^3 v 

(In stat-mech we typically use momentum as a coordinate, but in kinetics we typically use velocity as a coordinate.) So if we want to calculate the total energy, we could count up the energy of every particle:

      U = \int 1/2 m v^2 dN 

(We can also compute the average energy per particle instead and so on.) 

We now define the entropy. The entropy for a non-equilibrium distribution function is given by:

      S = -k \int ln(f) f d^3x d^3v

(This is ignoring factors of Planck’s constant and so on, because we’re working in a purely classical context.) This is the entropy as defined in Boltzmann’s H-theorem. Importantly, S is a *functional*: it takes a function f as input and outputs a scalar. One can show via Lagrange multipliers that given the constraint of constant number of particles and constant energy (with 0 net momentum), the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is the function that maximizes the entropy. This is how we know the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is the classical equilibrium distribution. 

Notice that the formula is essentially the same as the -k ln(p) p formula, we’re just using the distribution function and integrating. One can make this connection more precise if you realize that course graining the quantum system will lead to a similar expression as the classical one (with appropriate factors of Planck’s constant and so on). 

For more information, I would read up on the Boltzmann H-theorem.

To put more concretely: in general non-equilibrium, entropy is a measure based on the probability  distribution of microstates. Essentially, S is the average of - k ln(p). For discrete states, you perform a discrete sum over all states given the discrete probability distribution. For continuous states, you perform an integral over all states given the continuous probability distribution."
AskScience,What actually makes new ADP or ATP?,"ATP/ADP have two major components, the ribose sugar and the adenine nucleobase. The ribose sugar (as ribose-5-phosphate) is made from glucose-6-phosphate via the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose_phosphate_pathway), an enzymatic pathway similar to glycolysis that is used to convert glucose into 5-carbon sugars used for other purposes while generating a bit of energy.

Ribose-5-phosphate serves as the starting point for [purine biosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine_metabolism#Biosynthesis), in which a series of enzymes assemble the nucleobase portion directly on top of the ribose sugar, with most of the atoms necessary coming from various amino acids or molecules from the Krebs cycle. The pathway shown there only goes up to AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which will be phosphorylated to make ADP, then phosphorylated one more time to make ATP.

These pathways are nearly universal, with nearly all known organisms being able to make their own ATP. So while it's a complicated and metabolically expensive process, and organisms prefer to reuse existing ATP/ADP when they can, it's clearly important for them to have the ability to make more when they need to."
AskScience,The question about the age of the Earth lead me to wondering how we figured out the half lives of some of these isotopes?,"You measure the decay over a given time period and extrapolate from that.
Of course, for super long half life isotopes only a tiny % of atoms will decay in a practical timescale but we are assisted by the fact that there are many billions of atoms in a sample and a tiny % of a huge number is still a big enough number to work with."
AskScience,Can sparks form in space?,"Yes, but they would take slightly longer to cool until they hit the surface.

Sparks aren't generally caused by the rock/metal burning as it's sawn (most rocks can't even oxidize any further), but rather shards of the material just being *really* hot because the saw is using kinetic energy to break the bonds in it, and that energy (both from the saw and the broken bonds) must go *somewhere*. They'll stay hotter a bit longer because there's no air to conduct heat away from them (though they will radiate heat). Once they hit the surface of the moon, they'll cool off and stop glowing very quickly (like they would on Earth) as they dump their heat into the regolith.

Even some oxidation sparks (like from fireworks) would work\* in a vacuum, ~~and they might even work better~~. Black powder has its oxidizer mixed in, so it doesn't actually need air to burn and would keep going just fine (once lit). It will go out if you douse it with water, but that's because the water cools it off, rather than smothering it. ~~So black powder may burn even faster in a vacuum (though it would vary with composition\*\*, so it's hard to say~~). Edit: It would probably be slower or equal for most applications because the air is either mostly absent already (when densely packed) or acting to transfer heat.

&#x200B;

\*As was pointed out [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15nmagi/comment/jvp8ihh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): the lack of atmosphere would also make it harder for heat to transfer from one grain of powder to the other, so this also depends heavily on how the grain is packed. A fuse would still burn, but loose powder or a firework might not (or at least, not well). I was thinking purely from a chemistry standpoint, from which black powder is a bit like rocket fuel in that it brings its oxidizer with it, but the physical configuration of actual black powder devices (made by packing individual grains) is important."
AskScience,"Did Venus once have an atmosphere like Earth, and are volcanoes the reason that changed?","There's evidence that Venus was basically covered in lava due to tremendous volcanic activity around 500M years ago. So much that it was basically resurfaced by the lava outflows and the solidified lava became the new surface of the planet. Needless to say, anything even approaching that level of volcanic activity would release enough carbon dioxide to send Venus into a runaway greenhouse climate if it wasn't already there in the first place. 

Scientists are divided on whether the resurfacing event 500M years ago was an isolated incident or the latest in a string of resurfacing events throughout the planet's history. There is no active plate tectonics on Venus today. The leading hypotheses on plate tectonics is that large amounts of liquid water are crucial in allowing continents to slide past one another (due to how water affects mineral formation, rock grain size and other factors that influence subduction and heat exchange from the mantle to the crust). Depending on when the Venusian oceans boiled away, plate tectonics could have stopped very early in the planet's history or in the lead up to the latest resurfacing event 500M years ago. When plate tectonics stops happening, heat cannot really be transfered out from the core & mantle nearly as effectively. That heat builds up until the crust fractures catastrophically and the built up heat and pressure escapes all at once as lava in a massive, planet-wide resurfacing event.

The loss of oceans on Venus also meant that geologic weathering stopped, preventing the main way to remove carbon dioxide from the planet's atmosphere. It could very well be that Venus might have been habitable and may have had primitive life in its oceans. Maybe the loss of its magnetic field caused the oceans to slowly be lost to space to kick the whole process off. Or maybe the primitive life on Venus never managed to get photosynthesis figured out and the planet slipped into an unstoppable runaway greenhouse as the Sun increased in brightness over billions of years. Venus was most likely made from the same kinds, amounts and ratios of materials the Earth was, so the planetary ""ingredients"" were very similar starting out.

The funny thing is, Earth experienced several major glaciations where thick ice caps basically expanded to the equator and the entire planet was covered in ice. The latest round of these severe ice ages happened right around the time Venus' oceans could have been boiling away or even within a few million years of Venus' last resurfacing event itself. How depressing or absolutely misleading it would have been if any interstellar explorers or probes visited the two planets during this time. One planet was a noxious hellhole with temperatures so high, METALLIC SNOW fell on its highest mountaintops. And the next planet out from the Sun was a frozen wasteland way colder than Antarctica is today, and could have been locked in a deep freeze for tens of millions of years at a time. Any notion of a ""Goldilocks Zone"" in our Solar System would be unthinkable given the contrast of these two planets even though they were not that much different initially."
AskScience,Did the beginning of the latest Ice Age cause widespread extinction?,"The short answer is the end of the last glacial period is a bit unique within the Pleistocene (where the end of the last glacial period also represented the end of the Pleistocene) with respect to extinctions, i.e., most prior glacial-interglacial cycles (at either end, i.e., going from glacial to interglacial or interglacial to glacial) did not result in an extinction. It was in part this observation, i.e., that the extinction at the end of the Pleistocene killed off a variety of megafauna that had survived various glacial-interglacial cycles throughout the Pleistocene, led to the development of the ""overkill"" hypothesis, i.e., that since these megafauna had lived through prior glacial-interglacial cycles, a climatic trigger for the extinction was unlikely and that the coincidence of this with the spread of human populations might be related (e.g., [Steadman et al., 2005](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0502777102)). 

However, there are a variety of issues with the overkill hypothesis and more broadly it wasn't just megafauna that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene (e.g., [Jackson & Weng, 1999](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.96.24.13847)), no two glacial-interglacial cycles are exactly the same (e.g., [Meltzer, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2015032117)), and relatedly the way individual species respond via range shift etc. to climatic triggers varies and can either go well or badly (e.g., [Lister & Stuart, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631071308000928)). Thus, generally while not a coherent consensus exists as yet, there is likely sort of a unique set of factors (both climatic and other) that led to the particular glacial-interglacial transition to become an extinction event."
AskScience,Why are seashells shaped the way they are?,"It's actually controlled by only a few simple parameters and differential growth.  Basically, imagine you're a snail starting out with a teeny tiny shell like a cone.  You want to grow the shell as you do.  If you grow evenly, you just get a long, straight cone.  But if you grow one side faster than the other, you get a curve.  The bigger the discrepancy, the tighter the curve, until you get a tight spiral.  Now add a ""bias"" in, so that you not only curve, but shift to the right or left as you do.  Boom, conical snail shell.  All of these various shapes are just the product of a few parameters about growth rates varying."
AskScience,How do insects survive winter? How do northenly climates have any insects?,"First there are billions of insects and billions of individuals will not survive winter.

Different species adopt different strategies to get through. Some rely on their eggs to carry the species on; they lay them in sheltered places: under tree bark, leaf litter, underground. Some attempt to find sheltered places to hibernate. Some allow their entire population to die off leaving only the fertile queen to make it to Spring."
AskScience,"If humans originated and then migrated from Africa, did all other primates do so as well?","When you talk about these groups of organisms on the tree of life, what you're talking about are called clades. Graphically, you can think of it as encompassing one complete branch on the tree, starting at some given extinct species, all of the species which descend from it, and *only* the species which descend from it. A proper clade is referred to as monophyletic (""one phylum""), which means it satisfies the above requirements. In the past (especially before the advent of comparative genomics), the scientific community sometimes grouped together species on the basis of abstractly similar traits of behaviors. For example, whales were at one time ""grouped"" with sharks. However, if we look at the evolutionary ancestry of each of these groups, we see that they don't share a remotely recent common ancestor, and that each lineage has vastly different morphological histories. Groups like this are called paraphyletic, generally implying incorrectness, meaning they encompass a general phenotype but do not reflect shared descent.

Primates are a taxonomic group called an order, and we do consider them to be monophyletic, meaning all primates descend from one species, and order Primates includes all descendant species of that ancestor. There are several other groupings within this order, such as Hominini, which includes ourselves, chimpanzees, and bonobos, and likewise we consider all species within Hominini to descend from a common ancestor, and that Hominini contains all descendant species. Of course, we are always adding to the fossil record and so the actual inclusions and organization of the tree is always improving to better reflect the most recent data. The question of the first true primate, for example, is pretty hotly debated, but generally considered to have lived on the order of 70 million years ago. We have a lot of fossil evidence but almost all of it seems to arise after this earliest split happened, and extended periods of interbreeding while two species are on their way to more permanent separation clouds the ability of our genetic tools to pinpoint the last split, which is also true for the most recent common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. Whatever the case, the clade itself originated in the late Cretaceous, contemporary to the last of the non-avian dinosaurs and the KT extinction event if you want a general idea of the timeline. This is a very long time ago and plenty of time for primates to migrate across the globe and extensively diversify, even though they still share a common ancestor."
AskScience,Do cats and dogs see things under blacklight the same as we do?,"Black light glows are caused by (might get the term wrong) fluorescence, where the high energy photons of the black light excite certain molecules into releasing a burst of photons at a different wavelength (the glow you see is when that new wavelength is in the visible spectrum). So as long as what’s glowing is within the animal’s color spectrum, they should have no problem seeing it. However, an animal (like a pistol shrimp) may not quite see the same glow from black lights because it may be washed out by the brightness of the black light, as their vision extends much further into the ultraviolet (and also the infrared, but UV is what’s relevant here) than humans’ do"
AskScience,"Why do cosmologists say that gravity should ""slow down"" the expansion of the universe?","Locally, the expansion of the universe still obeys the first law of thermodynamics: considering a fixed proper volume of space, expansion acts to dilute the energy density within that volume, doing work in the process.

The energy to do this ""comes from"" the expansion, which means it slows down over time in the situation where there are attractive forces (i.e. gravity) associated with the energy density. Conversely the present-day universe has its energy density dominated by dark energy, which behaves as a repulsive force which ads energy to the expansion, accelerating it.

For a rigorous derivation of this behaviour your best bet is to get an introductory cosmology textbook and look into the Friedmann equations."
AskScience,"Is it possible that only 4 moose imported to Newfoundland in 1904 could produce a viable modern population of 110,000 today?","Certainly it’s possible, though not inevitable. Small inbred populations can persist in spite of small founder populations - the classic examples are [island foxes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415705/), and island populations are the best studied. 

Populations can survive inbreeding better if they have a longish history of smallish (but not too small) populations. This leads to long periods of low-level inbreeding, and that leads to [purging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_purging) of deleterious genes. In other words, a long period of mild inbreeding can accidentally prepare a population for a shorter period of severe inbreeding. 

Moose are actually good candidates for this, because they arose during periods of glaciation, which presumably led to small populations that would alternate periods of inbreeding and then as the ice allowed intermingling and new gene flow. 

Is this what actually happened? I don’t know, but the principles are pretty well understood and if your question is *could* this happen, certainly it could. Since there obviously *are* moose on Newfoundland, the alternative is denying reality or positing some clandestine moose-smuggling operation, so this is the simplest answer.

AskScience,Why does sand keep clay from shrinking as it dries?,"Same idea as bricks and mortar for building a house - the bricks are the structural support and the mortar is the fluid stuff holding the bricks together.

Same idea as adding *grog* to your clay.

Microscale, clay particles shaped like little flat overlapping discs. Place your hands over each other and then imagine 10 people all overlapping hands to do a big Lets Go Team! cheer. They are also charged like magnets.  The water in the clay is phsycially separating the clay particles so they can slide over each other and be worked.

When you are working the clay it is wet and all the little charged discs are pushing each other away.  However, when you are drying the clay (biscuit phase) or firing, the water evaporates.  All those little charged discs start to be attracted to each other and pull together.  

Some types of clay have what's called a ""vitreous component"" or a ""flux"" - it's just naturally in the type of clay, although it can be an additive too.  It's stuff inside the clay that melts during firing and turns into glass.  Sounds great, but the solid->liquid phase change is smaller volume so it makes little bubbles inside the clay wall.  

Overall, the clay shrinks and pressure starts to build up in the walls.

The grog or sand is an inert piece of material that slow down shrinkage and reduces internal pressure in the clay structure.

Now, with this grog additive, during firing some of the clay melts to form a fluid glass that moves to fill in the voids between the solid grog.  Other clay melts to fill that hole, and so on.  You end up with a much stronger piece of clay with less shrinkage and much less likely to shatter to relieve that internal pressure."
AskScience,Why does the Moon cause a water bulge on the far side of Earth?,"The far-side bulge is less intuitive. Since gravity's force decreases with distance, the gravitational pull on the far side of the Earth (the side away from the Moon) is less strong than the pull on the side of the Earth that's directly facing the Moon. In essence, the gravitational force is pulling the solid Earth more than it is pulling the water on the far side, effectively ""leaving behind"" a bulge of water on the opposite side. This effect, combined with the Earth's rotation, causes a second high tide on the side of the Earth farthest from the Moon."
AskScience,How does DNA encode 3d space/information?,"A lot of the answers here are long.

AskScience,How do tailorbirds learn to sow their nests? And how is this information passed on across generations?,"Years ago some scientists did an experiment with a similar species. 

They raised something like 8 generations in cages with pre-built artificial nests but no nesting material. They were denied nesting behaviors to prove that they could not learn it. 

Then the final generation were given nesting material and no artificial nests. The built a nest with the materials provided, and generally in the same manner as their ancestors. 

Short answer: quite a lot in instinctual for elaborate nest builders. BUT in species where males build nests to impress females, there’s also a learning curve. They start building nests from an early age, but making a swank nest that a female finds sexy can take years of practice"
AskScience,When measuring the wavelength of EM radiation... what's actually being measured?,"I'm an EE grad student, who's specializing in microwaves and antenna theory.

So a good way to think about this, is that changes in the Electric and Magnetic fields don't propagate instantly; they travel at the speed of light. So if I turn on an electromagnet, it will take some time for any metal near it to feel that force. Even though that time will probably be measured in nanoseconds, it still takes a nonzero time between the magnet being energized, and for the metal to feel the magnetic force.

Now imagine an antenna as a tiny electromagnet that's being flipped from positive to negative billions of times a second in a sinusoidal pattern (this is an ***EXTREME*** oversimplification of what an antenna is, but for the purposes of this discussion, it's enough). The changes in the field will only propagate at the speed of light, but the magnet is changing extremely fast.

This makes it so that if you take a snapshot of the magnetic field at a single instant, you will see the field shift from positive to negative to positive to negative with distance from the antenna. If you measure the distance it takes to go from positive to negative to positive again, that's your wavelength.

[Here's a gif of an ANSYS simulation I made of the Electric Field of a simple dipole antenna over time.](https://giphy.com/gifs/3FV06I4oUIj9P4hrqT) You can see the wave-like pattern in the field magnitude.

AskScience,How does light factor into gravity models?,"The overall energy density of light today is about one ten thousandth (10^(-4)) that of matter or dark energy. Thus, its contribution to the overall spacetime curvature is negligible.

That was not always the case, though. Despite all of the light emitted in galaxies, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) still dominates the energy density in radiation (see for example the first figure in [this article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.150555)). This is not light that was ""emitted"" per se; rather it is left over from a time when the universe was much hotter and denser. Between a few minutes and roughly 50000 years, this light dominated the energy density of the universe. (In particular, the energy density was about 60% photons and 40% neutrinos.)

The gravitational influence of this radiation (that is, its influence on spacetime curvature) led to a different cosmic expansion history. When radiation dominates, cosmic expansion decelerates more efficiently than when matter dominates (the size scales as time^(1/2) rather than time^(2/3)).

Another major impact of radiation domination is that structure growth is suppressed. Matter can cluster, so for example, any small density excess tends to pull in surrounding matter, becoming even denser. That's what is meant by the growth of structure. However, radiation cannot cluster, so when radiation dominates, structures grow much less efficiently."
AskScience,What’s the true color of the sun?,"Excellent article over here by NASA:  


[https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/what-color-sun](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/what-color-sun)

&#x200B;

A couple of highlights:

* The sun emits light at all wavelengths (colors), but most strongly at around 500 nm (blue-green).
* The color that we perceive the sun to be depends on whether we observe the sun from the surface of the Earth (beneath the atmosphere), or from space (above the atmosphere).
* If we observe the sun from space, the sun will appear to be white. This is because we are observing all of the sun's individual colors combined together into white light.
* If we observe the sun from the surface of the earth or beneath the atmosphere, the atmosphere tends to scatter blue light. This means that less blue light gets to your eyes to see, and so the sun appears more toward the yellow and orange end of the spectrum."
AskScience,Does your body develop a “pee safety” mechanism for sleeping as you get older?,"I think it's your brain actually gaining more control of your body.

The sphincter that opens your urethra is actually always trying to open up, but your body sends signals through neurons to the muscles to constrict. Once you actually want to pee, you get inhibition of those neurons => the external urethral sphincter opens up => you pee

Other factors also contribute to this, such as the bladder capacity, which increases until adulthood."
AskScience,Can the Doppler effect make sounds inaudible by shifting frequencies out of human hearing range?

This assumes a surface temperature of 0 C, a temperature at the base of a uniform 50 km thick crust of 1000 C, a temperature at the base of the mantle at 2900 km depth of 3000 C, a temperature at the top of the outer core of 3700 C (to account for the jump in temp across the core-mantle boundary), a temperature at the base of the inner core at 5100 km depth of 5000 C, and an interior temperature of 7000 C with linear extrapolations between those set points and then doing a volumetric average across a set of spherical shells of 25 km differential radii. The approximate temperatures and thickness come from common sources (e.g., [this one](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/9-2-the-temperature-of-earths-interior/) or [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient)). There are a variety of problems with these assumptions (and really the temperature profile in the mantle is going to be the biggest contributor as it's such a large percentage of the Earth's volume, ~84%), but probably gets you in the right ball park.

**EDIT:** As it's coming up in comments, in reality estimating the real temperature profile is very challenging as discussed in many papers (e.g., [Deschamps & Trampert, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X04001426)) so this is, without a doubt, wrong in detail, but likely is not *that* wrong."
AskScience,Why are the extinction events in the Cambrian not considered mass extinctions?,"> There's a graph on Wikipedia (you can view it if you just type in ""extinction event"") that shows the extinction rate of marine genera over the last 550 million years or so, beginning at the Cambrian.

Always helpful to actually link to what you're talking about, i.e., [this graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Extinction_intensity.svg) that pairs with a [list of extinction events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinction_events).

>Do these extinctions have names

Yes, they are usually referred to as the [Botomian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-Botomian_mass_extinction) and [Dresbachian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresbachian) events (and they appear in the list of extinction events linked above as such).

> why aren't they counted as the major mass extinctions that they are?

They are considered mass extinctions and regularly discussed as such, e.g., they are included in lists of mass extinctions like Table 1 of [Bond & Grasby, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216306915). Presumably more what you're asking is why are they not either (1) considered part of the ""big 5"" (or maybe why isn't the ""big 5"" instead the ""big 7"" including them) or (2) why do they not represent the end of a geologic period (like the end Permian or end Cretaceous extinctions, etc.)?

The answer to these two questions reflect a couple of different things. One aspect (that is touched on in the short wiki entries for both of these events), is that the fossil record for these periods is pretty spotty so we simply don't know that much about these events compared to many others in terms of exact timing, potential causes, geographic distribution of the event, and more solid numbers on the percentages of genera that went extinct. Another important aspect is that the [geologic timescale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale), including the way it is structured and what divisions get which relative rank (i.e., is something the boundary between an era, eon, period, epoch, and so on) reflect kind of a weird mix of history (in the sense of past work) and lots of more modern work. What this means is that sometimes, major events that were recognized after the establishment of the geologic timescales basic structure might end up not being a major division in the timescale. While there is a lot of effort to better establish the absolute ages of the various boundaries using radiometric dating, there is a general resistance to wholesale change the divisions (in terms of say elevating something like an epoch boundary to a period boundary) because it makes dealing with previous work a real pain.

The two issues described above are also related in that given the relative lack of details known about these two extinction events (and especially their imprecise timing), *they don't make good major divisions for the geologic timescale*. What makes the timescale useful in part is that the hierarchy of divisions reflect (in a simple way) both the actual scale of changes that occur across that boundary, but also critically how easily it is *globally* recognize those changes within the geologic record (and where at the ""lesser"" parts of the timescales divisions like stages, end up being regional so it's pretty common to have different stages for different continents)."
AskScience,"Why are green and red laser pointers so cheap and available, but yellow ones not so much?",Infrared and red laser pointers are direct laser diodes  (put current in and light squirts out).  Green and blue laser pointers are made by using an infrared laser diode to pump a nonlinear optical crystal which doubles the frequency (halves the wavelength... however you want to say it) to put out photons with a new color.  That doubling leaves a gap of wavelengths that are more difficult to access.
AskScience,Are there hormonal stages other than puberty and menopause?,"The first three measurable, developmental, hormonal stages in humans occur in the womb, in infants between 6 and 24 months and then at puberty. Activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis drives all three. That is the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and gonads all activate and start emitting hormones in concert to co-ordinate development and [sex] differentiation. 

The first happens in the womb and is essential for early sex differentiation before birth. After birth, between 6 and 24 months, there is a period of mini-puberty. In boys this lasts at the shorter end and in girls for the full 2 years. Mini-puberty is essential for male genital development but it also plays an important role in setting infant growth rates, developing cognitive function and initiating early language and speech processes. The third HPG activation, which we're all most familiar with, is puberty which sets the secondary sexual characteristics and has a marked role in influencing cognitive function through to the one's early 20s

AskScience,"Does having autoimmune disorder (atopic disease in my mind, but also otherwise) lead to an increased risk of immune cell cancer?","In theory, yes increased turnover/expansion of immune cells in inflammatory contexts can lead to increased frequency of oncogenic mutations that turn into hematological cancers. Each round of cell division has the possibility to introduce oncogenic mutations (mutations in genes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one) as a result of DNA replication errors. But there are also many mechanisms to correct such errors or kill off cells with oncogenic mutations. So the chance of cancers arising solely from this mechanism are low and there are a number of other factors that play more substantial roles in cancer formation.

The conditions you listed are associated with chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been widely established as a risk factor for many different cancers. While increased cell turnover (e.g. immune cells in inflammatory settings) can potentially enhance the risk of oncogenic mutations,  the inflammatory microenvironment (i.e. both cellular composition and factors secreted by theses cells in inflamed tissue) itself is likely a much more substantial driver of cancer formation. For example, remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ie the scaffold that forms tissue structure) is an important feature of inflammation but is also critical for metastasis and/or formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) that could feed a growing tumor. Immune cells in inflamed tissue can secrete MMPs (which break down and remodel the extracellular matrix) and angiogenic factors. While the immune system/inflammation is essential to kill cancerous cells in tumors, some subsets of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment (TME) secrete factors that suppress the anti-cancer immune response. Chronic inflammation can enhance or induce these suppressor subsets. [Here's a nice review on the mechanisms by which inflammation drives cancer formation.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107476131930295X)

For your question specifically, there is a JAMA [paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2767601) that reports an association between atopic eczema and lymphoma risk. It's not a particularly strong association, but they did find that the lymphoma risk correlates with eczema severity. Given that the potency of the inflammatory response determines severity, this is in line with what I mentioned above. In theory, controlling inflammation (which is the principle behind most eczema therapies) should reduce the cancer risk. But broad immune suppression increases the risk of infection. Infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV-one of the causative agents of mononucleosis) is a [well-recognized risk factor of development of both Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/path.4459). EBV infects lymphocytes and encodes proteins that contribute to cancer cell transformation and augment the TME to make it more suppressive. Other viruses have also been associated with this before.  EBV driven lymphomas are a potential complication in transplant patients (which receive potent immunosuppressant drugs to increase transplant success).

So overall, yes chronic inflammatory diseases like eczema or asthma can potentially promote cancer but  not  (solely)  through the mechanism you describe. I hope I've been able to help your prospective study (which I think you should definitely write, its a really neat hypothesis)!"

AskScience,How close is our solar system to 'the edge' of the galaxy?,"Around 90% of the Milky Way's stars lie closer to the galactic center than ours does,^1 so in that sense, we are pretty far out.

In distance, not so much. The galactic disk does not have a well defined extent, but its main component (the ""thin disk"") is well approximated as having a scale length around 3 kpc (10 000 light years) and a scale height around 0.3 kpc (1000 light years).^2 That means if you travel outward 10 000 light years, or ""up/down"" 1000 light years, the density of stars drops a factor of about 1/e ~ 37%.

The Sun lies close to the disk's plane around 8 kpc (25 000 light years) from the galactic center. If we take the disk's edge to be where the density of stars is about 10% what it is here, then it lies about 2000 light years ""up/down"" (twice the scale height) or about 20 000 light years outward (twice the scale length). By this definition, we are a little over halfway out from the center of the galaxy.

However, the galaxy also includes a diffuse stellar halo, which is spheroidal and extends *far* beyond the disk, out to at least 100 kpc (300 000 light years) from the galactic center.^3 We are under 10% of the distance to the edge of the stellar halo.

Also, if you include the galaxy's dark matter halo, it extends out to over 200 kpc (700 000 light years) from the galactic center. This is the best ""hard line"" edge of the galaxy, since any star within the dark matter halo could be reasonably interpreted as being part of the galaxy's stellar halo. But even then, there are several different definitions for the edge of a dark matter halo.

AskScience,How are the increased amount of wildfires we’ve seen over the last couple of years directly related to climate change?,"Lack of rain is part of the issue, but as usual, it's a complex situation with multiple contributing factors.

The first one, at least the one I was aware of the earliest, was the spread of invasive species such as pine beetle, spruce beetle and a few others. When warmer climates allowed them to spread to new areas, they were able to outpace their natural predators and devastate large forested areas.

This was not necessarily a death sentence, but the most affected areas were areas where the forestry industry had razed biodiversity, and re-planted only specific kinds of trees (usually one species in a very large area). This unnatural configuration made them all compete for the same limited nutrients, weakening the top soil and making the trees unhealthy.

Unhealthy trees are an easy target for tree-killing insects. Dead trees are basically kindling. A lack of moisture in the trees, combined with a lack of moisture in the environment, combined with the lack of other vegetation or healthy topsoil providing any sort of safety net, turns what was once a healthy, diverse forest into a Tinderbox.

The danger is amplified as temperatures continue to rise, because the trees get even drier, and the chance of a small spark setting off a massive blaze increases.

I'm sure I've missed some significant factors, as wildfires were a thing before the invasive species showed up, but the increased frequency and severity is at least partially due to what I've outlined above.

Someone with more info will hopefully elaborate further and point out anything I've got wrong, here. :)

Edit: u/link_hiker has raised an interesting study by NASA that found pine beetle kill and wildfire spread are not positively correlated in all cases.

More recent study seems to indicate the type of forest and regional factors can actually make pine beetle kill areas less likely to burn.

However, other data suggests pine beetle kill areas, when they do ignite, burn much faster than healthy trees.

AskScience,"At the cellular level, what is the cause of endothelial dysfunction as we age?","Many many things. some include: Cellular senescence, atherosclerosis/calcifications (physical narrowing that won't improve with nitric oxide around), autonomic changes with age changing basal tone, shear stress (narrower vessels causing higher velocity flow which damages endothelium more easily), exposure to medications which might change vessel characteristics (eg chemotherapy wreaks havoc on blood vessels)."
AskScience,"If the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is growing by 2.5cm per year in an east-west direction, are we losing earth somewhere else?","Yes, at [subduction zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction). Broadly speaking and at a global scale, any total increase in plate sizes from creation of sea floor at mid-ocean ridges will be balanced by subduction of sea floor *somewhere* else. 

One thing to clarify is that this doesn't imply that spreading is perfectly balanced by subduction of the *same* plate or adjacent to the *same* plate. While, it's certainly possible to have a plate that is effectively maintaining a constant surface area with paired equal subduction and half-spreading rates on opposite sides, it's not required (and not even necessarily common). Take the [North American Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate) for example. It broadly has spreading on the east side (i.e., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and subduction on the west side, but in most places it is the overriding plate (i.e., a plate, mostly the Pacific plate, is subducitng underneath it) meaning that the North American plate is broadly getting larger at the moment. To some extent, the western half of spreading of the Mid-Atlantic is balanced by subduction of the Pacific plate beneath, but it does not need to sum to zero on the basis of just these two plates^(1). What is required (in the sense of conservation of mass) is that spreading/extension in aggregate is balanced by subduction/underthrusting in aggregate across the whole surface of the planet. 

The above also isn't just an assumption. We can measure plate velocities with techniques like GPS and show that we if consider chains of relative velocities, i.e., *plate circuits* (e.g., velocity of plate A with respect to B, plate C with respect to B, plate D with respect to C, plate E with respect to D, and plate A with respect to E), the velocities sum to zero within error. This is consistent with the idea that spreading is balanced *on average* with subduction (and that the planet is neither increasing or decreasing in volume / surface area).

*^(1)And it broadly does not. If we use a [plate motion calculator](https://www.unavco.org/software/geodetic-utilities/plate-motion-calculator/plate-motion-calculator.html) to calculate the relative velocity of a spot in the middle of the North American plate (40N, 100W) with respect to the Pacific plate, we get that North America is moving 17.7 mm/yr east and 23.3 mm/yr south (or 29.2 mm/yr at an azimuth of 142) with respect to the Pacific plate. If calculate the relative velocity of that same spot with respect to the Eurasian plate, we get that North America is moving 22.4 mm/yr west and 5.5 mm/yr south (or 23 mm/yr at an azimuth of 256) with respect to Eurasia. While overly simplified (especially since plate motions are really rotations, and comparing linear velocities at a point, like we're doing is ignoring this), this gets the point across that spreading at the Mid-Atlantic is not perfectly balanced by subduction of the Pacific, i.e., the relative velocities are not equal. Or alternatively, we can look at [estimates of absolute plate motions](http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ftp/maps/plate_tectonics_simple.morvel.sa.1.pdf), i.e., the rate and directions of plate motions relative a similar non-moving reference. In this view, it's easy to see that the sum of Pacific - North America - Eurasia plate motion does not equal zero. Per the above though, if we summed all of the velocities of all of the plates, they would equal approximately zero.*"
AskScience,Extinction of the Dinosaurs: What did I miss?,"I don't know much about why they thought the peninsula formed. The current crater from the chixulub impact is half under the land and half under the sea, and does not seem to follow the coastline as it is today. 

Mostly what convinced people was the timing and size. Before the Alvarez team (father and son) found the iridium in the KT boundary, there wasn't any evidence that there was a meteoric strike at the right time of the right size.  After they found the iridium, they looked for other records from mining/gas companies, as people wanted the smoking gun .. the crater itself. 

They calculated how big a bolide would be needed to coat the earth in such a way with this amount of iridium and then calculated the size of the crater, as well as the age.  

The crater had actually been known for a while but the company that did the surveys wasn't keen on sharing their info due to competition concerns (not specifically about the crater iirc)

Finally once the crater was found, dated and confirmed it was accepted more or less.  Better climate modelling showing the extent of the conditions also helped the case 

Many think it wasn't the ONLY factor though. But a contributing one.  The last straw that broke the camels back so to speak. 

For instance the Deccan traps in India is the remains of a massive flood basalt that occured around the same time and likely contributed to the situation with the bolide (some claim the impact caused the volcanic eruption, the shock waves converging on the far side of the planet where India would have been at the time. But less evidence for that)."
AskScience,"During the last ice age, how long would it have taken for the ice sheets to form?","I was briefly a Geology Major long ago so some info may not be up to date. 

1a. A quick look at that last glacial maximum shows time frames on 10’s of thousands of years. So the ice would be accumulating for around ~10-15 thousand years then declining to where we see it today possibly. 

1b. Sounds about right. The “warm season” is not sufficient to erase the previous winters snow fall. A lot of these cycles seem to work on positive feedback loops. More ice > more light reflected back to space > colder weather > more ice etc. the condition will accelerate its effects until another factor steps in like natural variation in the earths tilt and orbit, or volcanic activity etc. which may cause a warming cycle to begin causing the ice age to diminish. Technically I believe we are still in an Ice Age as we have ice caps where as in the distant past earth did not have such caps year round possibly. 

1c. Less significant variations than you may see today across the globe seems to most plausible. 

2. Weirdly most glaciation happens on land and land is mostly in the Northern Hemispheres. The glaciation would of had effects globally. Lowered sea levels had caused England to have more landmass and possibly even connected Australia to New Zealand by a land bridge now submerged. They would of had a wildly different ecosystem than they have now would be my guess. But they may be the reason they have such unique animals today.

AskScience,Just how dark is deep space?,"I believe It all comes down to the angle of light hitting it and being reflected to your eye, and the amount of light that is being reflected really.

In sci-fi, we'll see a spacecraft in detail because that's what the audience is expecting but, more than likely, in deep space with a vast amount of distance to the nearest star you probably wouldn't be seeing much. 

However, the same goes for a moon-sized spaceship that is sitting in the earth's shadow in our own solar system. If there's little/no light hitting it that is reflected to your eye then it's effectively invisible to us. 

The point being, while all objects do emit light (usually in the infrared; Google black body radiation) it becomes increasingly difficult to see reflected light from a small source point, onto a small object, that you are well distanced from. Maybe if you plan on venturing into deep space you should bring a floodlight or two?"
AskScience,"When humans next land on the moon, will our telescopes from Earth's surface be able to photograph the rocket on the moon's surface?","Maybe just *barely*!

The maximum possible resolution you can physically get depends on the size of the telescope. The next generation of ground-based optical telescopes will have mirrors around 30m in size. At the distance of the Moon, these could have a resolution of about 5 or 10 metres, if they have perfect optics. So you might be able to make out the lander as a fuzzy blob at the limit of resolution, but won't be able to see any astronauts, and definitely not any footprints. You'd really want something like a 200m telescope if you wanted down to 1 metre resolution.

Interferometry isn't the best thing to help here. While you can combine light from multiple telescopes separated by some distance to increase their resolution, this is really tricky to do with visible wavelengths, and you're limited to a small number of telescopes on the same site. What you end up with isn't quite an *image* as you don't have enough combinations of baselines between telescopes to get the full visual information. At lower wavelengths (e.g. radio) it becomes easier to do interferometry affordably with a large number of telescopes (possibly even spread over the world!), but longer wavelengths also inherently have a lower resolution, and you're often dealing with a much dimmer image - the Sun emits a lot of visible light, so most things in the solar system are brightest in the visible ranges.

Overall, to photograph the Moon (and many other solar system objects) you get much better resolution by sending a small telescope to orbit the Moon than building a big one on Earth."
AskScience,Does the spinning of a bullet have any effect on its drag?,"Seeing as though nobody is really answering your question I'll take a swing at things. As a disclaimer, while I am a student of physics, my specialty is optics and not fluid dynamics.

From the Wikipedia page on drag coefficients, it looks like the total drag coefficient (C_d) is defined as the sum of pressure drag (C_p) and friction drag (C_f). These can be thought of respectively as:

The component of drag that comes from the traditional resistive force we think of due to the fluid exerting a pressure on the face of the projectile, and a ""negative pressure"" behind the projectile. If you look at the expression to compute this, there's a dot product between the free stream flow unit vector and the negative surface element normal unit vector (inside a surface integral). What this means is for a cube in a non-turbulent fluid, only the front and back faces of the cube contribute to this C_p term. By thinking about the symmetry, a spinning bullet should have no effect here.

The component of drag that comes from a shear stress due to fluid friction along the sides of the projectile. Again in this surface integral there's a dot product, this time between the shear stress unit vector and and the free stream flow unit vector. This is then scaled by multiplying it by the total shear stress at the differential surface element. For a spinning projectile, this total shear stress value is larger than if it was not spinning, so by this reasoning a spinning bullet should experience more drag than a stable, non rotating bullet.

Now I suppose this is all for a very idealized scenario. However a quick search for literature on friction drag simulations turned up this paper https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijae/2020/6043721/ which seems to suggest that the spinning effect does indeed have some small contribution to the total drag, although it gets becomes less important at higher speeds (below Mach 1).

TL;DR: Yes it appears a bullet does incur a little bit of extra drag from it spinning, however it's necessary to stabilize the bullet and is fairly negligible when the projectile speed is high."

AskScience,What is the physics behind why MRI scans take as long as they do?,"Radiographs are near instantaneous because the photons all hit the digital detector simultaneously and the detector can be read at electronic speeds, i.e, very fast. There is only a no little post-processing.

In modern CT, the x-ray photons hit the detectors instantaneously and continuously but the patient must be moved through the beam for some distance. This takes time. There is then significant post-processing to generate the various image sets.

In MRI imaging, first, the magnet is always ON. A smaller set of magnets is used to 'tune' a slice of the body to a particular frequency. The body is then pulsed with radio frequency energy at a ""resonant"" frequency to tilt the protons out of alignment. The scanner must then listen for the echoes of this pulse for a period of time then move on to the next slice. While there are tricks to this process that can speed up this process, there is a fundamental ""listening time"" that cannot be avoided. THEN there is still similar postprocess of the data that must occur."

There's inherent variation in the genome, different people will have different variants in different orders, so everyone has a unique string of nucleotides. However, that variation is not evenly distributed. There are some positions that are ""polymorphic"" (variable) where at a specific position different people have different variants, and there are positions that are ""fixed"" where virtually every person has the same letter at that position. 

When we compare two people or two individuals of the same species we compare polymorphic sites, so if you pick two random people, on average 3 million of those 3 billion nucleotides at polymorphic sites will be different from each other.

When we compare species, we compare fixed sites. Those 30,000 differences between humans and neanderthals means that there are 30,000 sites in the genome where virtually all humans have one nucleotide, and virtually all neanderthals have a different nucleotide (eg, virtually all humans have a C while virtually all neanderthals have an A)."
AskScience,What makes it difficult to determine whether nutrient deficiencies are implicated in mental-health issues like ADHD?,"Number of inputs vs lack of ethical control scenarios + difficulty due to time basically.

If, for example, you wanted to answer this question a logical experiment might be to put a bunch of kids in a controlled setting at birth, possibly their mothers if prenatal deficiency is part of the theory, and then raise them for a couple decades with a deficiency in a specific vitamin and see if they have higher rates than the population at large.  Potentially do this a number of times to isolate different vitamins, levels of deficiency, timing and so on. 

Sound like something you would want to do?

But we can't. So we have to wait for a statistically significant number of people to get diagnosed, hope they have decent medical records and comb through those records for a common thread which stands out from all other possible environmental and genetic influences as a stronger predictor, and then do further analysis to make sure it remains predictive. Maybe start testing a large population in a longitudinal study to see if people with that behavior, deficiency, whatever eventually get diagnosed. Of course, if it IS a vitamin deficiency that wasnt previously tested you have to wrestle with the ethics of whether to address the deficiency or let it go and see what happen when you find it. 


Tldr; Anything around brain development and mental health has an astronomical number of variables and few if any ethical ways to create a controlled experiment to start isolating them. Because development takes a couple of decades at least the sheer time and effort involved is also a significant barrier. So instead these studies are often meta-analysis of scattered and inconsistent data generated from other studies."
AskScience,How do scientists know the racoon dog was the most likely vector for the COVID-19 zoonotic transfer to humans?,"A very early genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was posted by Chinese researchers, then removed (probably because of Chinese government pressure). However, a few western researchers grabbed the sequence before it was removed and analyzed it. As well as viral sequence, the sample had raccoon dog DNA sequences associated with it (as contaminants), implying that this extremely early virus sample came from raccoon dogs. It’s known that raccoon dogs were kept in the wet market that’s been implicated in very early COVID19 transmission, and raccoon dogs are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, so it’s a consistent story. 

It’s unfortunate that the Chinese government are obviously trying to suppress this, because if they’d simply make available the info about this there would be less space for the silly conspiracy theories.

Here’s the WHO statement, which explains a little more and shows the level of frustration they have with the Chinese government: [SAGO statement on newly released SARS-CoV-2 metagenomics data from China CDC on GISAID](https://www.who.int/news/item/18-03-2023-sago-statement-on-newly-released-sars-cov-2-metagenomics-data-from-china-cdc-on-gisaid)

AskScience,Can somebody give me an example of a predator and prey duo that have a very recent common ancestor?,"Fireflies are a great example. Nearly every species is poisonous to some degree. Except for those in the genus photuris. This group has lost its ability to produce poison. To compensate, the females of this genus can reproduce the light patterns of the closely related fireflies in the genus photinus. When the male photinus approaches the female photuris doing her mimic flashes, she grabs and devours the male. Her tissues then accumulate the poison the male had produced.

Thus, an otherwise non-toxic firefly genus regains its poisonous heritage by seducing and eating her genetic cousins."
AskScience,What is the reason for the varying magnetisms of different alloys of iron nickel and cobalt?,"It all comes down to the long range order of magnetic spin. Because these are alloys, it’s difficult to identify the short-range structure giving rise to the long range order. There are multiple types of magnetism. In this case the materials are likely ferrimagnetic where some amount of spin is cancelled out by nearby spin. Imagine if you had a local structure of 10 atoms with net “up-spin” of 10 if that structure is next to a local structure of 10 atoms with “down-spin” of 5, then the average magnetism would be the same as a ferromagnet with a net spin of 5 for those 20 atoms.

Because of the challenge in identifying the local structures, it is difficult to identify the reason for the trend in these alloys."
AskScience,Why do we all have different voices?,"We all have different bodies and brains. Differences in vocal cords, tongue, teeth, and lungs can affect speech, but the brain is the main part. The brain is why lots of people can do foreign accents or impressions but still have a natural speaking pattern separate from those. We pick up our unique way of speaking as children as we learn to talk. Baby babble mostly sounds the same, but by the time kids speak in full sentences they have a much more individual voice. As they grow, kids pick up expressions, vocabulary, and vocal quirks that further separates each kid from their peers."
AskScience,"Why is it that most volcanoes on Io are low relief in nature, lacking the ability to build towering mountains like most volcanoes on Earth and Mars?","There have been a variety of explanations put forward for the formation of the Patera on Io, but I don't think there's consensus yet (someone more versed in planetary geology may correct me on that). As you mention, they share some morphological similarities with caldera on Earth (and Mars, etc), but an exact analogy between calderas on Earth and patera on Io is problematic, leading some to suggest we could consider patera as a type of caldera - as opposed to being a true caldera (e.g., [Radebaugh et al., 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2000JE001406)). As discussed in that paper, one of the big problems with explaining patera as calderas is that calderas on Earth are primarily formed by collapse after explosive, dominantly felsic (high silica) magma. In contrast, it appears that most erupted products on Io are mafic to ultramafic (low silica). One option floated by Radenbaugh et al., is that one way you could get caldera like features from a mafic or ultramafic eruption is if it was very volatile rich. On earth, the extent to which an eruption is explosive or effusive is driven both by viscosity (felsic = higher viscosity, mafic = lower viscosity) and gas content (felsic = higher gas content, mafic = lower gas content), but if you had a very ""gassy"" mafic or ultramafic magma, maybe you could still generate a large explosive eruption like those that form calderas on Earth.

Radebaugh actually goes through six different options, some others including volatiles and a few suggesting that patera may be more like extensional pull aparts (i.e., a [graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graben)) filled with lava later. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that volcanism and patera on Io are genetically related to the non-volcanic mountains that also exist on Io (e.g., [Jaeger et al., 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002JE001946), [Kirchoff et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X10007132)) and Radebaugh emphasize the importance of considering the influence of tectonism on the morphology of the patera. The paper also highlights that there might not be *one* mechanism for all patera as there is a good amount of variety in their detailed morphology.

Alternatively, [Keszthelyi et al., 2004](https://zenodo.org/record/1259017/files/article.pdf) propose a model where (1) ascending magma encounters a volatile rich (specifically SO2 and sulfur) layer in the crust of Io and gets stuck cause it's not buoyant enough to rise through this volatile rich layer (i.e., the magma is more dense), (2) the magma starts to melt the overlying sulfur and SO2 rich material that flows laterally forming sills, (3) this progressively basically carves out a chasm (i.e., the patera) above the magma chamber, which itself may become exposed if melt supply is sufficient. 

**TL;DR** No single explanation exists for the formation of patera. Some explanations consider them sort of like weird versions of calderas that can form due to higher volatile content mafic magmas, others as more passive features that are extensional and get filled in by lava later, and others still that invoke more unique processes like the interaction of magma with an extremely volatile rich upper crust."

AskScience,"Depictions of atomic nuclei often show distinct and individual protons and neutrons, is this accurate?","> Is it correct to say that while in a nucleus, protons and neutrons maintain their distinct properties (size, shape, mass, etc.)?

AskScience,"I know this question might be kind of dumb but, How do they keep the space station cool?","While heat can not leave the station via conduction or convection, there is still heat loss via radiation. All objects constantly emit electromagnetic radiation depending on temperature, the hotter the object the more energy is emitted and the higher the frequency of the emitted radiation. (this is why if you heat an object to high temperatures it starts glowing red, then if you keep heating it white!)

The strips of white panels you see on the ISS that look a bit like solar panels are actually radiators which are used to keep the station cool."
AskScience,Could being submersed in a sealed tank of fluid help humans survive heavy G acceleration in outer space?,"Yes. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures as fluids are difficult to compress. Because fluids are difficult to compress, there's no appreciable change in density under high acceleration. This concept has already been applied to high G flight suits, namely the Libelle G suit, which has allowed pilots to remain conscious and functioning during maneuvers as high as 10 G's. 

The practical acceleration protection limit via liquid immersion is hypothesized to be approximately 15-20 G's. Beyond that, cavities such as your lungs will collapse, so you'd need to fill your cavities with a human compatible oxygenated immersion fluid which simultaneously has a similar density to water. There is practical upper limit as the differential density of tissues inside the human body will eventually be reached, but hypothetically, if you filled a person with this fluid in all their cavities (lungs, stomach, intestines, etc.), they could survive outrageous amounts of acceleration. Of course, this is all contingent on finding an immersion fluid which is both lung-compatible and has a density similar to water, so it'll probably never happen."
AskScience,Why do individuals with Turner's syndrome (XO sex chromosomes) not have ovaries?,"Uh hi I actually have turners syndrome. Mosaic turners to be more specific.

My left was abnormal; it was described as streaked, flat and generally not formed and was probably nonfunctional. It was removed during the c section delivery of my youngest child. My right one however works just fine. Proof for that is that I’ve conceived naturally and have two kids to show for it.

Due to my genetic make up though, having ovaries when having an xxxy chromosome make up gives me a much higher chance of developing tumors so my remaining ovary is being plucked out next week. Hope this info from someone’s personal experience helps!"
AskScience,Why do earthquakes happen in Mexico in September specifically?,"> It’s literally every year we get an earthquake in September. Like a relatively big one at that. 

It might seem like that in your memory, but this is definitely not the case, at least if we consider large earthquakes. If we look at a particular slice of time and consider the entirety of Mexico and the 37 years since the 1985 M8 earthquake (the first of the latest three September 19 earthquakes), there have been 9 >M7 earthquakes in September (e.g., [this from the USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=5.65972,-126.65039&extent=39.50404,-82.13379&range=search&timeZone=utc&search=%7B%22name%22:%22Search%20Results%22,%22params%22:%7B%22starttime%22:%221985-09-19%2000:00:00%22,%22endtime%22:%222022-09-19%2023:59:59%22,%22maxlatitude%22:32.769,%22minlatitude%22:13.846,%22maxlongitude%22:-91.055,%22minlongitude%22:-117.686,%22minmagnitude%22:7,%22orderby%22:%22time%22%7D%7D)), and several of these are likely aftershocks (i.e., if you have a large earthquake, like the M8 September 19, 1985 earthquake, something like the M7.6 September 21, 1985 earthquake is not unexpected as an [aftershock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock)). Ultimately though, for a question like this, without specifying a magnitude, it becomes really pointless, i.e., as we get down to M5 and below [there are just so many earthquakes globally](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/lists-maps-and-statistics) and even regionally for any active plate boundary, like western Mexico, that saying that there ""are always earthquakes in September"" becomes a meaningless and arbitrarily true statement for literally any month (or day at lower magnitude levels).

> And for some reason on September 19th we tend to get the 7+ magnitude ones. 

There have been three, including the 1985 earthquake. Given that at a spatial scale like this, the timing of earthquake occurrence is random, this is basically an extension of the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem), i.e., the probability of a given number of people having the same birthday in a room full of a specific number of people. You can go through the math, and depending on exactly how you approximate it (in terms of how narrow a region you consider to establish the number of earthquakes, i.e., the number of people in the room) in terms of three ""birthdays"", i.e., earthquake days, occurring on the same day, you'll get something like ~3% in terms of the probability of three earthquakes occurring on the same day in that region over a 37 year period given the number of >M7 quakes that happened. 

> What are the odds of September just being the earthquake month? 

When you get to months, you only have 12 possible choices, so given a stochastic process (like earthquakes), it's not that unlikely to get some month with more. If you go through the 23 >M7 events in the 37 year slice of the USGS catalog linked above, you'll get the following occurrences: January - 2, February - 1 , March, 1, April - 4, May - 0, June - 2, July - 0, August - 0, September - 9, October -2, November -1, and December - 0. So definitely September has close to twice as more than the next most common month (April), but again, some of that is artificial in the sense of *expecting* more in proximity to prior ones (i.e., aftershocks). If we ignore the aftershock bit, this is equivalent to asking if you rolled a 12 sided die (i.e., one side for each month) 23 times, what's the probability that you'd roll a 9, 9 times. Again, you can go through the math (or maybe some helpful Redditor will come in to do the math for us), but you'll find that it's not exactly an astronomically unlikely result. (**EDIT**: [this site](https://www.omnicalculator.com/statistics/dice#how-to-calculate-dice-roll-probability) lays out the math for this exact problem in a pretty straightforward way, as this is equivalent to rolling 23, 12 sided dice and asking what the probability that 9 of those dice will come up as 9s. If you go through the math (or use the calculator they provide) you get a probability of ~0.005%. If you recognize that 2 of the 9 earthquakes in the set of September earthquakes are very clearly aftershocks, and thus are not independent, and we recast it in terms of asking what's the probability of rolling 7 9s with 21 12 sided dice, i.e., removing our two aftershocks from consideration of both the September set and the full set, we get ~0.1% probability, so again, not like an everyday occurrence, but not exactly that improbable. Additionally, these are calculating asking for *exactly* that number of 9s, the probability is slightly greater if you relax the criteria and ask what the probability of *at least* that number of 9s).

> Why do earthquakes happen in Mexico in September specifically?

Given all of the above, the answer is they demonstrably don't only happen in September and the fact that more have occurred in September in a given time period is the type of apparent (but not meaningful) pattern we see in distributions of stochastic processes pretty regularly. We can demonstrate this if we return to our earthquake catalog and instead [go back to 1900](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=5.65972,-126.65039&extent=39.50404,-82.13379&range=search&timeZone=utc&search=%7B%22name%22:%22Search%20Results%22,%22params%22:%7B%22starttime%22:%221900-01-01%2000:00:00%22,%22endtime%22:%222022-09-19%2023:59:59%22,%22maxlatitude%22:32.769,%22minlatitude%22:13.846,%22maxlongitude%22:-91.055,%22minlongitude%22:-117.686,%22minmagnitude%22:7,%22orderby%22:%22time%22%7D%7D), instead of 1985. If we now count number of M >7 by months, we get the following, Jan - 4, Feb - 3, March - 6, April - 9, May - 3, June - 10, July - 3, August - 4, Sept - 9, Oct - 7, Nov - 3, and Dec - 6. So effectively between 1900-1985 there were *no earthquakes in September* and presumably if Reddit was around in 1985, people would be asking why do earthquakes always occur in Mexico in June. (**EDIT:** If you return to the dice example and now use the total 67 M>7 earthquakes observed, in this longer time period and ask the probability of exactly 9 occurring in September like in the manner above, the probability is now ~5% and it increases to ~10% if you ask what the probability of *at least* 9 M>7 earthquakes occurring during September within the set of 67 earthquakes).

The larger point being, interpreting temporal patterns in stochastic processes, especially when these stochastic processes are rare generally and you're interpreting a ridiculously short record compared to the relevant temporal scale of the process involved, tells you very little. In certain areas, there have been arguments that seasonal changes in loads (e.g., related to timing of the wet season or snow accumulation) can lead to seasonal variation in earthquake statistics (e.g., [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_seasons/) on this subject), but I'm aware of no such argument for events related to the Cocos subduction zone (which by far is the main generator of earthquakes in Mexico).

**TL;DR** Earthquakes only appear to preferentially happen in September in Mexico for a specific temporal period, i.e., it's an artifact of looking at incredibly short record of a fundamentally stochastic process that rarely occurs."
AskScience,Do whales ever xhoke on water when they breach and can they cough if they do choke?,"So, whale anatomy is highly specialized for their aquatic lifestyle. There are multiple valves which prevent water from getting into the lungs. Their blowholes can close up, there are valves in their trachea.

AskScience,"During digestion, does ethanol react with lipids to form esters, at a significant conversion rate?","Typically, the formation of esters is an equilibrium process able to proceed in either direction.

AskScience,how much potential energy is accrued the further a body moves away from the earth?,"Neatly this is how escape velocity is found. The kinetic energy of an object at escape velocity at sea level (or any other altitude you define escape velocity from) is equal to the amount of GPE it needs to gain to get out of the Earth's gravity well, basically to reach infinite distance at zero velocity.

Note that both KE and GPE have a mass term, which is why we talk about escape velocity which is independent of mass."
AskScience,Why are we not being constantly scalded?,"Same reason why you can flick your finger through a flame and not get scalded. Heat is just the jiggling of atoms. If part of your finger gets hit with an atom of high internal energy, the energy is quickly transferred to nearby atoms in your skin. It becomes a problem when too many high energy atoms hit an area of your skin. The energy can’t spread out to nearby atoms fast enough and reaches a point where it causes ~~atomic~~  chemical bonds to break down and your skin experiences burn trauma."
AskScience,What does Alzheimer’s actually do to the brain?,The presence of neurofibrillary tangles and beta amyloid plaques (which recently have sparked controversy). Lead to the degradation of the cortex of the brain. Dementia is the term used to describe impaired cognitive status. The severity of the disease is typically generally attributed to the amount of neurofibrillary tangles. A decrease in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is present as well. Drugs that increase this neurotransmitter help with symptomatic management but do not slow the profession of the disease.
AskScience,Why can we freeze embryos for IVF but not adult humans? What makes it possible for embryos?,"Hello! Not an expert in freezing and thawing live specimen but well practiced in freezing and thawing dead specimen while keeping organs and microstructures intact. The major concern with freezing biological matter is the formation of ice crystals. Water forms crystals and expands when frozen and can result in burst cells and organelles. To avoid this, we introduce cryoprotectants. These are basically antifreeze that diffuse into the cells and around it to avoid formation of crystals. It's very easy to diffuse these new compounds into microscopic specimen because the surface area to volume ratio is very high compared to humans. Very rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen, also known as flash freezing, also helps in avoiding formation of large crystals (slow freezing means more time for the molecules to align). So the simple answer is size. We can't introduce cryoprotectants into every part of a human being fast enough nor can we flash freeze a human body fast enough."

AskScience,It seems like we havent heard anything about carbon nanotubes for almost a decade. is there anything exciting involving those these days?,"Carbon nanotubes help us make the best concrete imaginable right now.  They provide significant increases in tensile strength which is hard to achieve in concrete.

Concrete people will tell you about how ""fiber mesh"" (macro sized fibers of steel or composites) helps concrete.

Carbon nanutubes work the same way on the nano scale.  Think about velcro.  Which will be the stronger bond: fifty × 2-inch long velcro strands hooked together, or fifty trillion × strands that are each nanometers long?

One of the coolest things to me is how many shapes they can assemble the carbon into and how it affects the performance.

There are single-walled carbon nanotubes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes of a variety of designs, partially unzipped multi-walled carbon nanotubes which I think are the coolest, it's just insane.  You look at these shapes and sure you could design them in 3D software but how the heck are they arranging carbon atoms in this manner?  Cool stuff

Downside: This is pretty much only used in the research phase, no contractor in your town is using carbon nanotubes today.  Construction is a VERY slow industry to adapt to something like this.  We will see it in this progression, if it continues:

* Research projects by Universities
* Experimental civil projects by government entities (usually highway/bridge related)
* Widespread use on civil projects
* Maybe the cost comes down
* Start to see it on commercial projects
* Maybe the cost comes down more
* Start to see it on residential projects"
AskScience,How can air have pockets of different temperatures and smells in an open space?,"Some gases and molecules in the air can displace the normal mixture of atmospheric gases.

For example, the normal mix of air in the atmosphere is approximately 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, then Argon Water Vapour, Carbon Dioxide etc.

In certain situations gases such as Hydrogen Sulphide, Methanethiol, Methane, created through decomposition and other sources, and Carbon Dioxide, can displace the Oxygen in an area, or linger in an area.

Although they are subject to Brownian motion still, the physical nature of the terrain or area, together with the mass of the gas particles, results in their lingering.

If you work in certain industries you are very aware of this and are trained to do a Confined Space Entry check with a Gas Detector to verify the presence of breathable oxygen before entering a confined space.

A confined space, to someone one not familiar with a working environment, may not be immediately obvious.

I can give some examples.

A barn or shed that has been used to store fruit, such as Apples. The Oxygen in the shed can become depleted so that it's below the 21% present normally present in air, displaced by gases such as ethylene, such that if a worker walked into the barn they could become incapacitated and suffocate.

Volcanic Springs have high concentrations of Hydrogen Sulphide.

A Barn where animals are kept may have high concentrations of Hydrogen Sulphide, Methane, and Carbon Dioxide.

The confined space may not look very confined. A gully or well for example.

There was a case many years ago when a motorway was being built in the South East of the UK. It may have been the M25. They put in some large wells and on one occasion a person going down to inspect the well fell unconscious, so two of his colleagues went down to assist. One fell unconscious at the bottom, the other started to climb back up the ladder but fell off back to the floor unconscious. A fourth person told his crew to lower him down in a rope sling and pull him up if something went wrong. He too fell unconscious and slipped out of the rope sling.

It was at this point that the Emergency Services were called however all four workmen were already dead. They'd suffocated due to there being insufficient concentration of oxygen at the bottom of the well.

The cause was due to the area being composed of chalk, and recent rain, being acidic rain, had seeped through the chalk and released high levels of Carbon Dioxide which had sat in the bottom of the well displacing the Oxygen.

These days they use fans to blow down into wells before going down, and do a confined space entry check with a gas detector."
AskScience,"Did the families of languages develop after human ancestors migrated across the world, or was there an ancient 'first' language that all the langua families descended from?","Quick Google search tells me that PIE language existed around 5500 years ago, and the oldest reconstructed language, Proto Afro Asiatic was spoken 12 -18 kya.
At that time, almost all the planet has been populated , and no doubt, thousands of languages existed already.
Keeping in mind that humans could speak at the very least from 100-150 kya, but likely much earlier, there is no way to trace the languages back that far. 
So, we will never know.
But, even apes and orcas have 'dialects', so it is entirely possible that there were no single first language. In other words, the dialects might have existed before our ancestors could be called humans, and their system of signals could be called language."

Most people with excess growth hormone will develop acromegaly after their growth plates fuse. Last I checked they haven’t figured out how to treat is medically yet.

AskScience,Why are asteroid and comet orbits so different?,"Asteroids are mostly small rocky objects from the asteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter, 5 astronomical units) to the Kuiper belt (a bit past Neptune, 30 astronomical units).  Up to these distances, they are more or less in the orbital plane of the Sun.

AskScience,"If strep A can produce necrotizing fasciitis, how come strep throat with any cuts on your mouth and tongue does not translate to it? Is it because the saliva has antibacterial qualities?","It all comes down to the where.  

You can get necrotizing fasciitis from strep throat, however, the bacteria need to make their way into the muscle fascia in sufficient numbers to colonize and reproduce.  

Most bacteria are easily killed off by the immune system if they enter the bloodstream, as the blood is one of two primary pathways for white blood cells to travel and do their thing.  First the body works to keep the infection contained, then wipes it out.  Easy to do when it is an isolated area like tonsils and throat tissues.  They keep the infection contained and then as they build in numbers and other immune responses occur, they kill off the bacteria (in a person with a healthy immune system).  

It is quite uncommon for an individual to have enough pathogenic bacteria in their bloodstream to cause infections elsewhere (a notable organism that does this, however is MRSA, and it can cause ""eruptions"" in soft tissues).  Group A strep usually requires a direct entry point into the right environment to grow and consume rapidly enough to be dangerous, such as deep cuts or punctures.  

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapid, destructive infection of the muscle fascia, something group A strep loves (especially streptococcus pyrogenes), but this is also tissue that does not have great circulation, meaning the natural immune system has a hard time getting enough resources to the area to contain it.  It is also this lack of circulation that makes it very hard for it to migrate through the bloodstream.  

I treat a lot of infections in my practice, and frequently in populations with compromised immune systems.  The incidence of blood based infection, even in this population, is quite rare, and usually requires a very significant bacterial load to overwhelm the immune system.  GAS is also readily treated by antibiotics, so if caught early, it is relatively straightforward to treat.  Most people seek care when they experience signs of systemic infection, and this is also another limiting factor."

AskScience,What is the smallest possible black hole?,"Elementary particles don't have a size in the way classical objects do, but their wave function is never perfectly localized - they have a non-zero volume in that sense (for electrons in atoms it would be the volume of their orbitals, for example). The larger the center-of-mass energy the smaller the radius of that volume can be. As you increase the energy of e.g. a collision process you can make the system ""smaller"" and the Schwarzschild radius grows. The two get to a similar length at the Planck energy (2GJ) which corresponds to the Planck mass (~20 microgram) and the corresponding Schwarzschild radius is the Planck length. It's expected that the smallest black hole is somewhere around that. These are order of magnitude estimates, the precise numbers will depend on a quantum theory of gravity which we don't have yet (at least not in a way that we would be able to calculate this).

If there are microscopic extra dimensions and if gravity extends into them then gravity could be much stronger at very small distances. This would effectively mean the Schwarzschild radius is larger and you need less energy to produce a black hole. The energy might be so low that we can reach it with accelerators, so we look for possible black hole signatures at the LHC. Nothing found so far. It's pretty much an all-or-nothing search: If you have enough energy then you expect to produce tons of them and it's obvious within weeks, so we are pretty sure the LHC energy is not enough to make black holes."

AskScience,Why are Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) stronger at night?,"There are two factors to consider in MCS lifecycle: the development of new convective cores (which occurs throughout the entire lifecycle) and the detrainment/dissipation of the anvil cloud shield.

For the development of new cores, there are major differences between convection over land and ocean. Over land, convection is typically triggered by solar heating of the surface. Although the heating rate is highest at midday, it takes time for both CAPE (convective available potential energy) to increase and CIN (convective inhibition: low-level stability that prevents convection initiating) to decrease, and so typically over land you see a peak of convective activity in the afternoon/early evening (around 3-6pm local time). Over ocean, the process is driven much more by longwave cooling of the upper atmosphere. This is highest during the nighttime, but convective activity is generally more spread out across the diurnal cycle.

 Local effects are also important. As you move further towards the poles over land, solar heating becomes weaker and so convection tends to occur later during the day. You can also get a larger contribution from longwave cooling, which leads to some interesting situation such as over the Northern Great Plains of North America where there is a double peak of convective activity, once in the early evening and then again around midnight.

How convection triggers is also very important in this regard. For isolated convection, triggering mainly occurs due to heating of the surface. For organised convection, including MCSs, we also see triggering of new convective cores due to the cold outflow lifting warm air above the level of free convection. As MCS involve the convergence of warm, moist air over vast areas, this can lead to more triggering of new convection later in the day and into the night using CAPE produced during the day time, whereas the lack of solar heating would prevent convective initiation for isolated cases.

So for convective cores (over land), despite the heating occurring during the daytime, we expect the convective activity to trigger in the afternoon and early evening and continue into the night-time, particularly for cases of organised convection. We also need to consider the other component of the MCS: the anvil cloud or ""cloud-shield"" and how it is affected by the diurnal cycle.

The cloud-shield of an MCS is formed when the anvil clouds of multiple cores combine into one, and it is generally this that we see from satellite imagery, not the cores themselves. The lifecycle of the cloud shield is also linked to the diurnal cycle.

The size and lifetime of an anvil cloud is determined both by the amount of convective mass flux into it (i.e. the core convective activity) and the detrainment and dissipation of the anvil cloud at the edge. The latter is strongly driven by circulations within the cloud, which in turn is driven by the difference in radiative heating between the cloud top and cloud base.

At the cloud base, the cloud is heated by radiation absorbed from the atmosphere below, and at the cloud top it is heated by absorbed solar radiation and cooled by longwave emission. Despite the solar heating during the daytime, this difference in heating is actually stronger due to the greater heating from below compared to at night (see e.g. figure 7 in [https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JD033107](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JD033107) ). As a result, anvils tend to dissipate more rapidly during the daytime than during the nighttime. It should be noted that the cloud shields of MCSs tend to be thicker than the anvils of isolated convection, so this radiatively driven dissipation is particularly important. 

Combining these two together we can get a picture of the overall MCS lifecycle (over land): Initial convective activity occurs in the later afternoon due to solar heating building up CAPE and removing CIN during the daytime. The outflow from this convection triggers more convective cores throughout the evening and into the nighttime, and the anvils of these cores combine to create a large, thick cloud shield which matures during the nighttime. As new convective activity reduces through the night and into the early morning the MCS cloud shield starts to dissipate, but only slowly at first. As we move into the daytime, the rate of dissipation speeds up and the cloud shield reduces in size until new convective activity in the afternoon reinvigorates it and starts the process again.

Over time, the MCS anvil tends to become warmer and lower in height as the upper troposphere is warmed and stabilised. This reduces convective activity and increases anvil dissipation until eventually the MCS dissipates.

Note that this is a fairly simple view of things, primarily over land (where the diurnal cycle of convection is much stronger), and ignores interactions with synoptic scale dynamics such as Rossby waves and African Easterly waves which are both strong drivers of MCSs.

Understanding the lifecycle of complex, organised convective systems including MCSs is a fairly important area of research right now. Past studies of MCS behaviour were limited due to the observations/models which could capture the entire MCS (such as geostationary satellite imagery and global climate models) could not be used to study the convective cores, and studies of convective cores (using e.g. cloud radar and LES models) typically could not resolved the entire extent and lifecycle of MCSs. New data, such as the modern generation of geostationary weather satellites, new satellite missions such as Earthcare, INCUS and AOS and the global, kilometer scale convective resolving climate models look set to allow much more insight into thee processes, so there's a lot of exciting research going on right now. It has even been suggested (perhaps optimistically) that this is the decade of convection!

If you'd like to learn more about MCS behaviour, there are a number of recent papers on observing MCS lifecycles by Zhe Feng, Rémy Roca, Thomas Fiolleau and Kelly Núñez Ocasio.

Dennis Hartmann's group has also been producing a lot of interesting research on anvil cloud lifetimes. I would recommend checking out his recent papers with Adam Sokol and Blaž Gasparini.

For a more general overview of cloud behaviour, I recommend Cloud Dynamics by Robert Houze Jr, it's an excellent textbook on everything to do with clouds, and has a couple of sections on deep convection and MCSs. Storm and Cloud dynamics, by William Cotton, George Bryan and Sue van den Heever is also an excellent reference text.

Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to expand upon, this is the area I'm currently researching and there's a lot of interesting new work going on!"

AskScience,"When something is bent (a metal ruler for example) and returns to its original shape, what is happening on the molecular level? Where is the information of the original shape stored and what forces do the unbending?","Ah, a chance to put my material science classes to use!  

When you bend something (and a metal ruler is a great example) and it can spring back, we call that ""elastic deformation"".  

On an atomic level, metal is made of atoms in a crystal lattice. Each atom is spaced a certain distance away from its neighbors. The atoms stay at that particular distance because electromagnetic forces from their electrons and their protons add up in such a way that *that* distance is a low-energy configuration, like a ball sitting at the bottom of a dip in the ground. You can push and pull the atoms closer or farther apart, but to do that you have to put energy in, and they'll ""want"" to go back to that optimal distance.  

Next, consider the shape of the ruler. Obviously, when it's straight, both sides are the same length. But, you can bend the ruler into a curve. When you do this, *the two sides aren't the same length any more*. The outer side of the ruler is now *longer* than the shorter side. It's the same principle as taking a corner in a car; the wheels on the outside have to go farther.  

If you've stayed within the limits of elastic deformation, what's happened at the atomic level is that on the outside, you've pulled the atoms farther apart. The same crystal lattice structure is still there, but the atoms are now spaced farther apart than the lowest energy positions. On the inside, the opposite has happened: the metal is compressed, and the atoms are closer together than the lowest energy distances.  

When you release the ruler, the atoms go back to their optimal distances. The long side shrinks and the short side expands.  

So, the information of the original shape is stored in the crystal lattice structure. As long as you don't disrupt the lattice structure, the atoms ""want"" to go back to their original places. The forces that do the unbending are electromagnetism. (realistically, the only two forces you'll ever experience directly in your life are gravity and electromagnetism. If you are directly experiencing the effects of the nuclear forces, you're having a very bad day.)"
AskScience,How were free neutrons first created en mass?,"The ""Urchin"" neutron initiator used Polonium-210 and Beryllium-9.  The Polonium-210 emits an alpha particle which interacts with the Beryllium-9 to spit out a neutron.  For safety, the Po and Be were stored separately, and heavily shielded.  They are added to the bomb at the last moment, and kept separated and shielded inside the bomb until the bomb detonates.

U-235 and Pu-239 will produce neutrons basically spontaneously once you get a critical mass.  The trick is getting it to happen in a controlled fashion.  So part of the Urchin initiator was the explosive compression of the bomb's core until it reaches supercriticality.  The explosion also mixes the Polonium and Beryllium at the center, which floods the compressed fissile material with neutrons right when it becomes supercritical, allowing the chain reaction to occur everywhere in the core at once.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulated_neutron_initiator"
AskScience,Why does the mushroom cloud of atomic bombs only shoot straight up and not in all directions (like a sphere)?,"It does expand spherically initially.  The size of the explosion is determined by the size of the device/amount of nuclear material, of course.  Once energy is expanded/the chain reaction stops, the cloud moves upward due to convection; the extremely hot air of the explosion is much warmer than the air above it.  Therefore, it is more buoyant than the air above it and rises, like when you hold a beach ball or something under water. As it rises, colder air from above rushes down to fill the area left behind by the hot air.  So the cloud rises upward, leaving mainly clear air below it."

AskScience,How does aluminum increase the immune response to many vaccines?,"In general, adjuvants work by mimicking general features of pathogens. The immune system registers these features and concludes that it's being attacked by something dangerous, and mobilizes and activates itself in the region; as a result, the immune response to the antigen that's delivered along with the adjuvant is heightened, leading to more antibodies, T cells, etc. 

The immune system has a large number of receptors that recognize these [pathogen-associated molecular patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen-associated_molecular_pattern), known as ""[pattern recognition receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_receptor)"". It's believed that aluminum salts activate one of those PRRs called the [NLRP3 inflammasome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLRP3).  NLRP3 responds to a number of pathogens, as well as AlOH, but the precise mechanism by which it responds to pathogens and AlOH isn't completely clear yet. It's hypothesized that it's related to the particulate structure of aluminum salts, which might mimic some pathogens in the cell.

>Here we show that in human and mice macrophages, alum-induced IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 secretion is mediated by the NLR protein NLRP3 and its adaptor ASC, but not by NLRC4. Other particulate adjuvants, such as QuilA and chitosan, induce inflammasome activation in a NLRP3-dependent fashion, suggesting that activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome may be a common mechanism of action of particulate adjuvants....Our results demonstrate for the first time a role for the NLRP3-inflammasome during development of the immune response elicited by alum-enhanced vaccination.

--[Inflammasome activation by Alum and Alum’s adjuvant effect are mediated by NLRP3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2587213/)

Of course this wasn't known when aluminum salts were first used as adjuvants. Adjuvants (like most things vaccine-related) were empirical, not theoretical -- it was *observed* that they were safe and effective, not *theorized*.  It was well after they were in wide use that the theoretical explanation for adjuvants was [presented by Charlie Janeway](http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/54/1). Now there's a theoretical basis for developing new adjuvants, but to a large extent the tremendous and well-documented safety profile of the older adjuvants has left them in use."
AskScience,"Since we have Long Covid, do we also have ""Long Flu""?","yes, the most common postviral complication of any infection is ME/CFS aka ""Chronic Fatigue Syndrome"". The rates of conversion are similar to long covid (if you subtract LC cases of vascular and lung damage etc). ME/CFS patients have a broken Krebs (aka citric acid) cycle, and switch inappropriately to anaerobic respiration after a very short period of exertion, suffering a delayed period of symptom exacerbation (flu-like symptoms, paradoxical insomnia, brain fog, chronic pain, the list is very long) called Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) or Post -Exertional Symptom Exacerbation (PESE). For many years, these patients have been treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise, and this has been dangerous, because exercise makes these patients much worse.

Patients with ME/CFS and their advocate organizations have been trying to spread this information since the start of the pandemic, in the hopes that people would take avoiding infection more seriously, and that more research money would be dedicated to investigating diagnosis methods and treatment, because there is currently no easily testable biomarker for ME/CFS (though there are some exciting new candidates in the research pipeline) and no cure. There are some partially effective treatments for symptoms. Recovery is extremely rare and usually occurs within the first two years after infection. most patients still sick after two years will never improve. Severe patients are often bedbound, avoid all stimulation of the senses, and have a lower quality of life score than with many cancers or AIDS."

AskScience,"What happens to forgotten memories in your brain chemically and energetically, or however?","Memories are believed to be ""recorded"" as distributed synaptic changes in cerebral cortex neurons, and some aspects of this are understood (e.g., dendritic changes, post-synaptic densities, pre-synaptic modifications), very little is know about how these many changes are encoded as memories or how they are later recalled as memories or modified behavior.

That would explain why some people with advanced degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's start to recall old memories even while they're forgetting more recent ones."
AskScience,What makes a strong immune system?,"The most outward symptoms of being sick are induced by your own immune system. Fevers, chills, congestion, body aches, etc, are triggered when your immune system reacts to an infection. People who “don’t get sick often” usually just have a weaker response to infection. People who do get sick often (myself included) have immune systems that tend to overreact. A “good”, or preferable, immune system is one that doesn’t overreact to minor illness. That is, if your body is infected with a common cold virus, a healthy immune system can eliminate the virus without causing congestion and fevers. 

A good case study for this is the original H1N1 flu that killed young adults more than people who are generally more susceptible to illness. Their healthy immune systems reacted too strongly (something called a “cytokine storm”), that the response was far more lethal than the virus itself."

AskScience,How is it possible for a particular coastal area to flood when other coastal areas of the same ocean don’t?,"The elevation of coastal formations are not uniform throughout the world so it stands to reason that even without things like water currents or the tide, some coasts may be lower in elevation and more prone to flooding while higher ones are not. Furthermore, natural barriers such as mangrove trees would weaken waves and help protect the coast from things like erosion, storms, and tsunamis."
AskScience,Why did COVID go from variants to sub-variants?,"What you’re asking is why, at first, the new variants arose from the same starting point, while now the new variants are arising from each other. In other words they started off by going 

* A  -> B 
* A  -> C
* A  -> D

whereas now they are going

* D -> E -> F -> G

In these scenarios, B, C, and D would be what you’re calling “variants”, and E, F, and G are “subvariants”. (This is greatly simplified, of course.). 

The big picture answer is that those are the best-adapted viruses. As to why the best adaptations happened this particular way, it’s partly speculation, but it’s probably because the unusual nature of omicron gives it *and its variants* a transmission advantage over the other paths that could be followed. 

Omicron almost certainly arose in an immunocompromised person - perhaps someone with partially controlled HIV, for example. The person had antibodies against the infecting virus, but wasn’t able to completely eliminate the infection (perhaps because they didn’t have enough active T cells). That gives the infecting virus a very strong selection for avoiding antibodies, so it accumulates a whole range of mutations.  

What’s more, this virus arose in an increasingly immune world - not so much because of vaccination (it arose in an almost non-vaccinated population) but because of prior infection. That gave omicron an enormous transmission advantage over all the previous variants, that didn’t have as many mutations and were less able to deal with population immunity. 

(As a side note, since vaccination gives better immunity than infection, the rise of omicron could possibly have been prevented if vaccine companies and developed countries had overcome their greed and selfishness and lived up to the agreements they’d made to deliver vaccines to the whole world.)

Now, new mutations arising in omicron family members are able to build on the backbone that each previous mutation has accumulated. This is the pattern we see with influenza, for example - a series of accumulating mutations, finally culminating in one variant that has a distinct transmission advantage over the others that takes over and then itself starts to accumulate new mutations."
AskScience,Why does the ocean floor sharply drop off?,"So what you're describing is the *continental slope*, which is the steep section oceanward of the *shelf break* between the *continental shelf* (the very gentle part near shore) and the *continental rise* (the slightly steep part sloping into the deeper ocean floor, or abyssal plain), e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#/media/File:Bathmetry.png). This type of bathymetry is what we see along [passive margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin), where there is a transition between [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust) and [oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust) that reflects the site of a former continental [rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift). Continental crust is less dense and thicker than oceanic crust so the average surface elevation of the former is higher than the latter (and also why we have continents and ocean basins in the first place). 

The continental shelf part of a passive margin is a flooded portion of the continental crust and the continental rise is oceanic crust, with the continental slope largely being a transition between the two types of crust. In terms of its bathymetry, the continental slope is steep largely because the transition between these two crust type is abrupt, represented by a relatively thin zone of *transitional crust* that you see in the diagram. As the name implies, transitional crust has a density and thickness between oceanic and continental crust and it's a product of the [original rifting process that split the former continent and started to form oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#/media/File:Formation_of_passive_margins.png). 

Many of these margins will be partially capped in some amount of sediment shed off the adjacent continent (which you can see in the [diagram of a passive margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#/media/File:Passive_Contiental_Margin.jpg)), but these sediments tend to at least in part mirror that same abrupt transition because they effectively tend to be stacks of thin drapes of sediments. As an example, imagine draping a sets of thin sheets of cloth over the edge of a stair-step, the surface of the stack of cloth sheets will be end up a slightly smoothed form of the same underlying shape but with the location of the ""hinge"" a bit offset from the location of the hinge in the underlying stair-step (i.e., the transition in crust types in the real passive margin). Thus, some of the shape of a stereotypical passive margin is controlled by the geometry of the sediment packages that drape it (e.g., [this diagram](https://web.viu.ca/earle/geol201/passive-margin.gif)). Finally, it's worth noting the above is describing what we call a non-volcanic (or magma-poor) rifted margin, which is the most common type of passive margin, but there are other types which result in different bathymetries. For example, [volcanic rifted margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#Volcanic_rifted_margin), as the name implies, instead tend to have the transition from continental to oceanic crust draped in a large volume of volcanic rocks, which still results in a similar shape, but where the continental shelf is usually narrower and the continental slope is steeper (e.g., the eastern margin of Brazil or Australia)."

AskScience,could an approach of targeting CCR5 receptors to inactive/destroy it be used to gain HIV immunity?,"So CCR5 is an essential coreceptor for HIV viral entry to the cell, and yes removing it would complicate a virus to enter and induce pathogenesis affiliated with HIV.

Just know the role of ccr5 is not limited to HIV receptor entry, as it participates in a number of GPCR signaling pathways related to granulocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as a healthy pro inflammatory process in general terms.

AskScience,How does the rabies virus actually compel the host to bite? How does it know how to tell the brain to bite another living thing?,"I don't know about specific viruses, but regarding evolution:

Nothing really ""wants"" to do anything or ""knows how to"" do anything in this way. It's a simple way of explaining it, that's all.

Before this trait evolved in rabies, let's say, it didn't compel hosts to bite other animals.

Eventually one strain of rabies had a random mutation that made the host more aggressive, or maybe salivate more - something that would cause it to bite or attack.

This particular strain spread really well, because that's a good advantage. This ""biting"" strain is now the dominant strain - most rabies strains make hosts bite other animals...

So, the virus doesn't *want* to do anything. It's just the most successful ""breed"" of virus, so it survived.

A lot of mutations are negative - they usually die out.

This water is not used to drive the steam turbine directly. It goes through a heat exchanger to heat a secondary loop of water to create steam for the turbine. The steam needs to be condensed back to water in order to be reused. Some reactors use bodies of water, some use cooling towers. The steam coming out of cooling towers is considerably colder at less than 50C and at atmospheric pressure."
AskScience,Why didn't heavier atoms originate in the Big Bang?,"Well, first off, the big bang *wasn't* an explosion. The rapid expansion of space-time and condensed material and a legit boom-boom explosion are rather different things. Further, the (much) higher energy density in the moments immediately after the Big Bang hindered the process of element formation, rather than helping it.

At over a billion or so degrees kelvin, both protons and neutrons are too energetic to bind. Only once things had begun to expand and cool below this threshold, after about ~2 minutes, could they fuse, resulting in hydrogen (^(1)H) nucleosynthesis, and subsequent fusion into deuterium (^(2)H) and helium-4 (^(4)He). But if it gets *too* cool, fusion and nucleosynthesis stops altogether - so really, there was a critical period between approximately ~3 and ~20 minutes just after the Big Bang for *all* original element synthesis to happen.

After this short window, everything has cooled off, and you have a universe where ~25% of the mass is ^(4)He,  and the other ~75% mostly ^(1)H - with teeny weeny dribs and drabs of ^(2)H, ^(3)He and lithium (^(7)Li) here and there. Given this composition, the only reactions that could form any heavier elements therefore include:

>^(1)H + ^(4)He → ...

>^(4)He + ^(4)He → ...

... but neither produces stable nuclei. There's only:

>^(2)H + ^(7)Li → ^(9)Be

>^(4)He + ^(7)Li → ^(11)B

But given lithium was so scare, these reactions were incredibly unlikely. Trying to build any heavier elements now becomes essentially impossible - the universe is too cool, and the stuff that's in it isn't super useful.

We needed to wait a helluva' long time for the first stars to begin forming things up to carbon (via the [triple alpha process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process), over tens of thousands of years: ^(4)He + ^(4)He → ^(8)Be + ^(4)He → ^(12)C), subsequent fusion to get up to iron, and then supernovae for everything else. The secret ingredient here was time - stars can afford to wait and build up their cupboard of ingredients to get the fun recipes going, something the primordial universe lacked.

**In short:** During the Big Bang, it was too hot and dense for anything to form beyond the simplest gases, and then quickly became too cool for anything else to appear. Stars, by contrast, have plenty of time on their hands.

AskScience,How does climate and climate change impact atmospheric turbulence?,"Airline pilot here. Generally speaking, climate change results in more weather extremes, which will increase our workload. Stronger and more widespread thunderstorms means we'll be deviating potentially further and more often. Colder temperatures in uncommon areas means we'll be de-icing in places and times of the year we may not have used to before. Hotter summer temperatures which degrade aircraft performance means we'll be more restricted in the weight we can take. There are hard weather limits in our operations, and we may find we're hitting these limits more often. 

But better engineering of new aircraft does provide certain reliefs. For example, more efficient and powerful engines give better climb performance and range. Lighter and stronger composite materials let us fly higher, many times above the weather. Better radar and detection systems allows us to paint a higher resolution picture of weather systems resulting in better decision making. But at the end of the day, these improvements won't allow us to just fly into a storm that's over the airport. And I hate to say it, but higher workload means more chance of error, degrading the margin of safety by a measurable amount. There is more risk, but at least it's not anything totally new. We've been dealing with these things for quite a while, and I think we're pretty dang good at navigating them by this point. As an example, microburst and windshear detection systems came to be after a couple high-profile crashes. Now we have these tools to avoid them entirely. It's not a total panacea, but sure does help."
AskScience,"Do all thinking creatures on Earth use neurons? Does an example of non-neuron based biological ""intelligence"" exist?","First, one has to define thinking and  intelligence. 

Animal scientists have argued this for ages. Surely monkeys are intelligent, as are dogs and cats. What about monotremes? Fish? Sharks? Lamprey? Starfish? Worms? Insects? All of these have a centralized nervous system. Is that the definition of intelligence. Jellyfish have nerves, but no centralized processing facility. Are they intelligent or do they just react? Sponges (the most ancient extant animal) have no nerves. Are they intelligent?

Plants communicate with each other warning of herbivory, within and between species. Is that intelligence?

Slime molds live as unicellular organisms when food is abundant,  only to group up in worm like structures to search for greener pastures. If not found, they metamorphose into what resembles a fungal fruiting body? So are  they unicellular or multicellular? Is that intelligence? 

Intelligence is a human derived construct, not easily applicable to the vast diversity of living organisms."
AskScience,"Suppose I have a container of water with a ball floating on top of it. I put it outside overnight and the water freezes. Since the water's volume increases as it freezes, the ball is raised. Where does the increased gravitational potential energy come from?","The energy released from the crystalization goes towards increasing the potential energy of the top of the water. 

Freezing water releases energy to the surroundings, usually in the form of heat (the water gets colder, while the surroundings get warmer). It's the same effect as a handwarmer.... when the pack crystalizes, the energy released is absorbed by your hands, which get warmer.

In your hypothetical, (if the ball actually does raise up) I'd expect the water to freeze at an infinitesimally lower temperature than typical at your conditions. 

I'd more expect the water to rise around the ball, but certainly can't know until doing it haha."
AskScience,Are Bird courtship dances genetic or learned?,We have figured out that certain song birds (passerines) have learned songs while others have genetic/innate song repertoires.

(This comment is primarily for visibility of the post since I’m too tired right now to search for and include sources).
AskScience,How are the two explanations of pressure in a fluid (kinetic and gravitational) related?,"The first explanation implicitly requires gravity, or some other external force, because without a force holding the fluid together, those little collisions will just bounce all the molecules apart in quite short order. This is what distinguishes a fluid from a solid. 

A solid, even if subjected to essentially zero external force (pressure), maintains structural integrity because the bonds between the constituent particles are strong enough that it's kinetically unlikely for any given particle to gain enough energy through random fluctuation to escape from the bulk. Now, of course, even solids, if subjected to true vacuum, will evaporate over time, given enough time, but at typical temperatures and pressures for most applications for solid materials used structurally, you don't have to worry about your solid subliming.

Fluids, on the other hand, have to have some external force applied to confine them to a particular region. If they don't, the fluid particles will bounce off of each other and whatever surroundings they do have in the bulk, and in the direction where they don't have a constraint, they'll just keep going indefinitely. This is what happens if you have a pressure vessel that's got a pinhole leak: there's net acceleration of fluid towards the leak because there is no surface there to provide balancing force to confine the fluid anymore.

As for why pressure induced by gravity is uniform, that's guaranteed by the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium. Imagine a tiny parcel of fluid. Because fluids flow when subjected to pressure, if the pressure felt by this tiny parcel of fluid was different in any direction, it would flow in the direction of the net applied force. Since we are saying that there is no net fluid flow in hydrostatics, pressure for any tiny parcel of fluid has to be isotropic."

AskScience,When the earth's magnetic poles flip is it instant or would it be slow enough that compasses can follow it as it changes?,"It's definitely not instant on human timescales. In terms of geomagnetic reversals, these are not really ""flips"" in a simple sense, but more like a somewhat chaotic drift of the geomagnetic poles from being near one rotational axis to the other (e.g., [Channel & Lehman, 1997](https://www.nature.com/articles/39570)). In detail though, while we can still approximate the positions of the two magnetic poles (i.e., approximate the field as a [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole)) during a reversal, in reality what seems to be happen during reversals is that (1) the overall field intensity is significantly diminished and (2) the non-dipole components (i.e., multi-pole components of the field) become more dominant during the reversal (e.g., [Valet et al., 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03674), [Valet  & Fournier, 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015RG000506)). 

With respect to the timescale of the reversal, we (geologists) often discuss geomagnetic reversals as occurring ""rapidly"" (in terms of how long it takes for the field to reverse), but the important thing to remember is that we're talking ""rapid"" in a geologic time sense, not a human timescale sense. Most records (and simulations e.g., [Coe et al., 2000](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2000.0578)) of reversals suggest that the intensity of the field likely declines for hundreds to thousands of years preceding the reversal and also takes hundreds to thousands of years to ""recover"" after the reversal. The compilation of several well preserved reversals by Valet et al. ([2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11491)) highlights that all of these can be described by a 3 stage process, (1) a precursor ""excursion"", (2) the reversal, and (3) a rebound ""excursion"". Figure 4b in there paper is the most clear about what this means, but basically, in the precursor phase the pole will drift from the original pole to close to the equator over the course of ~1250 years and then drift back to it's original location over another ~1250 years (so 2500 years for the whole precursor).  The actual reversal occurs ~1000 years after this precursor and itself takes ~1000 to complete, i.e., the pole drifts from its original location to its new location 180 degrees away. Then relatively shortly after the reversal, there is a rebound (similar to the precursor) where the newly reversed pole drifts back to the equator and then back to the new position over another ~2500 year period. 

The above appears to be the default behavior for a variety of reversals, but there is variability. The absolute fastest reversal we've ever found a record of skipped the precursor stage from above and the actual reversal took ~100 years and was followed by a more typical duration ""rebound"" (e.g., [Sagnotti et al., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/199/2/1110/618671), [Sagnotti et al., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/204/2/798/593407)).

**TL;DR** from paleomagnetic records of past field reversals, these are best described as drifts from one pole to the other (with both a precursor and rebound phases where the pole moves to the equator and then back to either the original or new pole location) with the whole process spanning ~8-10 thousand years and the main reversal taking ~1 thousand years. The absolute fastest we've ever found is a reversal that took ~100 years. So yes, definitely slow enough to follow with a compass over your entire life in the ""extremely rapid"" case or over the span of *many* generations in the more default case."
AskScience,How does immunity to larger internal parasites such as worms work?,"I can't say for sheep specifically, but most immune response is targeted at initial infection with the parasite.

In human helminthiasis, the main defenders are T-lymphocytes and eosinophils. They produce a ton of cytokines that are mainly focused on damaging/inhibiting eggs or [young, very small parasites](https://youtu.be/wDvxLSA6kN4) during initial infection. B cells and antibodies may be involved, but--once again--antibodies are not going to have substantive effects on the type of large intestinal worms you are talking about.

While I'm sure the host body has some immune tricks to tackle adult helminths, and others can hopefully chime in with them, by the time you have a chronic infection with large worms the parasite-host relationship is pretty established. Many helminths produce [immunomodulating compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_parasitic_worms_on_the_immune_system) which actively tell the immune system to not fight the worm, and, for the most part, the host is now a host and spontaneous recovery without some sort of medical intervention is unlikely."
AskScience,"Do all herbivores possess 4 stomachs like a cow, or is the cow completely unique?","The short answer: no to both. 

The longer answer: the cow is not unique, being in the category of herbivore known as ruminant, which means simply that the animal possesses a rumen. They are called foregut digesters, because their digestion goes through multiple stages before entering the hindgut. Other animals which experience foregut fermentation (the proper term for the process) include not only other ruminants such as goats and sheep and rhinoceros, but also some rodents and marsupials.

Animals with hindgut fermentation can be herbivores. Rabbits and horses are hindgut digesters, as examples. So not all herbivores possess a rumen, but the cow is not completely unique.

Longer and more detailed answer: The cow does not have four stomachs; what it actually has is four separate parts of one digestive system, not counting intestine, etc, said parts being rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum.  There are two general types of bacteria for digestion in the rumen of a cow: amylolytic bacteria, which break down starch,  and cellulolytic bacteria, which break down cellulose. Feed is chewed up by the cow and ends up as a fibrous mat floating at the top of the rumen, where the cellulolytic bacteria goes to work breaking it down into smaller particles which sink lower, to where the amylolytic bacteria go to work. 

The balance of these bacteria is very important as too much starch will cause serious, potentially deadly problems for the cow  as the cellulolytic bacteria reproduce more slowly than the amylolytic bacteria can. Starvation of the cellulolytic bacteria because of too much starch and not enough cellulose coincides with rapid reproduction of the amylolytic bacteria which will then fall to starvation as they digest all the starch available and begin to die off, creating gases that increase pressure in the cow's abdomen (the condition called bloat). Once this condition is too far advanced the cow will enter lactic acidosis - by which point treatment is rarely successful."
AskScience,How does Parental Age affects the Probability of Having Healthy Offspring?,"Thoughts of a medical doctor here: 

There’s probably presentation bias in your summary. Women at advanced age are more likely to have health insurance, health care and seek care. Their pregnancies are likely more intentional. 

You’ll have less miscarriages at a younger age simply because you’ll have more abortions, and also because your miscarriages may be less frequent due to less birth defects that don’t carry to term, a driving force in the miscarriages as well. 

Young women are probably less likely to report miscarriages they had or get documented healthcare at all related to non-term/early  miscarriage pregnancy. 

Younger women’s bodies may also better clear miscarriages from the uterus without intervention and so never realize they were pregnant at all and just think they had an irregular or heavy menses. 

There are so many reasons for the variations in the statistics, but there are certainly statistically significant differences by age not explained simply by presentation bias. I was just pointing out a factor that might artificially distance the reported figures. 

It’s generally thought though that 1/5 to 1/4 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, not just in the older population. Older women may also be more inclined to carry a fetus with a known birth defect to term because of difficulty conceiving and desire to have a child."
AskScience,"Since the bodies cells are replaced every so often, how can radiation cause cancer 10+ years later?","If a cell is irradiated, its DNA may be damaged.

AskScience,Is the speed of light relative to the observer? How does travel in space work?,"The basis of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) is that all observers will measure the speed of light to be 'c' (aka, ~3e8 m/s). I think the most succinct way of describing it is this thought experiment. 

First, let's think of an example not using light. You are driving in a tank that can drive at 50 m/s (fast tank), and the tank can shoot a shell that travels 500 m/s. You are driving in the tank, I am on the ground as you drive past me and shoot your gun. What do we both see? You see the shell traveling away from you at 500 m/s. I, however, see the shell traveling at 550 m/s- the shell inherits the speed from the tank, and the velocities add together. (Side note, but if you want to see an example of this, but just in reverse, there is this cool [Mythbuster video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuI118nhzc) where they shoot a ball out the back of a truck, where the truck is traveling at the speed the ball is shot, so the ball appears just to fall straight down). This is regular physics, behaving probably how most people think physics works. 

But now, say I am on Earth, and you are on a spaceship, and your spaceship is traveling at 99% the speed of light relative to Earth. You turn on a flashlight. What do we both see?

You see something similar to what you saw in the tank example up above. You would still measure the light leaving your spaceship at 'c', just like you saw in the tank the shell leaving at it's speed, 500 m/s. 

But for me, things are different. I see you traveling at 99% c, and the light traveling at 'c', so the light will be going 1% faster than you. That is, if you turned on a laser pointer and pointed it at something 300,000,000 km away, I would see the light there there in 100 seconds, and you would get there in 101 seconds- the light is traveling 1% faster than you.

This is the basis of special relativity, and all of the other attributes of special relativity can actually be derived from the fact that everyone measures the same speed of light, and adding in- we both have to agree on what happened. So, how does this work? How can we both measure something traveling at 'c' but you see it getting out in front of you way faster than I do? Well, this is where length contraction and time dilation come in. Me, on Earth seeing you zoom by, will see a clock on your spaceship ticking slower than a clock next to me ([time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation)), and that sensor the laser pointer is hitting that's 300M m away? You will measure it to be less than 300 M m away ([length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction)). So, the trade off for us both measuring the same speed of light, is we no longer have the same time or length measurements. 

A very important result of all of this is the axiom ""there are no preferred inertial frame."" This is a way of saying ""there is no universal rest frame, any frame which is inertial (which just means, not accelerating) is equally valid."" Because since the speed of light is always measured at 'c' by everyone, there is no way to say ""I am at rest, because I measure the speed of light to be it's ""true"" speed, and you are not at rest because you measure a different speed."" No, any inertial frame is equally valid. It's just as valid to say, as I sit at my desk, that I am stationary as it is to say I am traveling at 99.999999% the speed of light. 

This is all related to your first question- can you have an infinite velocity with infinite fuel? And the answer is no- no one will ever travel faster than the speed of light. An easy way to know? Well, let's say you were traveling at 'c' as measured by me, on Earth, and you turned on your flashlight. Now, I would have to see you, and the light traveling at the same speed- aka, the light is not getting out in front of you at all. But you have to see the light leaving away from you at 'c'. There is no amount of length contraction and time dilation that can account for that. Thus, it is impossible to travel at the speed of light."
AskScience,"If mountains are formed from the interaction of tectonic plates buckling together, could there be a noticeable 'seam' between the two old plates somewhere along a mountain range?","Yes, the term you're looking for is a [suture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suture_%28geology%29). It's worth discussing a few other points here though.

> If mountains are formed from the interaction of tectonic plates buckling together

So, a better way to think about this is that collisional mountain ranges (like the Himalaya) form because one plate is shoved/dragged under another, as opposed to them ""buckling"". Before a collisional mountain range starts to form, the two pieces of continental lithosphere that will eventually collide to form the mountains are separated by an ocean basin (floored by oceanic lithosphere), typically with a [subduction zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) between them. As subduction continues, the ocean basin shrinks until eventually continental lithosphere enters the subduction zone and the mountain range starts to form slowly. The slab of subducted material that is still hanging out in the mantle (and attached to the continental portion of the plate that is ""going under"" the other) is typically an important driver for mountain range formation (for more on what makes the plates move in general and the role of subduction, check out [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/)). If you want an overview of mountain building (and the follow ups), reading up on the [Wilson Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Cycle) might be helpful. The Wilson Cycle is heavily idealized and all of the steps almost never happen in the exact order, but the general processes described in the Wilson Cycle do happen.

> My guess on it has to do with either the initial formation of a mountain being quite violent and hot enough to fuse the rising summits together

The formation of mountains isn't really any more violent than any other plate interaction. The movement of one plate under the other is accomplished by earthquakes, but the same was true for the subduction zone before the mountain range and virtually any other plate boundary. Collisional mountains form slowly, like most every other geologic process. Sutures can be marked by magmatism and things like plutons, etc., but not always.

> could there be a noticeable 'seam' between the two old plates somewhere along a mountain range?

Back to this idea of a suture, the one tricky thing is that not all sutures are easily recognizable, but many are. Because mountain ranges are preceded by the existence of an ocean basin and subduction, some sutures are marked by [ophiolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiolite), basically bits of oceanic crust that have been scraped up and trapped between the two continental plates defining what we would call an *ophiolitic suture*. Ophiolitic sutures are relatively easy to notice because ophiolites are pretty unique and pretty much always indicate a suture. The formation of mountain ranges can also lead to a fair bit of melting within the crust, so sometimes older sutures in heavily eroded ranges can be recognized by zones of igneous intrusions. They also tend to represent zones of significant deformation, so can be recognizable that way. However, not all sutures have ophiolites or other clear outward signs that they are in fact a suture, especially in younger mountain ranges where there has not been as much exhumation and erosion of deeper rocks. These would be better described as *cryptic sutures*, which basically means in the field they kind of look like any other fault. Identifying cryptic sutures is a bit more challenging and usually requires doing a lot of work on the basic geology of the fault bounded blocks within a mountain range to try to identify where there is a major change in some aspect of the bedrock that might tell you the bits on either side used to be separated by a large basin. Here for example is a [paper](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/135981/tect20504.pdf?sequence=1) that attempts to look for and define the location of a cryptic suture in the Greater Caucasus mountains using where sediment was coming from in different parts of the mountain range and hypothesizing that a cryptic suture exists between where there is a major change in sediment source."
AskScience,How do we know that dark matter isn't just ordinary matter our instruments can't detect?,"For example, we cannot rule out that the dark matter might be asteroid-mass black holes (e.g. figure 10 of [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12778.pdf#section*.44)). Why couldn't it just be asteroids?

The main lines of evidence against such a possibility are related to the early universe. This is a time when the the universe was very hot. Asteroids could not exist in such an environment; they would dissociate into diffuse plasma like all the rest of the ordinary matter. In this context, all ordinary matter is equally detectable, in the sense that it has an equal impact on what we observe. But what do we observe?

1) The relative abundances of light elements throughout the universe. We understand nuclear physics and can predict the ratios of hydrogen, deuterium, helium, etc. that should have emerged from the Big Bang. What we find is largely consistent with ordinary matter comprising only 5% of the total energy density today. If the density of ordinary matter were higher, we should find less deuterium and more helium than we do. The first figure of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9903300.pdf) (page 9) illustrates nicely how the primordial element abundances depend on how much ordinary matter there is.

2) Temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background. In the early universe, the ordinary matter and photons were tightly coupled, which led to such effects as pressure oscillations and sound waves. Dark matter, on the other hand, only interacted via gravity. This causes them to have very different effects on the evolution of temperature and density variations in the early universe, which manifest themselves to us in the cosmic microwave background. [Here's an animation](http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/animbut/anim1.html) of how changing the density of ordinary matter (""baryons"") would alter the ""power spectrum"" of the cosmic microwave background temperature, which is something we have measured extremely precisely, e.g. [the top panel of this figure](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/09/aa33880-18/F9.html)."
AskScience,"If “dark matter” is a hypothesis, how can we know it has an effect on ordinary matter?","We know that something is having an effect on ordinary matter and ""dark matter"" is our best bet for what that is.

From astronomical observations we know roughly how much visible mass there is in various galaxies and other structures. Simply by measuring the amount of light emitted and fitting that to our models. But we can also observe how these structures interact with each other due to gravity.

And the gravitational interactions don't match up with the amount of mass we expect there to be. Not by a long shot. So there is either a lot more matter than we thought there would be. And that extra matter doesn't seem to affect the matter we do see in any way other than through gravity. Or our understanding of how gravity works is completely wrong.

While that second explanation might be more appealing than the notion that most of the mass in the universe is stuff we have never actually seen, there have been multiple different and independent observations, measuring different astronomical phenomena that agree with the hypothesis of the extra, unseen matter. And observations and experiments on a more local scale have shown that our understanding of gravity lines up very well with what we observe.

All these pieces of evidence suggest, but do not prove, the presence of a large amount of matter that is spread across galaxies and that doesn't interact with other matter in ways that we can measure right now except for its gravitational pull. Locally, near a dense object of regular matter, say near a star, the amount of this ""dark matter"" is so low that it can be ignored, but adding it all up across a galaxy, it adds a large amount of mass.

So far there's no direct evidence of dark matter. We've not seen the particles that make up this mysterious substance. We haven't even narrowed down the number of potential explanations of what it could be to a single one, which would greatly help the search.

But most physicists consider the hypothesis of dark matter to be very plausible and searches are underway for the particles that could make up this dark matter. Until we find something, it remains a hypothesis. But we do know that we're missing something, because what we calculate and what we measure does not agree."
AskScience,Are people with autoimmune diseases less likely to get viral infections? How about cancers?,"People being treated for autoimmune disorders need their immune system suppressed because it's attacking otherwise healthy tissue, organs, systems, etc. They are more susceptible to viral and secondary infection.

Source- I am immune compromised. I receive immunosuppressive infusions regularly."
AskScience,How does dish soap eliminate bacteria?,"A bacteria cell consists of many different parts, but the relevant one here is called the ""Bi-Lipid Layer"", which is a layer of lipids that enclose the cell and essentially function as its skin.

Lipids are a group of compounds that include organic fats, oils, and waxes.

In general, most things are either hydrophobic (fat/oil soluble, but not water soluble) or hydrophillic (water soluble but not lipid soluble).  Things are usually one or the other.

Detergents are somewhat unique in the fact that they are both hydrophillic *and* hydrophobic - they bind to both oil and water, and allow them to be bonded together in very close proximity, where they would usually very strongly repel each other.

So, you have a bacteria with its lipidous cell wall, immersed in water.  The water is normally repelled by this layer, preventing the bacteria from dissolving into it.
Enter a molecule of detergent.  This molecule bonds strongly to the bacteria's protective lipid layer.  This causes a very strong attraction to the surrounding water, while adjacent lipid molecules, which are not bonded to detergent, strongly repel the water.  This bonding and attraction between a water molecule and the lipid molecule is now so strong that the bacterial cell wall rips and ruptures apart, thereby spilling its innards and killing the cell.

Edit: a commenter corrected my phrasing - the terminology is lipid bilayer, not bi-lipid layer."

could explain these differences. In general, birds have higher dispersal capabilities than
mammals, and this dispersal may provide more opportunities for host-switching [33]. The
sedentary and asocial nature of pocket gophers, for example, has been used to explain the
high level of host-specificity and cospeciation in their lice [5]. Another major difference is
that avian feather lice have little interaction with the host immune system because they
mainly consume feathers, which are inert, while mammalian lice consume blood or sebum
and directly interact with the host immune system [61,62]. This interaction in mammal lice
may lead to an evolutionary arms race and more coadaptation between mammals and their
lice, making host-switching more difficult."""
AskScience,"Ask Anything Wednesday - Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science",What are the most promising hypotheses for why galaxies rotate? What is the relevance of black holes?
AskScience,Why are submarines and torpedoes blunt instead of being pointy?,"A pointy nose *isn't* the best shape for reducing drag.  Because it's longer than a blunt nose there's more surface area for friction to act on.  This is ""form drag"", and a teardrop shape with a blunt nose and a sharp tail does the best at minimizing it.  So that's the shape most submarines and airplanes are based on.  Check out a passenger airliner: the nose isn't very sharp.

Where a sharp nose does help is in pushing the air or water out of the way more gradually and less abruptly.  That means less energy gets lost in creating waves: surface waves in water, or sound waves in air.  And so ships that travel at the water's surface, and supersonic airplanes, have sharp noses to minimize ""wave drag""."
AskScience,"After a surgery, what happens to the air that was inside the incision?","It is absorbed by the body cavity lining, makes its way into the blood stream, and is exhaled. The absorption happens pretty much exactly the way it happens in your lungs (diffusion), there's just less surface area to work with than in the highly-branched lung interior, so it takes a bit longer.

O2 and CO2 are absorbed pretty quickly into the blood compared to the nitrogen gas (N2) that makes up the majority of air. So when laproscopic surgeons insuflate a surgical area with gas to give them a little more room to see and work, [they intentionally use CO2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/11aj45n/after_a_surgery_what_happens_to_the_air_that_was/)...which helps any gas left behind after the surgery to be absorbed more quickly, and also protects the patient in case a (small) bubble got into the bloodstream (as a bubble of pure CO2 will be absorbed into the blood faster and thus might do less damage than a longer-lasting nitrogen bubble.) But even a regular air mix at an incision site will be absorbed before too long."
AskScience,Is there empirical evidence for the existence of the logical part of the mind and the emotional part of the mind?,"Yes and no.

We're aware of pathways and circuits in the brain that are related to emotional experience and also circuits related to conscious decision making.

The thing is that logic and emotion are complicated and involve multiple, often overlapping and intersecting parts. For example you have memory, sensory inputs, mood, executive override, regulation of body processes and many more parts contributing to the experience of ""emotion"".

Experiencing emotion does not involve just one part of the brain or even just one pathway.

You could make an extremely reductive and simplistic statement and say that logic is more related to outer structures of the cortices and emotion is more related to inner structures like the limbic system and basal ganglia, but this would be an incredible oversimplification. But I guess its a place to start if you are interested in neuro anatomy/physio."

AskScience,How do astronomers share coordinates with each other?,"The sky has a similar set of coordinates as the Earth - in fact, the coordinates have the same names: latitude and longitudes. You’re correct in that the sky appears to move above us as the Earth rotates, but we astronomers have solved this by specifying a point on the sky that we define as always having coordinates (0,0). So, from the point of view of someone on Earth, the (0,0) point moves as the sky apparently moves above us.

The choice of where we’ve decided (0,0) to be is somewhat arbitrary, but if you’re curious, it’s defined as the position of the Sun on the sky at the vernal equinox (around March 21st)."
AskScience,Help settle a debate i am having: Does the way weight is distributed in an object affect how buoyant it is in water?,"If the volume and weight are the same, they'll both experience the exact same bouyant force. 

The only thing the center of mass dictates is their orientation in the water. I.e. one with centralized center of mass will float evenly, while one with significant mass at one end would float with that end depressed to a degree (depending on the ratio).

In your scenario, they'd both begin to lift at the same time. If one of them floats at an angle, that one might drag a bit longer due to the depth of the heavier end, and so might take longer to clear the ground than the one that floated perfectly evenly, but overall they should begin to float at the same time."
AskScience,Do people suffering a Persistent vegetative state sleep while in coma?,"Well technically no as they're not in a coma.

A persistent vegetative state is not a coma they are not interchangeable terms.

At the most basic level in a coma the person appears to be asleep but can't be roused whereas a person in a persistent vegetative state appears to be awake but is non responsive to to any stimuli. In a coma the higher brain functions still exist whereas in a persistent vegetative state the more complex areas of the brain are dead and gone.

Do they sleep? Yes as complex thought, reaction to stimuli, intelligence and personality are not needed to sleep. What's left of the brain can handle sleep as technically amoebas sleep.

PVS is different to brain death as some of the brain is still functioning and no there is no hope of recovery as what makes the person themselves is dead and gone."
AskScience,Do different types/colonies of ants have different architectural characteristics from one another?,"Oh yeah. But I wouldn’t call it culture, more like pheromone-evolved instinct. With a sprinkle of geographic determinism.

Different regions have varying soils and food sources available to the ants. Much like humans and early cement, the little civil engineers have to make it work with what’s available. Sand is more often used to make mounds. Loamy soil is easier to dig into and has enough integrity to support multiple layers of underground networks. 

Some ants have invented the ant toilet. Or rather a designated spot where they all put their poop. Some use their poop to grow fungal gardens. The queen will take a bit of the garden from her original colony with her in her mouth to start another when she goes off to found her own colony, like a sourdough starter. For real.

In the Amazon there are some wild examples of specialization (as the Amazon do). Leaf cutter ants make mega-cities and create ant “highways”. Fire ants build bridges with their bodies. Bullet ants are so metal they don’t really bother building nests and just inhabit trees.

All of this, and pretty much everything ants do, is driven by pheromones and instinct. I hope we get to see a further exploration into the relationship of ant DNA variation and pheromone response in our lifetimes. Only 2.5% of leaf cutter colonies founded by a new queen make it, selection is happening at a genetic level. Whack."
AskScience,"Can the static tension of tectonic plates be quantified, or how are predictions about future quakes made?","> Can the static tension of tectonic plates be quantified?

So, the way we as geologists would discuss this would be in terms of measuring the magnitude and direction of stress(es) within the crust. There are a variety of ways we can directly measure stress, e.g., [borehole breakouts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/borehole-breakout), [overcoring](http://www.hydrofrac.com/hfo_home.html), etc., which we can then use to produce maps of stress like the [World Stress Map](https://www.world-stress-map.org/download). Ultimately though, while maps of stress are useful for some aspects of assessing earthquake hazard, we cannot directly apply these to ""predicting"" earthquake hazards as this would require knowing much more about the stress history (as opposed to short term measurements), how stress changes with depth, the amount of accumulated strain on individual faults, the strength of individual faults, along with a whole host of other properties. Stress maps and estimates are one part of what we can do to assess hazards though.

> how are predictions about future quakes are made?

Here we want to be explicit about what we can and can't do and moreover what is implied by specific terms when used by professionals. Geologists, seismologists, and others who work on natural hazards often draw an important distinction between *forecasts* and *predictions.* This may seem pedantic, but these two terms imply very different things when being used by people like myself who works on natural hazards. Forecasts are hopefully partially intuitive from weather forecasting and we can use this to explore the implications of these two terms in this context. A weather *forecast* would be something like, ""There is a 80% chance of rain today in this region"", whereas a weather *prediction* would be ""There will be exactly 1 cm of rain, falling at a rate of 1 cm / hr, starting at exactly 4 pm at this precise location."" I.e., for something to be a prediction implies certainty in time, location, and magnitude. Generally, we can forecast the weather, but we cannot predict it and the same is true for earthquakes. The reason we cannot predict earthquakes is much the same reason we cannot predict weather, i.e., incomplete data characterizing a non-linear dynamic (i.e., chaotic) system. The utility of the two are also the same, i.e., even though we can't predict the weather in a perfect sense, the forecast helps us plan (i.e., if you saw the forecast from above, you'd probably bring a rain coat or umbrella with you, etc.). If you want to read even more about why we can't *predict* earthquakes in the true sense of the word, [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/eathquake_prediction/) goes into more detail.

For earthquakes, where do the forecasts from? Mixtures of basic mapping of fault locations and geometries, theoretical understanding of earthquake mechanics from both observations and modeling, a variety of geodetic measurements and measurements of stress (like from the first part), and records of earthquake histories from [paleoseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoseismology), historical seismology, and/or [archaeoseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoseismology). From all of these, we build assessments of how often particular faults have earthquakes, what the variability in style/size of those earthquakes are, time since the last event, and other various details we can glean from the geologic record. In the end, we end up with things largely similar to our weather forecast example, i.e., a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, like the various [ones for the US](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/seismic-hazard-model-maps-and-site-specific-data). These focus on different regions and consider different lengths of time (going back to the weather forecast analogy, largely equivalent to the difference between a daily forecast and the 10 day forecast, etc.). If you look at many of these, you'll see they are presented in a somewhat similar way to weather forecasts, i.e., the probability that a particular area will experience significant shaking in the relevant time frame covered by the map. Just like the weather forecast, while not a prediction, it provides a tool for us to assess risk and make preparations. I.e., much in the same way a forecast of sunny skies vs a chance of rain might determine your choice of clothes for the day, living in an area with a 20% chance of experiencing significant shaking in the next 10 years has very different implications than living in an area with a 1% chance of experiencing significant shaking in the next 10 years and you (and governments, etc) would/could/should respond accordingly."
AskScience,What is the orientation of a monarch caterpillar/butterfly while in the chrysalis stage?,"A caterpillar will, usually hang upside down from a branch when forming its chrysalis. Then the butterfly will emerge from the lower end, or the bottom of the chrysalis. Usually with its head poking out alongside unveiling its back and wings first, as the rest of the body then is pushed out. They then hang upside down while their wings dry out and unfurl until they can fly.
 
However during the chrysalis stage the body of the caterpillar kind of turns into a jelly and reforms. As the caterpillar basically turns into a liquid as it’s body under goes metamorphosis. During this time if you were to cut open the chrysalis it would still be oriented downward with its “head” facing down. But there wouldn’t be as much of a body depending on when you were to open it. More so just a goo or jelly of body parts on a vague insect shape"
AskScience,Native aluminium on Earth or other planets?,"Native aluminium [does exist on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_aluminium), though it's very, very rare. It's not clear to me at least that this rarity is due to biogenic oxygen the way native iron is, though - pure aluminium doesn't rust like iron does, and it just gets a transparent hard oxide layer on the outside. In fact, the aluminium you interact with on a regular basis is already coated in this oxide layer. So the fact that it's almost exclusively found in compounds in minerals is likely due to geological processes rather than biological, as I understand it."

AskScience,Why are we no longer contagious even if not all influenza symptoms are gone?,"So couple things. The symptoms you get from the flu are not from the virus itself, it is the immune response to the virus. Don't believe that? Well when you get infected with the flu (or cold), you are infected and infectious before you have any symptoms at all. So there is a day, maybe two you are spreading it around but are not aware you are even infected. My point with this is to show you it is not the virus infecting you causing the symptoms otherwise you would get them as soon as you were infected. Then you start to get symptoms. As mentioned those symptoms are a function of the immune system fighting the virus, not from the virus itself. When you get infected with a virus interferon will be released in your body to help stop the spread of the virus internally. Also so happens interferon makes you feel flu like, and that is likely part of the reason you feel sick (although I am sure some other aspects of the immune system contribute to. But if you ever head to inject interferon as MS patients do, you would notice you feel sick with flu like symptoms. OK we have established your symptoms are related to your immune response, not from the virus itself. So you have been asymptomatic then sick for about 6 days and you are getting a little better but still have symptoms but don't seem infectious anymore. What gives? Well during that time you body has been working hard to make antibodies against the virus as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes and other to destroy not only the virus, but also the virus infected cells. Once you body has produced antibodies against the virus they work surprisingly quick. Those antibodies will bind to any free virus which results in other cells swallowing and destroying the virus in some instances, or the antibodies might bind to the virus in a way so that it cannot infect another cell as the antibodies block the viral binding protein. When you reach this point you are not going to be infectious as there will not be free virus available to cough or sneeze out. The antibodies are very very efficient at finding their targets fast, and the the rest of the immune response to that antibody bound virus is fast too. At this point you are not contagious but you immune system is still involved in the fight so you will retain some symptoms for a few days that slowly get better. During that later period your cytotoxic T lymphocytes found and killed every cell that had the virus in it, all of them. The antibodies clearered the virus outside of cells including in nasal secretions etc. You then gradually feel recovered and this is when the immune system has not only won the battle, now it is time to throttle back the immune response as there is no more virus present. As it does this your symptoms disappear as your body goes back to ""healthy mode"" where the immune activity does not make you feel ill. This is simplified a bit as the immune system is quite complex but captures it pretty good."
AskScience,Why are there not just giant balls of neutrons floating around?,"While neutrons do feel attractive interactions with other neutrons, it's simply not strong enough for a bound state to exist in a system with multiple neutrons and no protons. (Not until you have a number of neutrons so astronomically large, the system is bound gravitationally, i.e. a neutron star.)

So there's no bound system of two neutrons, three neutrons, four neutrons, etc., and no way to form a ""neutron ball"".

>I'm assuming that this question also relates to another question of mine that being ""why can't I just bombard unstable isotopes of massive atoms such as oganesson with neutrons until the strong force granted by them eventually overpowers the immense electromagnetic force of all the protons."" As they're both the same question of why doesn't infinitely adding neutrons to a nucleus make it infinitely more stable.

In whatever bound nucleus you start with, the strong force is already ""winning"" over the electromagnetic force, since the system is bound at all. If you start with a stable nucleus, you can add more neutrons to a point, filling higher and higher neutron orbitals without filling anymore proton orbitals. But at some point you'll reach a state where it's energetically favorable for the next neutron to convert into a proton, and the nucleus will be unstable to beta decay. If you continue to add neutrons, you'll eventually reach another point where the interaction between the nucleus and an external neutron is so weak that there is no bound state for the last neutron. That's called the neutron dripline, because if you add another neutron, it will simply ""drip"" back off on a timescale on the order of 10^(-21) seconds (or possibly longer due to the centrifugal barrier, but still generally very short). So more neutrons does not imply more stability."
AskScience,Why can humans eat chocolate but other animals will die?,"Its the Theobromine and it's also poisonous to us, just at a larger dose.

All things we consume have a LD50 value, that is how much of it consume leads to the death of 50% of the species.

The LD50 for chocolate for Dogs is 300 mg/kg, Cats 200 mg/kg, for humans its 1000 mg/kg.  Given dogs and cats are smaller than us and a need a 3-5x less to be poisonous, a normal serving that is safe to us, may not be to them.

Now, some animals can eat even more chocolate than we can kg for kg.    Rats LD50 for theobromine is over 1200 mg/kg."
AskScience,"Are there any examples of natural hybridization, or any possibilities of this occurring in nature?","Yes, it's actually a pretty standard avenue toward speciation, aka the recognition of a new species [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid\_speciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_speciation)

It's more common in plants but it happens in animals as well. Hybrid animals actually can sometimes reproduce (that's how they can become a new species, after all), depending on the genetic qualities of the parents. Ligers (lion-tigers) are fertile and can mate with other ligers, tigers, or lions. The well-known example of the sterile mule is due to the fact that horses and donkeys donate 32 and 31 chromosomes to their offspring, respectively, so the child of a donkey-horse pairing (a mule) will have an odd number of chromosomes, leaving them unable to reproduce."
AskScience,Is the yearly cycle of varying daylight durations from day to day throughout time consistent? Is the cycle we have today the same as in the 17th century?,"I would consider the possibility that the local government was still using an antiquated system of measuring hours. Prior to the widespread adoption of mechanical clocks, hours were not a fixed length. Dawn to dusk was considered daytime, and dusk to dawn was considered night, and each was divided into 12 hours. The first canonical hour of the day was called Prime, and corresponded to 6am. When the sun was overhead, it was Sext. When the sun set, it was Vespers. The duration between Prime and Vespers was divided into 12 hours, regardless of how long daylight actually lasted. So in the summer, daytime hours were longer than nighttime hours, and in the winter, that was reversed.

That system was dominant throughout Europe until around 1600, when mechanical clocks finally became prevalent enough to replace older options like sundials. It seems possible to me that, by the early 1700s, certain jurisdictions might have still been working out the whole concept that all hours were the same length, and 8pm was daytime in summer and nighttime in winter. It's possible that the ordnance you refer to assumed 8pm was ""a short time after sunset"", while 10pm was ""a long while after sunset, but not yet midnight."""

AskScience,extremely long stick additional questions?,"if you apply force on an object - technically, you only apply that force on the outermost layer of atoms. so you push the outermost layer against the next layer, which itself pushes on the next layer and so on.

there is a maximum speed with which that force can propagate through the object. it is the speed of any pressure wave. the most common pressure wave is a sound wave - so usually, we call this speed the speed of sound. in a rigid object, sound is much faster than in air. the actual value for this speed is dependend on the material. if you have a wooden stick for example, if you push on one end, that force is transmitted through the wood with a speed of about 3500 to 5000 meters per second. which is quite fast.

if your stick is about one meter long and you push on one end, that force can be transmitted fast enough, that it looks as if that force is transmitted instantaneous. you can't push that stick fast enough to notice any delay. therefore the only force you have to apply is that to move the stick itself.

however - if your stick is considerably longer, you notice that delay between your push on the one end and the movement on the other. the stick can't move away fast enough. so you have to compress the stick - or apply the force very slowly. if you compress the stick, you have to apply extra force - you not only have to move the mass of the stick (which is now very high). if you push slow enough, you only have to compress the stick a little bit before that pressure can move through the whole stick.

now take a stick that is long enough to reach to our moon. our moon is about 400 000 kilometers away. the speed of sound in wood is about 5 kilometers per seconds. so - if you push on one end of that stick, it takes about 22 hours (!) until the other end moves. if you push the stick about 10 cm on one end, you have to compress the wood - which takes quite some force. but never mind - that stick would be so heavy that moving it at any speed is an astronomical feat.

have you ever seen a stick of wood about one kilometer long? me neither. no wonder, all of this is not quite intuitive."

The universe is extremely, impossibly large. We would need to make observations from a completely different galaxy and getting that far already is going to be tough. Even better would be making observations from multiple large distances away from Earth. We got our work cut out for use, lol"
AskScience,What limits the maximum RPM of an electric motor?,"Your dad is wrong on several fronts.  In rough terms, motor current = torque, not top speed (that’s more a function of voltage to counter back EMF).  

Also, there are absolutely mechanical limits to maximum motor speed.  At some point, the centripetal acceleration on the rotor exceeds the ability of the rotor to keep itself in one piece and you get a high energy grenade.

Stator inertia doesn’t really impact maximum speed other than it defines the energy in the grenade when you overspeed and explode a rotor."

AskScience,How does google immediately able to report earthquakes?,"I'm assuming you're asking about the Android based earthquake early warning system? All earthquake early warning systems operate using the same basic setup:

1. An array of widely distributed, always-on detectors exists and/or is establsihed
2. A portion of the array detects a signal that may indicate an earthquake and sends a message to some sort of central (automated) hub
3. The central hub collects signals from the array and quickly determines via algorithms / criteria whether the signals from the array are likely to indicate an earthquake and typically makes an estimate of the size and location of the event based on the information from the sensor array
4. The central hub sends a message to users that are connected to the hub and in regions close enough to where the system thinks there is an earthquake that might feel the earthquake and uses what is known about earthquakes (e.g., the speed of seismic waves in various mediums), the particular event (e.g., estimated size and location), and the local geology (e.g., types of materials and their seismic properties) to estimate when the waves might right reach them and some general estimate of intensity.

The above can work because the speed of seismic waves are slower than the speed at which the sensor array can communicate with the hub and the hub can send alerts, where the latter is effectively happening at the speed of light. The main difference between different early warning systems is largely what constitutes the sensor array. For early warning systems operated by governments (e.g., [ShakeAlert](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/earthquake-early-warning-overview) in portions of the US or similar systems in Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, etc.), the sensor array are sets of seismometers distributed throughout an area. A seismometer is effectively a specially housed, oriented, and networked set of very sensitive accelerometers. The [Android based early warning system](https://crisisresponse.google/android-alerts/) capitalizes on the fact that virtually every smartphone has an accelerometer in it and uses a crowdsourced approach in terms of monitoring the location and acceleration of lots of peoples smartphones and assumes that if almost all smartphones in an area start experiencing similar accelerations it maybe a sign of an earthquake (and from there, it largely functions as above). There are other ways to go about crowdsourced approaches as well, e.g., [LastQuake](https://www.emsc-csem.org/faq/lastquake.php) uses the location of people opening the app, going to their website, or tweeting with a few keywords (e.g., earthquake, shaking) - as opposed to direct usage of the phones accelerometers. 

It's important to consider a few common misconceptions about earthquake early warning systems. As described above, these are not detecting precursors to earthquakes, but the earthquakes themselves so these are not ""predicting"" events, but alerting us to in progress events. As such, the amount of warning provided will usually be short (seconds to minutes). This may not seem useful, but when coupled with automatic systems (e.g., systems to halt trains, etc.) and good training (e.g., individuals knowing where/how to quickly take cover), this short time can be invaluable. The limitation on these is that it comes down to a bit of luck (and/or sensor array design) in terms of the amount of warning because fundamentally for somewhere to get a warning;  (1) the earthquake needs to be far enough away from that location for it to be detected and for there a warning to be processed to be sent out and (2) there needs to be a sensor(s) near the epicenter of the earthquake (or at least closer to the epicenter than the location to get a warning). This latter point is where things like ShakeAlert can have an advantage over the Android system since arrays of seismometers are often outside populated areas (to avoid the ""noise"" generated by machines, etc) whereas the Android system basically requires some number of people with phones in an area to detect a potential earthquake. But even for the seismometer based ones, if the epicenter of an event is effectively in a populated area, that populated area won't get an alert (but other neighboring areas might). Finally, these systems can generate false positives. Especially for the seismometer based systems, a large earthquake effectively starts as a small earthquake and then builds. Thus, the system has to make quick decisions based on incomplete data whether the signals it's being fed is indicative of a small earthquake that won't be widely felt (no need to issue an alert) or the beginnings of an event that will be widely felt and strong (need to issue an alert). The ability for the system to make those decisions depends on the way it was programmed but also training data (i.e., the systems get better with time).

**TL;DR** earthquake early warning systems use signals indicative of an earthquake in progress in one area to warn people in adjacent areas that shaking from that earthquake is on its way. The Android (Google) system uses the location and acceleration of peoples phones as the signal. Other early warning systems exist as well using different ""signals"", e.g., arrays of seismometers.

Are modern chickens now the size of older turkeys?,"Even at the more extreme ends, modern chickens are much smaller than old turkeys. A turkey from the early 1900s could have a market weight between 15-25lbs. A modern chicken is sold at around 4-5lbs, but larger roasting chickens can hit 10lbs."
AskScience,"Human beings aside, how do mammals behave regarding eating and drinking: drink before, while, after eating? And is there a better option among these three for human beings?","As you might imagine, for most mammals and other animals, the acts of eating and drinking are divorced out of necessity.  Grazers and other herbivores tend to continuously eat for long periods, while carnivores eat whenever they procure meat.  Meanwhile, drinking involves taking a separate trip to the stream/lake/watering hole.

In general, modeling your behavior after animals won't be the path to the ""most instinctive, natural way"" in any beneficial manner.  Animals don't eat and drink together because their food and water sources are typically in separate places, not because that provides some form of physiological or psychological benefit."
AskScience,Are there any pre-industrial cases of solar power that didn't involve combustion?,"[Pliny the Elder](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D10) wrote about intrepid Romans mining giant natural crystal from the Alps while suspended on a rope, then polishing it into a lens, then using focused sunlight to cauterize wounds and light fires. 

It is unclear if Archimedes really used solar power as a weapon against the Roman Navy, but he would have understood enough optics to try. Imaginative recreations have lit mockup Roman warships on fire provided the enemy is covered in flammable pitch and chooses to cooperate by holding still close to shore."
AskScience,Why do some substances dissolve in water better at lower temperatures..is there an optimal dissolving temperature for each substance?,"Dissolving is a bit more complicated than just mixing with water. Bonds are broken between ions, which requires energy, but then bonds form between the ions and water molecules, which releases energy. If the process, overall, requires more energy than is released, then higher temperatures lead to increased dissolving. If the process releases more energy than is absorbed, then cooler temperatures lead to increased dissolving. 

This explanation only looks at the energy arguments. Entropy arguments also factor into the explanation.

A common substance that dissolves better in cold water is limestone, (calcium carbonate), and the fact that solubility decreases with temperature leads to many of the problems with hard water."

AskScience,Why so many neurons to manage limb movements in humans while small animals get by with so few?,"Your muscle cells can only fire at maximum force (they are either off or fully activated), and cannot be actively shut down - you just have to wait for relaxation after the nerve stops firing. As a result, to have any sort of subtlety, we have tens of thousands of muscle cells in a muscle, with a few dozen per nerve, so we can only activate a small fraction of the total muscle mass to get a small force. 

Arthropod muscles have graded responses where increased nerve stimulation increases force, and can respond to inhibitory signals to decrease force.  As a result, they can get subtly graded force responses from just a few (larger) muscle cells and neurons.

Why is each the way it is?  No idea.  Both diverged early in animal evolution, shortly after nerve and muscle became different tissues, so most likely each just hit upon a different solution to neural control and stuck with it."

AskScience,I read that we haven't had this much CO2 in the atmosphere since 5 million years ago. How much higher was the sea level back then?,"[Figure 1 from Miller et al., 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aaz1346) includes a paired record of global sea level and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere for the Cenozoic (i.e., for the last 65 million years). For the sea level curve, what looks like a lot of scatter is really more just fluctuations on shorter time intervals driven by [Milankovitch forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles), but there is definitely uncertainty in these estimates. For the CO2 curve, there is a good amount of scatter reflecting differing sensitivity and uncertainties in the different proxy data used to construct the record. If we focus on the smoothed sea level curve in panel D and whats amounts to a smoothed CO2 curve in E (the red fuzzy line), we can see that we have to go back to about 20 million years before CO2 concentrations were solidly higher than today (i.e., > 400 ppm). At that time, sea level was broadly higher, ranging from just a bit above modern to 10s of meters above modern, but with a fair amount of variability. As an aside, if you want to see a much longer record of CO2, you can check out [Figure 4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845/figures/4) from [Foster et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845), but they don't display a sea level curve, so you'd have to sort of eyeball it with a similar length of sea level record, like [Figure 1 from Miller et al., 2005](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1116412).

At geologic timescales like these, it's also important to remember atmospheric temperature (and ice volume) are not the only drivers of sea level. For example, changes in mid-ocean spreading rates and thus the size of ocean basins can play large roles (e.g., [Müller et al., 2008](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1151540)), which is why for example, sea level was *extemely* high during the Cretaceous (with sea levels upwards of 100-200 meters above modern), in part reflecting *very fast* mid-ocean ridge spreading rates (and thus broadly shallower ocean basins). There are other controls on sea level as well (Figure 1 from Miller et al., 2005 is actually a nice schematic of the controls in the sense of their possible amplitudes and timescales), and all of this to say is that we *do not* expect a 1:1 correspondence between CO2 and sea level, so that's the relationship in Miller et al., 2020 is messy, is not really surprising."

AskScience,Why are ungulates classified by toe parity?,"It is because we determine things as more closely related if they share a more recent common ancestor. So orcas and moose shared a common ancestor more recently than orca and horse or moose and horse. 
DNA supports Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla (or Cetartiodactyla) as two separate groups. 
Within mammals, convergent evolution (traits that look similar but do not share a single origin), is pretty common. This makes determining relationships from morphology alone much more challenging! 
If you are interested in cetacean evolution and how they came about from the artiodacyls you could look into transitional fossils for this group. It's actually really cool (to me anyway) to see the mix of traits as the cetaceans adapted back into life in the water!"
AskScience,"As we age, why does it become harder to see in dimly lit rooms?","Your eye is like a camera. To achieve focus on any camera, you have 3 options. Option 1 is what a healthy eye normally does, which is to focus your lens to a distance of an object you wish to capture.

But as you age,  the lens in your eye loses elasticity and it's harder to change the distance to which it is focused.  In fact, this function is the first thing to go for most people - the lens' ability to stretch and compress into a desired shape is progressively lost, which is why reading becomes harder. 

This is like switching to a camera with a fixed lens, and is a main reason why surgery can't fix the loss of ability to see up close. 

But if the lens becomes fixed to a narrower set of depths, you can still use options 2 and 3.

Option 2 is to increase the distance between the camera and the object to the one that your lens is already focused at. You've seen people do this (or may have done it yourself) when you moved the thing you're reading further away.

The last thing you can do is to increase the range of depths that your fixed lens is focused on. This is done by making a tighter aperture, which reduces light scatter*, thereby increasing the depth of field.

Your eye can control this in two ways. You can squint to tighten your aperture, or you can force your pupils to reduce in size by shining more light onto an object. 

As you age, you can expect to be insinctively doing an increasing combination of all three modes of fixed-lens focusing. This is why those of us over the age of 40 buy reading glasses by the dozen - this is akin to carrying an extra fixed camera lens set to a closer focal distance.

AskScience,"If two people are infected with the same virus (or bacteria), do they produce the same antibody to defend themselves? If not, do some people produce more effective antibodies and why?","Somatic recombination in b-cells and t-cells is essentially a numbers game, leading to a variety of b-cell receptors and consequently antibodies. When one of those b-cells recognizes an epitope which belongs to a pathogen, it's pure coincidence, and only after that the clonal expansion and antibody production of this specific cell is initiated.

That's why the search for neutralizing antibodies for SARS-COV-2 still continues, because new types of neutralizing antibodies are still found in patient sera, which might be more potent in preventing severe disease. 

To answer briefly: 
The chance that two people produce the same antibody (ies) is non-zero but rather low. How effective in neutralizing an antibody is depends on a lot of things, pure chance being the most important."
AskScience,"Will water ice melt faster if allowed to drain, or remain in the meltwater?","Why not try it?

I would expect so.

Air is a poor heat conductor and so would do a bad job transferring heat into the frozen cube. 

Liquid water on the other hand is quite a good conductor of heat. 

If heat can efficiently transfer into the water, e.g. from the container the cube is sat in, I would expect this would increase the melting rate.

The water would also provide an additional surface for the heat from the air to flow into."

Each B and T cell recognizes a unique target, exactly 1 target each. The ""target"" is formally called an antigen, and antigens are simply foreign molecules. These may be found on bacteria, viruses, funguses etc.  Your body generates tens of millions of B and T cells every day, so this creates a very broad repertoire of antigens for your immune system, theoretically billions of unique ones."
AskScience,Do Little Earthquakes Prevent Big Earthquakes?,"It's important to remember that the scales we use for earthquakes (which in the US, is typically the [moment magnitude scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale), i.e. Mw) are logarithmic. Thus, let's say we define a big earthquake as an Mw 8.0 and a little earthquake as an Mw 2.0, the Mw 8.0 is 1,000,000 times larger than the Mw 2.0 (or alternatively if we say a Mw 3.0 is small, the Mw 8.0 is 100,000 larger, and so on). 

Now, this is just thinking about the magnitude as represented on a seismogram, if we want to say how many earthquakes of a given small magnitude equal a given single large magnitude earthquake, we need to consider this through the lens of radiated energy. For this purpose we can use the equation on the linked wiki page that relates Mw and radiated energy Es, specifically,

Mw = 2/3 log(Es) - 3.2

So, we can use this to calculate the amount of energy released by a single Mw 2.0 or Mw 3.0 and a Mw 8.0 earthquake and thus just how many Mw 2.0 or 3.0 events we'd need to equal the energy of a single Mw 8.0. If you go through the math, you'll find that to equal the released energy of a single Mw 8, you would need ~31 million Mw 3.0 or ~1 billion Mw 2.0 events. Let's be more generous and consider something of a more moderate event, like a Mw 5.0, but even then you'd need around 32,000 Mw 5.0 events to release the same energy as a single Mw 8.0. 

With this, you could play other games, like lets say the fault system in question has stored enough energy to generate a Mw 8.0, but you have 25 Mw 5.0 earthquakes over a given period, how much energy is left? Again, doing the math, enough to generate a Mw 7.9997 earthquake. 

Suffice to say, no, a few small quakes every year are a literal drop in the bucket toward the total strain budget of a system capable of generating a large magnitude earthquake so these do not really do much in terms of preventing an eventual large magnitude event.

EDIT: Writing this answer as I was falling asleep led to me not addressing the ""overdue"" aspect of the original question. If you would like a deeper dive on why the concept of earthquakes being ""overdue"" is incredibly problematic, I'll refer to you this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/geologic_event_overdue/)."
AskScience,What are the effects of adding rock salt to a cooler full of ice?,"Ice in equilibrium with (pure) water will stay at 0 degrees C. No higher and no lower. If you add salt to the water, the equilibrium temperature will decrease. So a brine ice mixture can be lowered below 0 degrees C. This lower temperature system would ""stay cool longer"" because it is colder.

>It's as if they're saying that by adding salt, they've removed even more energy (heat) from the mass

Melting is an endothermic process. This process will ""remove"" heat via bond breaking in the ice. So by adding salt to the water and lowering the equilibrium temperature, the system will respond by melting some of the ice. This consumes energy and lowers the temperature until equilibrium temperature is reached.

EDIT: To clarify a misconception, an observed decrease in temperature does not equate to the ""removal of energy from the system"" (when simply adding salt). A decrease in temperature can occur when there is a transfer of kinetic energy to potential (when ice melts endothermically). Regardless, in the water-ice system the temperature is not actually proportional to kinetic energy. That is only the case in an ideal gas."
AskScience,how accurate is the greenland ice core oxygen isotope study in regards to earth's climate history ?,"For the entire Earth's climate history, it is not one core from one place that will tell us everything. It's why climate catastrophe denialists keep bringing up the ""medieval warming period"" which anybody in the field knows was a local anomaly, not a global one (or you'd see it reflected in records of other places). So standalone, the Greenland ice core is quite accurate for the local climate of Greenland. In context with the various measures of our past climate, it contributes another degree of certainty to the consensus global climate, more accurately reflecting the overall global climate.   

Slight tangent but this phenomenon of local vs global is quite important when we think about other questions too, e.g. does the COVID vaccine cause heart disease (insert one statistic from one country that seems to correlate the two) - here you can ask if this is reflected in all the other countries as well, or might more related to something local (which could be as benign as how data was collected in one place)"
AskScience,Do we know why bed bugs can’t spread parasite transmitted diseases such as Lyme disease and Malaria?,"At least part of the reason is that the respective carriers for Lyme (Ixodes ticks) and malaria (Anopheles mosquitoes) are *biological* vectors - meaning that the organisms (Borrelia and plasmodium, respectively) are dependent on being able to replicate in the insect vector for transmission. No replication in the insect, no transmission - it's why Lyme disease can't be transmitted by mosquitoes, and malaria can't be transmitted by ticks.

Some diseases have mechanical vectors, where there's no replication in the insects, they serve more like a dirty needle than a host. Bedbugs could, in theory, serve as mechanical vectors for some agents.

E: I'm not exactly sure *why* bedbugs don't serve as vectors for anything (that we're aware of). They seem to have the potential. Lice, for example, can spread diseases like trench fever (Bartonella) and typhus (Rickettsia). A medical entomologist might know :)"

I had severe anaphylaxis after injected immunotherapy gone wrong, and that was for a grass allergy. I had critical asthma but not anaphylaxis like that to grass. The difference was mode of delivery. 

Comparatively most pollen/hayfever will be inhaled, with the coating of the sinuses catching most of the allergens, compared to ingested with there not being the sinus mucus protection, but there still being some limited esophageal mucus, and stomach pH as protection, and that compared to injected(IE bee stimgs) having very little primary protection at all since it is into skin and/or muscle/blood by capillary, being the most direct action."
AskScience,"Why does Haumea's spin give it an egg/football shape? Shouldn't it be a flattened sphere that's symmetrical around its axis of rotation (so an oblate spheroid just like earth, just more oblate)?","There are *two* equilibrium solutions for a rapidly spinning body: the oblate spheroid that you expect, but also the triaxial ellipsoid that Haumea assumes. The shape that an object would actually take is determined by its density and rotation rate, so that would be the direct answer to your question: because an object with the density and rotation rate of Haumea only admits a triaxial ellipsoid as stable solution.

I assume you would find this answer unsatisfactory, and ask then: why is the triaxial ellipsoid the only stable solution? I don't know, I assume the answer is complicated mathematics. I looked in the [discovery paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509401), and they don't explain it, but just cite the book ""Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium"" by Chandrasekhar to support their assertion."

AskScience,About how long would it take for an active volcano just above water to form an island (with trees and wildlife/vegetation)?,"The answer will depend a bit on the details, but we can consider a useful natural example from [Surtsey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtsey), an island off Iceland that first emerged from the ocean in 1963 and has been studied for this exact question, i.e., how does life colonize a new volcanic island. The introduction to [Sigurdsson & Magnusson, 2010](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/7/883/2010/bg-7-883-2010.pdf) provides a nice timeline of events. I'll refer interested readers to that paper (and the relevant references), but some highlights to get at a rough chronology:

* 1963 - Island first emerges, eruption continues for 3 years. 
* 1965 - First vascular plant found along the beach, while eruption is ongoing
* 1968 - First moss found
* 1970 - First lichen found
* 1971 - First fungus found
* 1986 - Gulls establish a small breeding colony
* 2003 - Population of gulls is ~300 breeding pairs, vascular plant proliferation grew in tandem with gull population
* 2008 - >60 different species of vascular plants live on the island

The main point of the Sigurdsson & Magnusson paper is the importance of the gulls (and seabirds more broadly) in the vegetation patterns, specifically by the birds providing abundant quantities of a limiting nutrient (nitrogen) that allows plant communities to flourish where the birds live. This echoes other work highlighting the importance of marine birds in vegetation development on islands, from the introduction of nutrients like at Surtsey, but also through seed delivery and dispersal (e.g., [Ellis, 2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-005-7147-y)).

In terms of delivery of other organisms (and to some extent, the original colonizing plants), birds again can play a role, but there are a variety of other mechanisms. As described in a variety of literature (e.g., [Measey et al., 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01589.x), [Garcia-Oliveras et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12961), [Santos et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018221004405) and references therein, etc.) animals and seeds/plants can be delivered to islands by ""normal"" wind dispersal, storm events, rafting (i.e., things floating there on debris, kelp mats, etc), and even by large landslides. The timescales for these processes are going to vary widely (and depend on things like proximity of the island to other, already colonized islands, or large landmasses, among other things), so it's a bit hard to pin down a single characteristic timescale for the colonization by organisms, but suffice to say, it can be pretty short in many cases."
AskScience,did dinosaurs have lips?,"This is a difficult thing to answer because typically soft tissues rot away too quickly to fossilize, and so you have to infer their existence by bone shape.

AskScience,Could a black hole just be a big neutron star that just has gravity so high light cant escape?,"To the extent our current best theory of gravity (general relativity) is accurate, it is not possible for a static extended structure to exist inside the event horizon of a black hole. Gravity there is so strong that even outgoing photons move toward the center; that's why there's an event horizon. If a static structure existed, its material would have to move outward faster than light, which is impossible.

Also:
> As the mass rises for a neutron star, it reaches a point where that mass at that diameter no longer allow light to escape the surface. 

This would happen for an idealized rigid body, but it's not really what happens to a neutron star. As the neutron star's mass rises, the repulsive interaction between neutrons is no longer able to support the star against gravity, and it collapses (see the [TOV limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_limit)). That's when the black hole forms.

(If a neutron star could maintain its structure up until the event horizon enveloped it, the maximum mass of a neutron star would be at least 4 solar masses. Instead it's 2-3 solar masses.)"
AskScience,What's the mechanism behind smog causing stroke or heart disease?,"Smog or other gases that are inhaled can enter the systemic blood stream and cause oxidative stress to the circulatory system or blood vessels. The particles causing damage to the lining of the vessels or the sacs in the lungs will initiate the inflammatory response and cause cellular mediators such as platelets & fibrin, to heal the damaged wall. This causes the vessels to narrow or form plaques overtime and can obstruct blood flow to the heart/brain. A piece of the plaque can also rip off and travel to the brain and obstruct blood flow that way as well."
AskScience,is it the case that poisonous animals tend to be colourful and if so why is it that they tend to evolve to be colourful moreso then other animals?,"The “why” comes down to evolution. Let’s do a thought experiment. There is a population of caterpillars that are poisonous. They look exactly like a non-poisonous species and both are mostly brown. Birds will try to eat both. They notice that some taste great and some taste awful. 

Which is which though? You don’t want to make the same mistake twice. There is, of course, genetic variation in coloration. Some of the poisonous caterpillars have small, thin red stripes and some don’t. The birds eat both and notice that all of the ones with red stripes taste bad but only some of the all brown ones taste bad (because some are poisonous and some are the non-poisonous species). They stop eating the striped ones but keep eating the brown ones (and spitting them out). The poisonous ones with no red stripes are thus weeded out of the gene pool and all of the poisonous offspring now only have red stripes. Over time, those red stripes get larger and larger as the caterpillars with bolder red stripes are less likely to accidentally get eaten and thus the genes for bold bright warning colors are more likely to be spread in the gene pool of poisonous animals. The opposite is true for tasty non-poisonous animals. Only those with the best adapted camouflage survive to pass their genes onto the next generation."
AskScience,How does human body convert energy to work?,"Muscles:

Your muscles are made up of giant bundles of teeny tiny fibers, one of which is ~~the same as~~ very similar to the ""micro-tubules"" (actin filaments) which cover the inside of all cells like a highway.

These fibers are strung like cables parallel to each other, with a ""lever arm"" in between them.  At rest the lever arms connect the parallel cables.  ATP breaks the chemical bond between the arm and the actin filament, and causes a new reaction in the myosin level arm which makes it contract and jerk ""forward"".  ADP releases that contraction, and the AT (the phosphate is released in the initial reaction), so the myosin lever arm clamps back down.

The whole motion pulls on the actin like a rope causing a contraction.  Check this out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrHsiHazpsw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrHsiHazpsw)

This same sort of action with one cable instead of two (generally) is a big part of how things are moved around within the cell.  ADP and ATP react with purpose built proteins to change their configurations so that mechanical motion, or chemical reactions can take place.  They aren't the only form of energy as any molecule which induces a change is releasing energy.

The ""electricity"" in the nervous system is chemical like a battery.  A negatively charged environment is maintained inside of the axon (wire) through pumps which use ATP to pump out positive ions, pump in negative, and through special pores that only allow positive ions through.

There are also special cells called glial cells which help to maintain the external environment at a specific concentration of ions.

When an action-potential (signal) is fired, the pores close to the body open up and the stored electrochemical gradient (the battery) between the outside and inside equalizes.  This sets off a chain reaction because some pores have receptors for positive ions on the inside which (provide the energy to) trigger them to open.  So the battery ""unzips"" all the way along the wire.

At the end of the line chemicals may or may not be released depending on calculations in little processors there.

Then the glial cells and the pores and pumps get to work resetting the battery with the help of ATP."
AskScience,"When pharmaceutical companies develop new prescription drugs, do they test every method of delivery to the human body? For example, injected, orally, topically, rectally, etc?","It depends on the drug. They are going to already know what delivery will likely work without further modification.

They take these into account when deciding the best way to deliver the drug.  Target organ also matters."
AskScience,What is the hardware used for quantum computing and how does it work?,"Quantum computing is currently done theoretically and experimentally on multiple kinds of hardware. Each kind of quantum computer hardware setup is called a platform for quantum computing. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses, however, the currently most popular seems to be superconducting circuits. These are what Google are posting most of their money into.

Like the electrical circuits in the computers of your life, these are made by etching or cutting the circuitry onto silica. However, unlike the computers of your regular life, these circuits need to be super cold and shielded from our noisy environment. To do this, they are cooled down to close to absolute zero and kept in a very high vacuum. This is why, if you google images of a quantum computer, you'll see lots of big, cold metal cylinders.

Other platforms of active research include trapped atoms and ions. These would look like a large metallic vacuum chamber with windows, where lasers go in. These lasers are what's used to read, write and cause computation to happen on the ions or atoms. With these kinds of computers, you'll usually see large tables full of mirrors around it for all the manipulations that need to be done to the lasers for them to cause the right computations to happen. These lasers might also be what's holding the atoms/ions, depending in implementation.

Some people are also looking at doing quantum computations in photons. This is way more niche and not as popular, because while quantum computers in general are very difficult to make and operate, currently, these would be even harder. These would probably look like a laser table setup with lots mirrors where the light could be trapped for long enough to do computations.

Some people also believe in interfacing these different quantum computing platforms to make use of their different strengths in different scenarios. This would be far into a future where more than one kind of quantum computer actually works well enough for us to want to interface another good quantum computer with it.

So basically, they usually look large, unwieldy and pretty much like a physics laboratory. Because all quantum computers are, essentially, still physics research labs."
AskScience,"Question from my 9 year old: “when we die, does our microbiome also die?”","Most of your microbiome will live and kick-starts the decomposition process. Some of it will change over time as your tissue changes after death.

AskScience,Have there been any ophiocordyceps fungi like (or any type of) creatures found infecting animals in bodies of water/oceans?,"Sacculina

AskScience,What is actually preventing our teeth from falling out?,"Collagenous connective tissue. Basically, each tooth's roots sit in corresponding sockets, and there a thin but very strong layer of fibrous connective tissue connecting the tooth root to the surrounding bone.

This is why teeth can sometimes, but not always, fall out of long-dead skulls.  Collagen is really tough stuff, and pretty decay resistant once it dries up, so if the skull is dry, the dried tissue keeps the teeth in.  But if the collagen rots, gets wet, or is eaten by something, the teeth just fall out.  Bone collecting subreddits are full of laments by people who put a skull in water and Dawn to degrease and all the teeth fell out."
AskScience,How is nuclear fission controlled in atomic weapons? What’s stopping the fission process from ongoing and continuously creating the reaction indefinitely?,">How is nuclear fission controlled in atomic weapons? 

It's not really controlled, other than the fact that you want the system to be subcritical until you're ready to produce yield, and then you want the system to become as deeply supercritical as possible when you set it off.

>What’s stopping the fission process from ongoing and continuously creating the reaction indefinitely?

The weapon physically blows itself apart, spreading the fissile material out, and making it subcritical again. (And furthermore, the fuel isn't infinite; even if you could cause every single fissile nucleus to undergo fission, it still wouldn't go forever.)"
AskScience,What physically happens to a virus when your body destroys it?,"So as your blood pumps around your body, some of the plasma seeps out of your capillaries and into the surrounding cell structure, washing away any cellular garbage like dead cells and dis-RNA’d proteins left over from the war on ~~drugs~~ diseases. This flows into the lymphatic system and is transported away to filtering and cleaning stations called lymph nodes and the waste eventually finds its way into the kidneys or intestines to be expelled along with the rest of the body’s waste."
AskScience,A medical isotope made from nuclear weapons waste (Tc-99m) has a six-hour half-life. How do hospitals keep it in stock?,"Pharmacist who used to work in a nuclear pharmacy - they don’t keep it in stock!

Logistically, it doesn’t make sense for most medical centers to have their own nuclear pharmacy, so one location will service large metropolitan areas.

AskScience,Why can you determine rotation with 0 force acting?,"> By pure definition it's not accelerated

AskScience,What would happen to a person standing on the edge of a faultline when it moves?,"The first thing to cover is that **both sides moved**, the appearance that one side moved is just a perspective / reference frame thing. The easiest way to consider this is through the concept of [elastic rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic-rebound_theory), basically the idea that the upper part of the Earth's crust behaves like an elastic material. There's a diagram on the wiki page, but others are better, like [this one](https://image2.slideserve.com/3766466/slide10-l.jpg). Referring to that, the underlying idea of elastic rebound is that if you start from an undeformed state (i.e. line A-B-C-D-E-F-G), as the two sides of a fault move, areas in the ""far field"" (e.g., spots A' and G') record the full motion, but as you approach the ""locked"" fault, there is increasingly less interseismic (i.e., between earthquake) deformation until you get to the fault (point D) where there is no deformation. This is equivalent to flexing an elastic beam that you hold parallel to yourself and you pull one side toward you and one side away from you, the center of the beam will not move. Eventually, the stored elastic strain overcomes the friction of the fault and the elastic deformation is ""recovered"" and points near the fault move to ""catch up"" with the far field deformation, by varying degrees depending on their proximity to the fault (e.g., point B' doesn't move too much, point C' moves more, and point D bifurcates into points O and P).

As to what would happen to a person on one side or the other or straddling the rupture, for sure you'd fall down. Beyond that, and barring that nothing fell on you, you didn't fall into a fissure that opened up along something like a [mole track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_trace#/media/File:Fault_trace_geq00014.jpg), you didn't end up sinking into a [liquefaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction) feature, or were damaged by the eruption of something like a [sand boil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_boil), I'm not sure you'd necessarily be injured. I'm not aware of any indication that seismic waves have ever induced air pressure waves to the point where they'd be physically damaging to a person for example."
AskScience,What specifically keeps viruses from moving from human to animal or vice versa in most cases?,"It's very crudely similar to the reason you can't get an organ transplant from your dog despite sharing the same organs. There are certain molecules (mainly proteins) that exist on the surface of animal cells that allow other species to recognise them as foreign. By and large the same *kinds* of proteins (we say they are homologous) exist on the surface of your dogs cells and yours but they are sufficiently different that your body will recognise them as ""not mine"".

Viruses exploit their hosts by binding to proteins on the surface of cells. Often these proteins are sufficiently different between species that a virus cannot recognise ""Protein X"" in a human, even though it operates by binding to the homologous 'Protein X"" in a dog. However, it is certainly possible for viruses to evolve to recognise both dog *and* human Protein X. This can happen most easily when humans and populations of sick animals live closely together for long periods of time. It's one of the leading hypotheses of the emergence of covid, HIV and ebola (to name a few high profile but far from comprehensive examples).

The viruses don't do this on purpose of course. They're mutating randomly all the time. But if a few virions by chance develop a mutation that makes them less selective wrt the differences between Protein X across species AND they have the opportunity to spread to that new species, they can jump the ""species barrier"" and become a new infectious agent in a new set of hosts."
AskScience,"If someone is born blind, is their visual cortex still active but maybe used for other tasks?","Hi, I'm a neuroscientist. Not an expert on this specific issue. 

The visual cortex is still there in blind people but it does not develop properly for vision (more below!) 

Brains are very plastic and the visual cortex gets coopted to help other senses. Resources are rarely wasted in the brain!! 

But it is no longer useful for vision after a fairly early age. Many years ago, a surgery was developed to remove congenital cataracts. This allowed some people, as adults, who had been blind from birth to be able to use their eyes for the first time. However, their brains had not properly developed to interpret visual information. So instead of the coherent visual picture that we get, it was all a gigantic mess. Objects were disjointed, things that were not moving would drift across their field division in different ways. Stuff would happen like if you were looking at someone's face, their eyes would move around and pass each other, and the nose would drift down or something. It was by and large not very successful for most people, and many of the people who had the surgery actually opted to going back to being blind.

EDIT: lots of interest in this comment which was admittedly half-assed remembering from my undergrad 20 years ago. 

Here is a modern story from India, including an 18 year old who regained sight and learned to see in time:

AskScience,How and why do diet and lifestyle changes reverse insulin resistance?,"If a muscle cell is not doing any work and is already full of glucose/glycogen it begins to down regulate the number of insulin receptors on its surface. Exercise causes muscle cells to use their glucose, creating a need for more glucose to find its way into those cells.

If your blood sugar is regularly high, all of your non-lipid cells begin to down regulate their insulin receptors, as again they don’t need the energy and apparently sugars are abundant. Lipid cells take excess glucose and convert it to fat to be released when glucose levels are low. By eating well, your blood sugar levels drop, and non-lipid cells start to up-regulate insulin receptors to ensure they have the energy they need to function."
AskScience,Is it just canaries or birds in general that are more sensitive to toxic gases?,"All birds are very sensitive to toxic fumes. 

I used to raise parrots, even the bigger macaws would drop dead, if I say for example, overheated a Teflon pan on the stove. 

Never keep a bird near any kind of toxic fume. Their respitory systems are super delicate."
AskScience,Do ligaments (ACL) build up to an injury or just suddenly fail?,"They suddenly fail. 

Simple answer is that ligaments don’t bulk up the way muscles do. And while we’ve created multiple supplements and exercises to increase muscle mass, it’s the same ligament holding bones together. A 180lb high school kid who adds 50lb of muscle in college has practically the same ACL he always did. 

ACLs typically fail with a pivot and valgus load to the knee.  That’s a twist and the knee bends in toward the other knee, usually from a force like a tackle or other hit. 

While ligaments don’t repair themselves as quickly and regularly as bone, they are living tissue so any micro trauma will typically result in repair. I haven’t read any literature on evidence showing cumulative injury to ACLs causing most injury.

AskScience,Is there any absolute dating methods for metal?,[removed]
AskScience,What happens when we die?,"First of all, there are two clinical definitions of death. The traditional definition is irreversible loss of blood circulation. The heart doesn't ""decide"" to do this, but due to some injury it can no longer pump blood. This means it can no longer deliver oxygen to the rest of the body, which means most of your organs can no longer produce sufficient energy to maintain homeostasis. Among other things, cells need to constantly use energy to pump water out of themselves. Without energy, they usually swell up and rupture. Again, this is not a ""decision"" or signal sent to the body, any more than a balloon decides to pop when punctured by a needle.

The second definition of death is ""brain death"". This means that brain cells are no longer receiving blood, and are all dying for the reasons given above. Other organs may still be receiving blood, but legally the person is still dead."
AskScience,What is happening on a microscopic and subatomic level when welding metal?,"You generally melt the two sides of the weld, and then either try to get the flow fronts to join into each other or your introduce a filler material to make up the gap. The alloys (both the ones being welded and any filler material) are designed in such a way to prevent the different heat treatment on the weld line (and nearby, known as the Heat Affected Zone). The weld schedule (speed; power used; width, depth, and temperature of melt pool; etc) is also highly alloy dependent.

Once the material has melted and been stirred together, it's allowed to cool off and then solidified back into a metal. It's at this point all the clever alloying comes into play to make sure you get the properties you want from the phases you can grow."
AskScience,"Why aren't all amniotes classified as reptiles in the current taxonomic groupings? Couldn't we have just called sauropsids ""bird-like reptiles""?","For the most part, Reptilia just isn't really used as a formal taxon anymore. It may sometimes be used as a convenient grouping of more basal or less metabolically active amniotes, but in this way it usually applied to extant or recent groups (i.e., the classic collection of lepidosauria, turtles, and crocodilians) in which case there's no need to specify the inclusion or exclusion of early synapsids. The definition of reptilia as basically synonymous with sauropsida was an attempt to sort of preserve the term as a proper monophyletic clade, but in my experience researchers mostly refer to sauropsida instead to avoid any ambiguity."
AskScience,How do rocks naturally get knto the position of balancing on another rock?,"Depending on the examples in question, there's going to be a few different options, I'll discuss two common/possible ones here.

(1) For **balanced rocks**, or as their often referred to in a paleoseismic context **precariously balanced rocks** or just PBRs, these often form *in-situ*. As described in a variety of publications (e.g., [Bell et al., 1998](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/26/6/495/206852/Dating-precariously-balanced-rocks-in-seismically), [Balco et al., 2011](http://noblegas.berkeley.edu/~balcs/pubs/BalcoRoodPurvance_PBR_2011.pdf) with most referencing the Twidale, 1982 book - *Granite Landforms* with respect to formation mechanisms for PBRs), one common way they can form is basically having a series of vaguely spheroidal shaped boulders in the subsurface defined by sets of intersecting fractures (which form via exhumation jointing, spherodial weathering, etc) surrounded by looser regolith (i.e., much more broken up rocks). As weathering and erosion continues, the looser bits get eroded away, but the boulders (i.e., the *corestones*) get left behind, and if they're stable, they'll end up staying in their stacked position as the surrounding regolith is evacuated. The Balco et al PDF has a schematic diagram to help visualize this process in their figure 2. 

(2) Another possible option are [glacial erratics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic). These are large rocks that are dropped by large ice sheets and glaciers. These were rocks that were picked up (or fell into) a large ice sheet/glacier and transported, usually significant distances, until they were dropped by the ice sheet/glacier, usually as a result of melting. Most erratics don't appear as balanced rocks (more just kind of large, random boulders, often in areas that otherwise do not have many exposed rocks), but theoretically it's possible for a glacial erratic to end up as a balanced rock.

In terms of distinguishing between the two, classic PBRs usually will all be the same rock, i.e., the individual boulders balanced on each other will be largely derived from the same original bedrock and have the same composition, etc. Also, in a given area, there will probably be several PBRs as their formation reflect the right sets of conditions and processes that allow for their formation (and thus you would likely expect it to have happened in more than one spot in that area, though not always). In contrast glacial erratics, by definition, are very different rock than the surrounding bedrock. Similarly, a stacked erratic is probably going to be just one rock high, i.e., a single glacial erratic sitting on top of the local bedrock, as the ability to form actual columns of corestones (like with in-situ formed PBRs) is not really present. Also, while you might expect to see groups of erratics in a particular area, you wouldn't necessarily expect groups of balanced erratics as an erratic ending up as a balanced rock is going to be a bit more ""by chance"" as opposed to by process like with traditional PBRs."
AskScience,Do brine pools preserve genetic material?,[removed]
AskScience,Question about T cell development and self antigen expression on thymus cells?,"Hmm I need to recheck my immunology course to tell you the details, but the T cells undergo a negative selection in the medulla and cortex of the thymus. 

Basically it eliminates thymocytes with high affinity receptors to self-MHC peptides complexes. This is necessary for self-tolerance and that the T cells don’t cause auto immune diseases. 

The elimination is based on apoptose of those cells. 
The screening for those high affinity receptors is done with proteins like AIRE (auto immune regulatory protein). Not all self-antigens are presented in the thymus, but it does indeed present a diverse array of self-antigens to educate developing T cells.

AskScience,How do prions misfold other proteins?,"The answer to your question depends on how much detail you require to be an adequate explanation, but please consider the following possible answers to your question (in increasing level of detail):

1. A prion is a misfolded protein (which you know) that also exists in a correctly folded conformation in the host. When a prion comes into contact with such proteins, it acts as a template to induce a conformation change in the host protein resulting in it assuming the misfolded conformation. These changes then progress in a catalytic like manner resulting in massive changes in conformation with a resulting toxic effect on the host.
2. In somewhat more detail, please see the link below, which provides a brief, more more detailed review of the subject (along with the effects of protein folding in other disease states). Scroll down to the middle to read the portion specific to prions.

AskScience,what is the Difference between fluid intelligence and creativity?,"Fluid intelligence is usually measured by the ability to solve problems, reason non-verbally, recognise patterns, and perform mathematics.

It doesn't directly have anything to do with 'acquiring knowledge and utilising it accordingly'. In fact it's quite the opposite because your description sounds a lot like practical abilities which is different to theoretical abilities like intelligence. It is also difficult to define what knowledge and utilisation is intelligent for a given situation. It depends on the aim of the individual.

Creativity is the ability and action of making something new.

>This means you can be intelligent without being creative

It's pretty much impossible to be intelligent without being able to create new things/ideas. Society's traditional perspective of creativity can be separated from intelligence though, implying it arises as a personality trait, but the simple definition of being able to create novel stuff is not separate to intelligence"
AskScience,Will a dead body sunburn?,"The answer is actually yes, but you won't see it.  

When the body dies, it does so in stages.  Clinical death is the cessation of circulatory function.  Even though the heart and brain have stopped, some.of the cells of the body will remain alive for a period of time.  These cells can be damaged by sunlight, and technically yes, there will be a sunburn.  Due to the lack of circulation, there won't be the telltale redness due to inflammation or blistering in more severe cases, but the underlying pathology of a sunburn can still occur within a few hours of death."

AskScience,How did viral DNA become part of the human genome?,"The life cycle of a virus goes as follows. A virus attaches to their specific host, then inject their genetic material into the host. The host then gets ""fooled"" into reading this material and making more and more viruses. Once there's so many viruses that the host can no longer perform the function to keep itself alive, it essentially explodes and releases the next generation of viruses into the world. 

Viruses can copy their DNA into their host for this purposes, but sometimes the virus is over powered or the cell survives infection and the genetic material the virus input is kept. If this happens in a gamete (sperm or egg cell) that goes on to be fertilized, that viral input is copied from the gamete to every daughter cell and voila, you have inserted viral genes into a multicellular organism."
AskScience,Why don't wireless signals interfere with each other?,"Oh, but they totally do! Boat radars, for example, are much noisier and less effective in busy harbors due to all the interference from other boat radars.

We have tools to mitigate interference problems. One of the main ones is frequency separation; two waves at two different frequencies are interfering in physical terms, but you only ""listen"" to the frequency you want, ignoring signals that are vibrating at the wrong frequency. Old radios do this by using a variable capacitor or inductor, so that the radio curcuit's resonant frequency equals that of the desired signal. Some newer systems can just ingest ALL signals and then digitally filter it in post.

Since I mentioned digital signal processing, there are other digital techniques that can be used to clean up a signal. For example, if you expect a specific type of interference, and you know what that interfering waveform will look like, you can basically subtract the interference out of the signal. Going back to boat radars, we know empirically that interference from surface waves look a certain way, and interference from rain looks a different way. You can adapt your signal processing to account for that."

AskScience,How would a scientist be able to tell the difference between a blood sample from two totally different animals?,"One way would be to simply look at the blood underneath a microscope. If you take a smear of the blood and then stain it with various dyes, blood cells would look different between different species.

The differences would be more extreme the less-related the species. For example, the red blood cells of reptiles and birds still have a nucleus and look like [oval eyes.](http://blog.vetbloom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Featured-reptile-blood.jpg) Human red cells, on the other hand, are just [red circles](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61QVTMK99vL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_FMwebp_.jpg)-- slightly lighter in the middle than the sides.

Amongst mammals the differences might be a bit more subtle. For example, you might look for a specific type of white blood cell called a eosinophil. They aren't common but if you search the slide you'll probably find one eventually. Eosinophils have a lot of large granules in them that look pretty different from [animal to animal](https://www.jacionline.org/cms/attachment/c15fd512-a090-4447-88bf-21ed0fd06077/gr1.jpg).

There are, of course, many many other ways to identify the blood. Some are much more precise than this (genotyping being the obvious one.) But a peripheral smear is low-tech, inexpensive, and I think most fun."

I understand its path would get swayed by planitary objects, but to go exactly full 360 over and over, and repeatedly pass us? Confused","Almost all of the non-star things we can see from Earth are gravitationally bound to our Sun. The other planets, the asteroids and comets, moons, etc are all part of our solar system, which means they are bound to the Sun. Most of the planets have nearly circular orbits, so they have very repeatable, normal patterns, while some of the comets and asteroids have highly elliptical orbits (spend a little bit of time close to the Sun moving fast, but spend most of their time far away from the Sun, moving slow). It's these comets with highly elliptical orbits that have these odd patterns you're mentioning. Probably the most famous comet, [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet) has a very high eccentricity (of 0.96. 1 is the max eccentricity, Earth's is 0.016), meaning it can be up to 35 AU (1 AU is the average distance from the Sun to the Earth), and down to 0.5 AU. 

What does it mean to be gravitionally bound? One way of thinking about it is that the total energy of the system (system being object orbiting and the object it's orbiting) is negative. How is it negative? Traditionally we consider gravitational potential energy to be negative- and it gets more negative the closer you get to it. Kinetic energy is positive, increasing with speed. So, if the sum of the kinetic energy + potential energy is negative, then the object is ""gravitionally bound"" to the object it's orbiting. [This is how you calculate escape velocity, and another way of saying it is that the comets are traveling at less than the escape velocity of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity)."
AskScience,When did vertebrates generally start having five fingers in each limb?,"I find this a very interesting topic.  

When fingers first show up, there are a lot of them.  Fingers originate as support bones in the fins of lobe finned fish.  There were more than five of these, and early tetrapods started off with more than five fingers.  

However, outside of _very_ early tetrapods/proto-tetrapods, finger number reduced to five and has basically never gone above it again.  Tetrapods _reduce_ finger number all the time...it's quite common to find species with four, three, two, or even one finger.  But it's nearly unheard of to find them with more than five...when a ""sixth"" digit is present it's usually a result of modifying a wrist bone rather than a true extra finger.  The exceptions are a few oddball marine reptile groups that had polydactyly in the bones making up their flippers, and various frog species with structures that may represent rudimentary extra fingers.

Which is actually really odd, since polydactyly happens as a mutation fairly regularly. It just doesn't seem to ""catch on"" very much.

But anyway, to answer your question, tetrapods had settled on five fingers by the mid-Carboniferous, and have pretty much stuck with that many (or fewer) ever since.  It's not really a matter of ""converging"" on five, though,  as it is ""sticking with the five they started out with, or losing some along the way"""
AskScience,How does extracting venom from animals help us create antidotes?,"Let's use snake venom as an example. Venom is extracted from a venomous snake and then dosed (carefully) into a mammal, often a horse or sheep. That animal develops antibodies to fight the venom. Those antibodies are harvested (from blood serum), processed, stabilized, and packaged into antivenom for humans or pets. The antibodies can be included in whole (generally more effective but high risk of allergic reaction) or just certain parts (less effective, lower allergic risk)."

AskScience,Is the H5N1 bird flu unusually zoonotic compared to other viruses?,"https://www.smh.com.au/national/bird-flu-is-spreading-among-mammals-how-worried-should-we-be-20230207-p5cig3.html

-Influenza viruses bind to certain sialic acid-containing receptors on the surface of cells, using them to get inside and take over. These receptors come in multiple varieties; human influenza viruses bind to alpha-2,6 receptors, while the viruses that infect birds prefer alpha-2,3.

This difference is important. Humans also have alpha-2,3 receptors, but they tend to be deep in the lung rather than in our upper airways. That makes it very hard for H5N1 to get a purchase, giving us good protection from the virus. The tradeoff is when it does take hold, that infection is deep in our body, often leading to severe disease. This explains why bird flu infections in humans are extremely rare but often lethal: the World Health Organisation has tracked 868 cases and 457 deaths since 2003.

...Indeed, the virus isolated from the mink in Spain had an uncommon mutation that allows it to more-easily infect mammal cells.

And it does not need to take many more steps before it is a danger to humans. Lab evidence suggests as few as five specific amino acid changes are all H5N1 needs to spread effectively in humans. Wild viruses with two of these mutations have been spotted. “It’s not really a big stretch for it to happen,” says Horwood.

Is this an imminent pandemic threat?
“No,” says Professor Ricardo Soares Magalhães, director of the Queensland Alliance for One Health Sciences at the University of Queensland, “the situation is indeed concerning, but not a matter for alarm.”

The Spanish researchers tested all the people who worked with the mink but did not turn up any evidence of H5N1, suggesting the virus has not picked up a mutation that enables easy spread to humans.

And CSIRO bird flu expert Dr Frank Wong points out there’s no evidence the virus has a new mutation that allows it to spread easily in mammals. The mink, which are jammed together in small cages, may be a special case. “The risk of onward, mammal-to-mammal transmission has not really changed,” he says. “It’s still a bird-adapted virus.”

Mauna Loa is in active shield building, where you have large volumes of silica-poor lavas with low viscosity with frequent eruptions. The eruptions occur both from the central, summit vent, and from fissures along the flanks of the mountain. Mauna Kea is currently dormant and has entered the post-shield phase. During this phase lavas become more silica rich, with higher viscosity, and usually have a higher concentration of water, CO2, and SO4 in the magma. Higher viscosity lavas with higher volatile contents are more explosive, gases the exsolve from lava as it rises cannot escape like bubbles in a pot of boiling water. They grow in the lava, becoming bigger as lava rises to the surface. This makes the lavas less dense, making them ascend faster, and eventually when lava hits the atmosphere, they explode, creating cinders.

You can also get cinder cones during active shield building, but it isn’t as common, and since there are so many lava flows happening all the time, the landscape is constantly being covered by new flows and any surface record of cinder cones are lost. Mauna Kea has not been active since 4000 years ago, though it is likely to become active again at some point in the post-shield stage.

An interesting detail about Hawaii is that there are actually two trends of volcanoes, called the Kea and Loa trends, that can be identified by rock chemistry. On the big island Kohala, Mauna Kea, and Kilauea make up the Kea trend, and Hualalai, Mauna Loa, and Loihi make up the Loa trend.

Edited to add some nots that were lost."
AskScience,Why doesn’t dark matter affect planetary motion like it affects the rotational velocity of stars at a larger scale?,"The short answer is that it pulls the Sun and the planets by the same amount, so their relative motions within the solar system can ignore what's going on outside.

The dark matter halo of the Milky Way is very big and smooth. It's a big roughly spherical blob, that's denser in the middle, and less dense on the outside. Its net effect is that it an adds extra gravitational force towards the centre of the galaxy.

But this is all just classical gravity. The weirdness is that dark matter doesn't interact electromagnetically (although neutrinos don't do that either), but it's totally normal in how it interacts with gravity. If you had a big blob of gas with the same mass and distribution as the dark matter halo, it would produce exactly the same gravitational force (although this gas halo would be unstable, and would cool and collapse, as it can interact electromagnetically). The reason dark matter makes stars and gas orbit faster than you'd otherwise expect is just because there's more mass, and more force, and this mass is more spread out than the stars (which are more heavily concentrated in the centre), which means that the force drops off less slowly with distance than it would otherwise.

So the answer for why dark matter doesn't affect the orbits of the planets in the solar system is the same as why the combined gravity of all other stars and gas and black holes and everything else in the galaxy doesn't affect the orbits of these planets, or even why the Sun doesn't affect the trajectory of a football on Earth. If the gravitational force field varies only on a much bigger scale than the system you are looking at, then it pulls all objects in that system by the same amount. This means that, from within the system, you can't really tell that you're getting pulled at all, other than by looking at the overall motion of the whole system.

There is a middle ground where you get ""tidal forces"". This is where gravity differs *a bit* across some object. So, the Moon does pull the near side of the Earth more than the far side, which pulls Earth's oceans a little bit. But this is much smaller than the net total effect of the Moon on the Earth as a whole. But the gravitational force of the galaxy is on a way bigger scale than that, and we really can just ignore it if we only care about what's going on inside the solar system."
AskScience,Can insects get food poisoning? Can an ant throwup?,[removed]
AskScience,Is the eyesight of small animals like mice and snakes as poor as ours would be if our retinas were the size of theirs?,"Better or poor are tricky descriptors. Animals evolve their senses to be suited to their environments. Humans’ colour vision is amongst the best in the world and have some of the most detailed up close vision in bright light. The trade off was poor low light vision. Other animals prioritize low light vision over perceiving colours. Humans have sharp vision in a tight area directly in front of them but the trade off is poor peripheral vision and no vision behind them. Other animals have an almost 360 degree field of view, but lack a region of extreme sharpness. Each of these different sets of abilities is “better” in a particular set of living conditions."
AskScience,"With the extraordinary amount of precipitation that has fallen on California, would that weight have any effect on the tectonic plates/fault lines and could it cause a major earthquake?","The **short answer** is probably not, but it's complicated and any potential effects depend a lot on the details (i.e., where is the water, how much water, which faults, etc). We might expect some change in the statistics of microseismicity, but the likelihood that this would influence details of large magnitude earthquake is low.

For the **longer answer**, we need to establish that changes in surface loads from water (either rain or snow) and changes in the amount of water in the shallow subsurface (i.e., groundwater) can have an influence on earthquake statistics and details. There's not a single mechanism at play here though, so things get a bit messy. Some of the culprits at play are changes in: (1) primarily vertical normal stress magnitude from changes in surface water mass, (2) changes in strain rate from longer wavelength elastic responses to changes in water mass, and (3) various ""poroelastic"" effects that relate to more or less water within pore spaces at various levels within the upper crust. 

The easiest one to wrap our heads around are the first, i.e., changes in normal stress. Basically if you have a shallowly angled fault, putting more weight on it will actually make it less likely to fail because, in a simplistic way, you're increasing the friction. For example, in portions of the Himalaya, there appears to be excess seismicity in the winter, with the idea that large loads imposed by the summer monsoons increase the normal stress on faults making them less likely to fail in the summer (e.g., [Bollinger et al., 2007](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2006GL029192), [Panda et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06371-2)). Similar things are seen in Taiwan, though the signal is a bit messy (e.g., [Hsu et al., 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abf7282)). Alternatively, in Japan, the opposite is found with some areas potentially experiencing more earthquakes in summer with the normal stress provided by snow suppressing earthquakes in the winter (e.g., [Heki, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X02011482)). Given this, we'd kind of think that heavy rains (i.e., more water mass) would actually decrease the likelihood of earthquakes, but critically, these examples are mostly focused on shallowly angled faults (i.e., shallowly dipping dip-slip faults), whereas in California, most of the faults of concern are close to vertical.

With reference to California, we've recognized that there is seasonal modulation of earthquake statistics (mostly for microseismicity, i.e., small earthquakes) thought to be related to changes in both surface and grounwater mass and related effects, i.e., those long-wavelength elastic and poroelastic ones mentioned above (e.g., [Johnson et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aak9547)). A variety of follow up work has filled in details (e.g., [Kreemer & Zaliapin, 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL079536), [Kim et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JB019560), [Carlson et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JB018490)), which highlight that the potential earthquake response depends on where the change in the water mass is in relation to specific faults and the type of faults. Heavy precipitation, depending on where it is, can make earthquakes slightly more likely for some faults and less likely for others depending on the details. Also, as discussed in some of the papers, some of these effects can have a significant (several month) time lag. Mostly again, this is considering small earthquakes and changing *statistics* not total energy release, but there are some indications that some of these water mass related changes could allow for larger earthquakes (e.g., Kreemer & Zaliapan), but this specific suggestion was for when faults in a particular location were experiencing fault normal extension due to an elastic response to *less* water.

Ultimately, what this suggests is that, especially given the large amounts of both snow and rain, this added water mass will likely influence some aspects of earthquake statistics, but the likelihood that this directly relates to a large earthquake is pretty low. Also, importantly, we don't generally understand these systems well enough to use this information to make useful or actionable forecasts for the details of changes in earthquake statistics we might expect, but I fully expect there will be papers in the coming years considering what effect these storms had on details of crustal strain and impacts of those changes in crustal strain."
AskScience,What exactly does Spaghettification mean?,"In short, it’s basically a hybrid.

From the point of view of a body experiencing it, it’s just an extreme tidal force (which is not actually a force, but the rate of change of acceleration induced by some force with respect to position). It *is* space time being stretched, and that would produce tension on an object falling into a black hole (and I think there’s also compression in directions perpendicular to that tension, as depicted in the image you shared, but I don’t recall the details off the top of my head). Early on, that tension is not sufficient to break apart molecular bonds, but eventually it is, and the object will indeed get ripped apart. Eventually that tidal force might be strong enough that molecules get ripped apart, and at some point the curvature could be enough that you have to modify the very description of fundamental particles, at which point you’re getting into questions of quantum gravity, which are beyond the scope of experiment at present, and for which there are no generally accepted theories."

AskScience,"Does no mass mean no gravity? If gravity becomes stronger the more massive the object becomes, so if there is no mass then there will be no gravity?","Answering this question correctly requires that you are very careful with your terms. In a Newtonian sense, gravity comes from mass, and is linearly proportional to it. So, with no mass, you have no gravity. But as you could probably guess, since I said ""in a Newtonian sense"" then this answer isn't fully complete. The first thing we have to understand is normally when someone says ""mass"" what they mean is ""rest mass"", and normally ""rest mass"" is what dominates any gravitational interaction. But even though it dominates, it doesn't tell the whole story. 

In general relativity, gravity is determined by the [stress-energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor) (Note: this is sometimes called the stress-energy-momentum tensor, so if you google and find a hit that calls it that, same thing). In the stess-energy tensor, there is a term labeled T00, which is the ""rest mass"" portion of the tensor, which is the Newtonian gravity term. But the other terms also contribute to the gravitational field including the [electromagnetic portions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor). And since a photon has an E and B field, even though a photon has zero rest mass, it does contribute to the gravitational field. At this point, a lot of people think ""OK, so if I want to know how the energy contributes to the gravitational field, I can just say m = E/c^(2) and then add that ""energy equivalent of mass"" to the rest mass, and get the answer. And what makes this particularly tempting to do is it does work sometimes. For instance, the gravity from the Earth is increased due to the fact that it is rotating. If you take the energy of the Earth's rotation, divide it by c^(2), and add that term to the mass of the Earth, and it does explain the extra gravitational pull from the Earth. [The gravitational mass of the Earth is increased by 10^(7) kg due to it's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence#Applications). Or perhaps even more interesting, almost the entirety of mass of a proton is due to energy. A proton is made up of three quarks, two up and 1 down. The mass of a proton is [938 MeV/c^(2)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=mass+of+proton), but the mass of the quarks that build it are only [9.1 MeV/c^(2)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=2*mass+of+up+quark+%2B+mass+of+down+quark). AKA- over 90% of the mass of the proton comes from the nuclear strong force, and you can calculate how much energy is there just by using E = mc^(2). 

But this method only works for bound energy. The rotational energy of the Earth and the nuclear strong force energy are contained in the object. Something like light passing through an area is not bound, so you can just say ""this many photons at this energy is here, thus this is how much gravity there is."" (Interesting side note though, if you put light into a perfect reflecting mirror box, and then pumped it full of a bunch of photons and let them bounce around in there, once again they would be in a bound system, so you could do it the easy way)"
AskScience,How does pyruvate know to go to the mitochondria or to do the anaerobic reaction?,"[This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4464838/) is a good review of pyruvate transport into the mitochondria. Basically, pyruvate can flow across the mitochondrial outer membrane using non-selective anion channels such as VDAC1.
There are two proteins, MPC1 and MPC2 (named for being mitochondrial pyruvate carriers), that form a complex that transports pyruvate through the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where the oxidation happens. The MPC complex carries a proton along with pyruvate (which is known as proton symport). Since pyruvate is negatively charged this means the overall transport process is charge-neutral across the inner membrane.

In general, compounds diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. Since pyruvate is consumed in the mitochondrial matrix, the concentration will be lower there, so pyruvate will diffuse inside if the proper transport proteins are present. In absence of oxygen, pyruvate won't be oxidized in the mitochondrial matrix, so this concentration gradient would be much lower (or absent entirely)."
AskScience,"At what point is an invasive species no longer considered invasive and is considered part if the local biome, or does that never happen?","European starlings have been in North America for over a hundred years. They're everywhere, but they're still considered invasive.  Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have been in North America for ~500 years, and are still considered invasive by many. 

This might be more of a history question - species may not be considered invasive if they invaded prior to our knowledge or written history."
AskScience,What do we know about post-viral effects on the body?,"There is a long and complicated history of medical neglect and denial when it comes to post-viral illnesses. Some people develop what's called myalgic encephalmyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome after an infection or other insult (toxic mold exposure, for instance). Many viral infections have been linked to ME/CFS, including influenza. This illness can be extremely debilitating, lifelong and absolutely hellish. Most standard tests come back normal, so the medical field has long dimissed the illness as anxiety or malingering.

But evidence of immune and other dysfunction in ME/CFS is overwhelming. Several years ago, then-NIH director Francis Collins launched a deep-dive study on the illness at the NIH's Clinical Center (research hospital). The study brought in a relatively small number of patients and threw dozens of tests at them. The idea was that this 'deep phenotyping' could uncover the underlying pathology of the illness.

[https://mecfs.ctss.nih.gov/](https://mecfs.ctss.nih.gov/)

The main findingsn from the study have finally gone to a journal. So I hope they will be published soon.

Part of the reason NIH launched his study is an Institute of Medicine report from 2015 that found that ME/CFS is indeed a very real post-viral illness that is woefully under-researched. Up to 2.5 million Americans qualify for the diagnosis...and this was pre-COVID.

AskScience,K-T boundary in South Dakota?,"Under normal circumstances, I'd suggest that this post is better suited for somewhere like /r/geology, but they're closed right now. I'm not personally that familiar with South Dakota geology (maybe someone else will chime in), but the first place to start is with a geologic map. This [very basic one](http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geologyofsd/geosd.html) from the SD state department of natural resources gives you a first order idea. Basically, there are *potential* (doesn't mean they're actually exposed or good) exposures of the K-T (or K-Pg as it's also known these days) anywhere the lighter green blobs (upper Cretaceous) contact the darker orange blobs (Tertriary), so that narrows the areas by a lot (e.g., basically anywhere in eastern South Dakota is out). While you're on the go, there are a lot of good phone apps that allow you to look at the geology of where you are, the two that I know of for the US are [Flyover Country](https://flyovercountry.io/) and [Rock'd](https://rockd.org/). Rock'd tends to have a lot more information and is more designed for being on the ground (as opposed to Flyover Country, where the idea is that you can figure out what you're looking at from a plane), so I'd recommend that one for this purpose. Finally, probably the most specific resources will be the [Roadside Geology](https://www.amazon.com/Roadside-Geology-South-Dakota-Gries/dp/0878423389) book for South Dakota. This is a great series that exists for most (but not all) US states that provides descriptions and directions to interesting outcrops available by car."
AskScience,"Does refracting light impart momentum onto the object that is refracting it, for the duration of the refraction?","Yes, by conservation of momentum if light is refracted in a way that's not symmetric, momentum must be imparted to the lens. It doesn't even need to be a single pulse - a prism will refract light asymmetrically, and an off-axis section of a spherical-surfaced lens will do it."
AskScience,Why are specific monkey/ape species suitable for biomedical research while others are not ?,"It's a good question! Humans as apes are more genetically similar to other apes than tailed monkeys, and that small difference (e.g. 1-2% of dna) has a huge impact on development. When animal research is carried out there is lots of preparation with model cell lines, organoids, tissue cultures, etc., before you get to the actual animal in the cage. With all that effort put into preparation, you want the final animal samples to be as close to human samples as possible.

Other simians also have different diets, microbiomes and are susceptible/resistant to different diseases than humans, which could definitely affect your immunology experiments.

However, the scientific benefits of using our closest relatives (i.e. humans, chimps and bonobos) is outweighed by the ethics of using highly intelligent and emotional organisms for research when alternatives are available. Ultimately, this is a socially constructed limitation but it's one I agree with. Also, it is very very expensive to raise great apes in captivity, which means research budgets can't cover it. Imagine raising a 60kg human with emotional problems that can bench 150kg for years just to cut it open and look at its colon. That's not worth it."

AskScience,Will an object free falling from high in the atmosphere be displaced by Earth’s rotation?,"In that scenario, the most important thing would be the spaceship's speed as it entered the atmosphere. Typically spacecraft move much faster than the rotational speed of the planet beneath them.

For example, spacecraft in low Earth orbit (like the International Space Station) move at 8 km/s (about 5 miles per second) and travel around the world every 1.5 hours. Compare that to the Earth which turns every 24 hours: the ISS is 16 times faster.

Astronauts on board the ISS see 17 sunrises and 17 sunsets every day.

If the spaceship in your story was travelling from the night side to the day side, it's entirely possible to see the sun rise in a few minutes.

The case of the Red Bull guy is very different. He didn't start in orbit — he started approximately stationary with respect to the Earth's surface, which means he was already travelling east at the same speed as the Earth was rotating. As he fell, he continued to travel east at the same speed as the surface of the Earth, so from the point of view of someone on the ground he was falling approximately straight down.

I say ""approximately straight down"" because he would have landed slightly ~~west~~ (edit: east!) of where he started due to the Coriolis effect."

A sealed n95 is going to be 95%+ effective, and wearing no mask at all will be 0% effective. So a neck gaiter is going to better than nothing, but it's not a substitute for a n95 (or even a surgical mask) in risky situations e.g. close quarters, poorly ventilated spaces (busses, bathrooms) etc. Outside, ventilation is much much better, so it probably doesn't matter as much what you wear.

AskScience,How many years did it take ecosystems to recover from K-Pg Extinction event (Chicxulub asteroid)?,"The very unsatisfying answer is that nobody really knows. There aren't a lot of fossil beds immediately on either side of the K-Pg boundary, which means we don't really know how long the overall extinction took, let alone how long the recovery was, at least not on a global scale. There are estimates for the length of the extinction ranging from a few years to over 100,000. 

Part of the problem is that you're dealing with an incredibly incomplete record. Preservation of fossils is rare, and finding them is difficult, so often researchers are trying to draw conclusions from very narrow sets of data and extrapolate it to the rest of the ecosystem.

It's also very difficult to narrow things down in geology/palaeontology to less than a few thousand years, so any numbers you find that are more precise than that aren't going to be based on actual data collected from the rocks. There's the convenient Iridium layer that generally lets you know which side of the K-Pg boundary you're on, but beyond that the most precise rock dates you can probably find would be +/-10,000 years. 

So yeah. Any numbers you can get out of this are probably going to be large ranges, possibly overlapping each other."
AskScience,Shouldn't goldilocks zones shift over time?,"Yes, different stars are different sizes and output different amounts of radiation, light, heat, and gravitational pull. All of these things affect the planets and celestial bodies around them. And stars in their final days balloon outwards as they expend the last hydrogen inside of them. This also shifts the Goldilocks zone outward. 

So yes."

AskScience,I've scoured the internet and can't get even close to a single answer. Through what mechanism do long distance ocean waves group themselves together?,"Wave grouping has to do with '[soliton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton)' effect.  

In most wave propagating media, such as ocean surface, propagation speed depends on wavelength.  A single 'hump' in water surface can be represented as a summation of waves of different wavelengths/frequencies, but since each component wavelength travels at different speed (called dispersion relation), typically short wavelength components slower, the hump profile dissipates over time (broad base travels ahead of sharp peak), and you no longer have a hump at some point.

However, if the amplitude of the hump is sufficiently large, it can affect this dispersion relation (sometimes referred to as non-linear effect because equation has a term with amplitude to power greater than 1).  Amplitude-dependent propagation speed can locally make short wavelength components to keep up with long wavelength components.

So when multiple waves interfere, you can get a large and sharp enough amplitude around the peak, which will locally affect dispersion relation, and this soliton can preserve its profile as it propagates.  This looks like multiple waves merging to form a single (or a few) waves."
AskScience,"Why does it seem earthquake ""feel"" has a directionality to it sometimes?","There are two relevant considerations:

**1. Earthquakes do have directionality.** In *extremely oversimplified terms*, you can think about an earthquake as like a portion of a fault progressively slipping, where the slipped area (i.e., the rupture) increases in size through time. Many ruptures also have a strong directional bias, i.e., it starts on part of a fault and moves along the fault plane mostly in one general direction as opposed to equally in all directions. You can very clearly see this in many earthquake simulations, [like this one of a M7.8 on the southern San Andreas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blTx92TuWHA). If you're ""upwind"" of the direction the earthquake is propagating, shaking will tend to be more intense than being downwind. Other details you can see from this simulation, when we report locations of earthquakes, we report the location of the epicenter, which is the projection to the surface of *where the earthquake started*, not necessarily where it had the most shaking (see also this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/epicenters/) about what epicenters do and do not represent and why we use them). Finally, what you can also see is that subtle changes in the geometry of the fault can dramatically change the way earthquake waves propagate along and near it such that locations that are relatively close to each other can experience *very different* amounts of shaking. To elaborate further on that point and add some additional considerations...

**2. Rock properties vary.** Shaking at the surface, both in terms of intensity and duration, depend in part on the rock properties of a given site, the geometry of the area surrounding the site, and the properties of the rocks that the seismic waves propagated through before getting to that site. Even if we imagine a completely uniform distribution of seismic waves (i.e., ignoring the directionality details from above), depending on what those seismic waves go through, different areas (at equivalent distances) can experience different shaking. This can be generalized as [seismic site effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects), e.g., seismic waves traveling through a sedimentary basin can effectively reverberate and increase shaking. Differences in attenuation (i.e., how much energy is lost as a function of distance) can also play a big role. Seismic waves traveling through very fractured rock attenuate a lot whereas seismic waves traveling through more intact rock attenuate less. This is why in the US, earthquakes of equivalent magnitudes are much more widely felt in the eastern US (where rocks are broadly more intact) than in the western US (where rocks are broadly more fractured)."
AskScience,"When making an epigenetic change to DNA, how do RNA and the chemicals/enzymes used for it “know” which genes to target?","Effector proteins, transcription factors, DNA binding proteins and other regulatory proteins and RNAs will have different binding affinities towards segments of DNA. If say the DNA is methylated at a certain regulatory site the structure of that region of DNA and nucleosomoes will have a higher chemical binding affinity for a repressor protein which then Cascades a signal or physically prevents RNA polymerase from reading the DNA. Absence of the repressive epigenetic signal can increase the binding of activating enzymes etc to turn genes on.

Chemical signals can come from many places and a lot of signals start with a chemical effector binding to a protein and caused a phosphorylation cascade that reaches the nucleus to turn on/off activators and repressors to then target DNA binding sites."
AskScience,"By le chatlier's principle, if hair bleaching is an exothermic reaction, why do hair salons use heat lamps to ""speed up"" the process?","Temperature affects both the rate of a reaction and the equilibrium point. Higher temperatures frequently increase the rate of a reaction regardless of what side of the equilibrium the system is on. So long as the rise in temperature doesn’t cross the equilibrium point of the system you’re likely to get an overall speed up with higher temperature in an exothermic reaction.

A similar trade off with le chateliers principle happens in the Haber process, which is an industrial reaction used to make ammonia. The reaction itself is exothermic, but the Haber process goes faster at higher temperatures due to the increased rate of energetic molecular interactions."
AskScience,Is there a limit to the number of sounds you can hear simultaneously?,"Yes, your ears can’t hear quieter sounds that are near the frequency of a loud sound. And some frequencies cancel out higher frequency sounds as well.  This is the reason that lossy audio compression works. You can throw away all noise outside of you ability to hear. It is a significant amount of data that can be tossed.

In addition audio is collected at a certain bit rate (8 bit, 16 but, 32 bit, 96 bit). As well as at a certain sample rate (44khz, etc).  Modern audio cards can sample audio well above your ears ability to distinguish the individual changes or frequencies.  

We often use this to our advantage when capturing audio.  For example capturing at 96 bits is similar to modern HDR cameras in that you can capture both the quietest and loudest sounds we can detect, at the same time, even if both together would never be in the same final mix. This lets us set and forget our mic gains without worrying about blowing out the sound."
AskScience,Do lymphocytes always have 46 chromosomes?,"This is a great question. 

B and T lymphocytes are unique in vertebrates because they’re designed to physically chop out and re-link chunks of their chromosomes, as part of the development of antibodies and T cell receptors ([V(D)J recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination) in Wikipedia). A super simplified sketch 

Original chromosome:

—-A—————-B—————

Rearranged chromosome:

—-A-B—————

This is driven by [Recombination-activating genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination-activating_gene), which look for specific DNA sequences (“A” and “B” in my ludicrously simplified sketch above), cut the chromosome at those signals, and re-attach the broken ends. 

So far, so good. But evolution is stupid, and this process happens simultaneously on multiple chromosomes, because antibodies and TcR have multiple chains and those chains are encoded on different chromosomes. 

So what’s supposed to happen is:

Antibody heavy chain, chromosome 1: 
—-A—————-B—————    >    —-A-B—————

Antibody light chain, chromosome 2:  —-a—————-b—————    >    —-a-b—————

The question is, Why doesn’t RAG hop across the chromosomes and do this:

—-A—————-B—————    \    —-A-b—————

—-a—————-b—————    /    —-a-B—————

Or some other weird combinations that would lead to splicing, chopping, and/or discarding chromosomes?

The answer is (1) RAG needs to see a particular chromosome loop structure that’s formed when the single chromosome is being spliced ([Chromosomal Loop Domains Direct the Recombination of Antigen Receptor Genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4660266/), but (2) RAG fucks up *all the time* and that’s one reason lymphomas are such a common tumor (though chromosomal translocations are not the only reason for this).

AskScience,How did the Rocky Mountains form?,"We need to distinguish between two distinct events, 1) the most recent orogenic (i.e., mountain building event resultant from convergence and crustal shortening) versus 2) when they experienced a separate period of uplift that generated their modern topographic form (i.e., so called epi-orogenic uplift, i.e., uplift without orogeny).

For the first, the Rocky Mountains as we know them today (i.e., we're going to largely avoid the complication of discussing the ""Ancestral Rocky Mountains"") originally formed as part of the Laramide orogeny (e.g., [Dickinson et al., 1988](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/100/7/1023/182160/Paleogeographic-and-paleotectonic-setting-of), [Kellogg et al., 2004](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/899/chapter-abstract/4633200/The-Colorado-Front-Range-Anatomy-of-a-Laramide)). The [Laramide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laramide_orogeny) is a classic example of ""thick-skinned"" deformation, i.e., deformation on high-angle, large-scale thrusts that cut nearly the entire crust. Both the deformation style of the Laramide (the Rocky Mountains included) and the fact that it occurred so far inland is thought to related to a period of ""flat-slab subduction"" (e.g., [Dickinson & Snyder, 1978](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/159/chapter-abstract/3790986/Plate-tectonics-of-the-Laramide-orogeny), [Bird, 1988](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.239.4847.1501)). In other words, the angle of the subducting slab (though note, this was not the Pacific Plate, this was the [Farallon Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farallon_Plate) being subducted beneath western North America) shallowed significantly. The causation of this flat-slab subduction is usually linked to the subduction of an [oceanic plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_plateau) (e.g., [Livacaari et al., 1981](https://www.nature.com/articles/289276a0), [Liu & Currie, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195115005594)), though other mechanisms have been proposed. As a note, the Laramide uplift (and its association with flat-slab subduction) is used as an analogue to understand similar styles of deformation seen in the Andes, also where flat-slab segments exist and similar ""basement-cored uplifts"" are also present. Now, some of the details of the modern Rockies likely relate to the fact that many of the rocks had experienced prior deformation events, like the orogeny associated with Ancestral Rocky Mountains (e.g., [Kluth & Coney, 1981](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/9/1/10/195706/Plate-tectonics-of-the-Ancestral-Rocky-Mountains)), but the flat-slab episode is broadly considered to be the dominant driving force behind their original formation.

While the Laramide orogeny is when the modern Rockies first formed, it's not the reason they're a high elevation mountain range today. Specifically, it's been long known that they have experienced a younger phase of surface uplift long after the orogeny (i.e., the convergent deformation) ceased, i.e., epi-orogenic uplift (e.g., [McMillan et al., 2006](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/118/3-4/393/125290/History-and-causes-of-post-Laramide-relief-in-the), [Karlstrom et al., 2012](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/lithosphere/article/4/1/3/145610/Mantle-driven-dynamic-uplift-of-the-Rocky), [Abbott et al., 2022](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/18/4/1223/613637/Post-Laramide-Eocene-epeirogeny-in-central)). If you look through those, you'll see that most of the explanations for this center on some sort of mantle driven mechanism, e.g., dynamic topography from some sort of mantle upwelling or isostatic response to a ""mantle drip"", though alternative mechanisms have been proposed, e.g., a climatic trigger (e.g., [Molnar & England, 1990](https://www.nature.com/articles/346029a0)). In general, the exact causes of this later epi-orogenic uplift phase are not as well understood as the Laramide uplift phase (though uncertainties exist within that story as well).

**TL;DR** With specific reference with the options in your question, the Rockies as we think of them today originally formed as a result of the subducting Farallon slab shallowing and driving deformation significantly further into the North American continent. In detail, some of the geologic details were likely influenced by a long history of prior deformation (i.e., the Ancestral Rocky Mountains), but their position is more tied to the development of flat-slab subduction. The final complication is that their modern topography is more associated with uplift that happened millions of years after the end of the Laramide orogeny and which is probably related to something going on in the mantle, though it remains a point of active research."

AskScience,How does smell work on a molecular level?,"Up until *very recently*, I think your chemistry teacher would have been correct. However, in March of 2023, we got [our first look at an odor molecule bonding with an odor receptor](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00439-w), at the molecular level...so now, at least for *this one odor*, we know how smell works.

The researchers created a 3d image of the [OR51E2 receptor bonding with propionate](https://analyticalscience.wiley.com/do/10.1002/was.0002057017/), which contributes to the smell of Swiss cheese. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they were able to see the propionate bonding tightly with the receptor. 

This bonding was consistent with [the docking theory of olfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_theory_of_olfaction), the leading smell hypothesis since the '50s, which proposed that odor molecules have distinct shapes which would uniquely fit into matching shaped receptors in the nose. And that is exactly what researchers saw: propionate molecules fit snugly within the OR51E2 receptor, and the act of ""docking"" caused a physical shape change in the receptor...which signals the cell to signal the nerve to signal the brain.

While it's unlikely that every smell receptor couples as tightly as propionate and OR51E2, at least now researchers have a tool they can use to begin documenting other physical interactions between odor ligands and their matching receptors."
AskScience,What role does vasopressin play in parental behaviour in humans?,"It’s not exactly wrong to think about it in terms of “X chemical causes Y behavior”, but it leads you down a conceptual path that excludes the concepts of balancing and cooperation that is critical in all things neurobehavioral, certainly among animals and even more so in humans. A similar misconception has unfortunately remained ubiquitous regarding testosterone, particularly in men. Testosterone really cannot be directly linked to particular behaviors (though disruptions in synthesis or SHBG expression can certainly suppress some realms of behavior), but rather to the abstract landscape that these behaviors travel through as we express them. As Sapolsky likes to half-humorously say, if you picked out the Buddhist monk with the most testosterone, he’s not going to be the horniest and most debaucherous monk, but rather the most selfless and ascetic one in the bunch, or at least the one striving for those most potently. In other words, the androgens (in the context of neurobiology, so including DHT and aldosterone) generally intensify and provide direction for existing behaviors generated from other perceptive and neurobiological sources.

Oxytocin and vasopressin combine in a variety of contexts to produce a very wide range of social behavior in humans, and often the same mixture will produce different impulses based on the perceived environment, one classical example being similar OTR activation trends in maternal bonding and sexual behavior, but with very different (stronger) contribution from prolactin in the former, and very little in the latter. Vasopressin will also cooperate with oxytocin at the vasopressin receptor V1ar, and the dynamics of this cooperation are heavily contextualize by perception. So, it’s more holistic to say that certain cooperative patterns of vaso and oxy underly the specific behavior seen in mothers (and fathers!) during infant bonding, rather than to try and force vasopressin into a one-dimensional knob that increases and decreases some behavior, and you’ll find this is true of most pathways in neurobiology.

Sue Carter at the Kinsey Institute would be the go-to for more reading on this topic. The neurobiology of oxy and vaso in the context of familial bonding is basically her field.

Also remember that humans are animals too. To quote Sapolsky again, human neurobiology can basically be summed up as grabbing stuff off the shelves of the mammalian neurobiology Home Depot and innovating new and more complex ways to use them as tools for socializing, and certainly vasopressin is a great example of this.

AskScience,How Does Rain Shadow Work in Cold Climates?,"There are a few requirements for generating a strong rainshadow. [Galewsky, 2009](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2008JF001085) provides a nice overview. In summary, if you have a dominant wind direction of sufficient average velocity oriented perpendicular to the average orientation of a mountain range with sufficient relief (difference in height between the crest and the lowlands), then a rain shadow can develop. This can be expressed with a simple equation *Nh/U* where *h* is the relief, *U* is the average wind velocity, and *N* is [Brunt-Vaisala frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunt%E2%80%93V%C3%A4is%C3%A4l%C3%A4_frequency). If *Nh/U* is greater than 1, you'd expect a rain shadow to develop, whereas if it's much less than 1, you won't get a rainshadow, which could reflect that either the windspeed is too great, the relief is insufficient, or the Brunt-Vaisala frequency is too low (or some combination thereof). In terms of your hypothetical, this would suggest you want the relief of your mountain range to be sufficient to generate an ""orographic barrier"", where empirical results suggest that relief of ~1.5 km is sufficient for this purpose (e.g., [Bookhagen & Strecker, 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL032011)), but this is not necessarily thinking about variations in *N* or *U* from above. Of these, the parameter we'd expect to vary with temperature is *N* as differences in this will reflect differences in [potential temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_temperature), so broadly we'd expect potential temperature to be positively related with average temperature (i.e., lower average temperature will mean lower potential temperature), but Galewsky discusses that even for values of *N* assuming an average temperature of below freezing, you still can get conditions where *Nh/U* is greater than 1 (and thus a rain shadow can develop), it will just depend on the other relevant details. 

If we assume a climate and relief where (1) conditions exist to generate a rain shadow and (2) where those conditions dictate that most precipitation will fall as snow, this does has some important effects as this implies that the precipitation can be carried further ""downstream"" (i.e., higher and deeper) into the range than rainfall (e.g., [Anders et al., 2008](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/36/6/479/29774/Influence-of-precipitation-phase-on-the-form-of)). If we consider examples of locations with either modern or past conditions of relatively cold climates (i.e., a lot of precipitation will fall as snow) and rain shadows, another prominent effect is that the windward side will tend to develop glaciers whereas the leeward side will have much more limited glacial activity. Good natural examples of this are the Olympic Mountains, Patagonian Andes, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. 


Finally, most natural examples and experiments considering the development of rain shadows considers linear ranges (though Galewsky, 2009 does briefly consider a circular, volcano like range). In your hypothetical of a ""ring"" mountain range, presumably one side would be facing the predominant wind direction, so this side would have the most extreme contrast between a clear windward and lee side. You would broadly expect that the sides of the ""ring"" parallel to the wind dominant direction to have a precipitation gradient both parallel to the wind direction (i.e., it decreases in the direction of the wind) and perpendicular (i.e., it would be dryer on the inside of the ring than the outside). An example of a precipitation gradient along a (linear) mountain that's roughly parallel to the wind direction is the Greater Caucasus, where this also is reflected in a gradient in the amount of glacial activity with more where it is wet and less where it is dry (e.g., [Forte et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16303004)). One unknown for your hypothetical would be depending on the size of the ring and other details, whether you'd expect to get some sort of development of weather systems within the basin. I think you'd have to try to model this to really answer that question."

There’s a widely believed myth that viruses inevitably evolve to reduced virulence over time. In spite of the great confidence with which this is claimed, it is not true, there are many counterexamples, and there are 60 years worth of observation of theory (with math) demonstrating why it’s not true. 

>	For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — there is evidence that virulence has increased through time … Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts.

>Theory therefore tells us that natural selection can increase or decrease pathogen virulence, depending on the particular combination between host, virus and environment

This is a 2018 paper studying amniotic fluid. It found that in the pregnancies tested, amniotic fluid was effectively sterile (no real detectable microbes).

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10869-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10869-7)

Here is a Nature (big deal journal) paper from this year supporting the sterile womb hypothesis, finding no detectable microbiome in the amniotic fluid.

*However,*

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26823997/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26823997/)

This 2016 paper found that nonpregnant uteruses had a microbiome in the endometrium.

Thus, the human uterus isn't sterile normally, but during pregnancy, the amniotic sac/fluid are sterile (where the unborn baby is)."
AskScience,How do young members of pack predators know they're old enough to join on a hunt?,"Many pack animals have a 'stay at home' phase and then a 'stay with the pack' phase. When they begin to stay with the pack if ambush is needed instinct or prior play/practice will keep them down, they may attempt to join in on the chase but chances are they will just fall behind harmlessly while they are young. As they get older, stronger, faster they stay in the chase longer and progressively learn to chase, then to attack, and finally to kill."
AskScience,"Would radiation be ""pitch-shifted"" (like the Doppler Effect) if it were to hit you while you were going incredibly fast, say half the speed of light?","If you're traveling relative to the radiation source (or vice versa, depending on how you look at it) then yes, electromagnetic radiation will be blue shifted if you're approaching the source and redshifted if you're moving away from the source.

That kind of shift is (I believe) the first evidence we had of the expansion of the universe.

If you're asking about other kind of radiation, like alpha and beta particles, I have if the relative velocity has any impact on how they're perceived.  I mean an electron is an electron, regardless of velocity, as far as I know."
AskScience,Do social animals have more viruses than solitary ones?,"In epidemiology, there is an idea of [critical community size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_community_size), where a virus circulating in a small community becomes extinct because all the potential hosts have developed strong herd immunity. Once you exceed the critical community size, however, population dynamics are complex enough that there will always be some individuals without immunity (because they are too young to have been exposed), and the pathogen circulates in different parts of the community at different times, leading to continuous cycles of infection. The same thing occurs for animal hosts, but it's important to keep in mind that animals can exchange pathogens with each other, and more generalist viruses (like flu for example) are relatively good at crossing species barriers. 

There's a number of other, related factors to consider as well, such as the dilution effect in disease ecology, whereby biodiversity actually limits the spread of pathogens presumably because of reduced community size of susceptible hosts when compared to ecosystems with low biodiversity."
AskScience,Would person with AIDS need to take immunosupressants for transplated organs?,">Would person with AIDS need to take immunosupressants for transplated organs?

Well, it's complicated. 

First of all, AIDS is the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The HIV virus (human immunodeficiency virus) will, if untreated, eventually result in AIDS. People with AIDS are at very high risk for all sorts of infections, and if the HIV doesn't get treated, and if prophylactic antibiotics are not used, then they will ultimately die, often from infection, cancer, or both. 

So if you have AIDS (as opposed to being HIV positive without immunodeficiency), you are at very high risk for serious problems, and you would not be a candidate for any kind of elective surgery, and certainly not a major surgery like an organ transplantation. 

Until recently, even having HIV was generally a contraindication to getting an organ transplant. Because people with HIV have shorter lifespans, and because of the need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications, it was not thought that it was either a good use of limited resources, plus there is a risk that immunosuppressive medications could strongly interfere with HIV treatment.

Recently, some transplant centers have begun organ  transplantation in HIV-positive patients. But we don't know whether this is going to result in longer lives for HIV-positive patients, as there could be worsening of HIV and the development of AIDS.

Now to specifically answer your question: no one really knows what to do in a situation like an HIV-positive patient with an organ transplant who develops AIDS. It's a no-win situation, and the person might well develop serious infections, organ rejection, or both."
AskScience,How have we not run out of metal yet?,"Iron is super common in the earth's crust, it's made of a whopping 5% of it.  One reason is because it's the ""lowest energy"" element, meaning it is the heaviest element that still releases energy when created through nuclear fusion.  So the stars that earth is made of created a lot of iron through nuclear fusion.

I'm more amazed we didn't run out of platinum for all those catalytic converters.  All the platinum in the world ever mined would fit in a single garage.  I guess those cats only need a thin coating."
AskScience,"Why does some spicy food have a delay, whereas with others the heat can be felt immediately?","Depends on the fat content and oils, aswell as what the rest of the dish consists of and also the fruit itself. Fats and oils can coat your tongue and be a sort of shield. Capsaicin doesnt dissolve well in water, but there are proteins that break it down. Milk for example has proteins that can break down capsaicin, and it has fats. This is why dairy helps and water doesn't when needing to cool down your mouth from spicy food. This is why you want to flush it down with something that also breaks it down, because if you you water for example, you're not really doing much other than spreading it around, where it will continue to linger until the enzymes in your saliva as broken them down or you have eaten enough other food to have taken some of it down with it. 
 So in short to your question, water content, oil and fat content, what you have previously eaten, what you choose to eat/drink after, the types of enzymes in what you're eating and your saliva. If you already have oil in your mouth from something else, the spice might feel delayed because of it working as a protective shield. If you're... goin in dry so to speak, you're more likely to feel the spice much more quickly."
AskScience,Is it possible for relative velocity to exceed the speed of light?,"Whenever asking or answering a question about relativistic speeds, you always have to include one last piece of information- from who's perspective?

So, let's say there's two people on rocket ships, Alice and Bob, and Eve is on a planet watching them. If, as measured by Eve, Alice and Bob both accelerate to 55% the speed of light and fly right at each other, then as measured by Eve, Alice and Bob will have a closing velocity of 110% of the speed of light. And that's OK. Eve is measuring two objects, both are moving less than 'c' and everything is fine.

But what does Alice see? Well, let's skip the acceleration portion, and get to the point were Alice and Bob have finished accelerating (special relativity with accelerating reference frames is really hard). In this frame, Alice is ""stationary"" (she's not accelerating, so it's an inertial frame), then Alice will see Bob moving towards her at [0.844c](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=velocity+addition+0.55c+%2B+0.55c&assumption=%7B%22FS%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%7B%22VelocityAdditionRelativistic%22%2C+%22V%22%7D%7D&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22VelocityAdditionRelativistic%22%2C+%22u%22%7D+-%3E%220.55+c%22&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22VelocityAdditionRelativistic%22%2C+%22vprime%22%7D+-%3E%220.55+c%22). Now, some people will say ""it's because in special relativity velocities don't add and you have to use the [velocity addition formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula)"" but I find that answer to be a little unsatisfying. While it's true, the velocity addition formula is what you use to solve it, where does it come from?

It comes from the facts of [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) and it's for some reason less popular cousin of [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction). Time contraction says Eve will see Alice's clocks running slowly (Alice will of course see her clocks running at just the right speed), and length contraction (which is just as fundamental, but doesn't seem talked about as much), says Eve will measure further distances between objects than Alice will. So, both of these things will lead to Alice measuring a slower velocity for Bob, and if you combine both of these effects, you will end up with the velocity addition formula."
AskScience,Why did only 1g of the Hiroshima bomb go through fission?,"You misunderstood the factoid: a substantial amount of the nuclear fuel went through fission, but only about 1 gram of the fuel’s mass was converted to energy according to E = m c^2 .

Using that equivalence between mass and energy, the 13 kiloton yield of the Hiroshima bomb is equivalent to [about a gram](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%2813+kilotons+tnt%29+%2F+%28speed+of+light%29%5E2) of lost mass.

In a typical nuclear fission reaction, uranium atoms are split, and the product nuclei are more tightly bound than the original uranium.  The difference in binding energy is released into the outside world — that’s the energy of the bomb — and so the daughter nuclei weigh slightly less than the parent.  But only slightly less: all of the particles still exist, only a tiny fraction of the mass of the uranium was lost, even though a good fraction of the atoms of uranium were split.

/u/RobusEtCeleritas points out that these early bombs were inefficient, and that’s true (which is why I was vague about how much “a good fraction” is above).  But the specific value of “1 gram” in OP’s question only makes sense if the video was talking about [mass-energy defect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy)."
AskScience,Was the universe uniform prior to expansion?,"No. There are *extremely small* [quantum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) in density/temperature, which were enhanced during/by inflation. Basically, there is very small randomness due to quantum mechanics, and the density distribution during inflation was essentially 'frozen in.'

Side note because the terminology is confusion, there are two separate similar terms: **expansion** and **inflation**. Colloquially they have similar meanings, but in the context of cosmology they are different.

* Expansion just refers to, well, expansion. We can measure it in various ways, and by fitting data to models have a pretty good idea of the expansion rate going back to just after inflation ended.
* [Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) is a period of extremely rapid expansion just after the Big Bang.  In a fraction of a second (much shorter than any timescale we can measure) the Universe multiplied in scale many times. This was initially devised as a mechanism to resolve several issues unexplained by the standard cosmological model, including the fact that the early Universe (even after inflation) is very uniform -- this is referred to as the 'horizon problem'. There are some observables predicted that we can use to test inflationary theories, but they are tough and current results are inconclusive."
AskScience,What is the meaning of the Planck mass?,"As [initially defined by Planck in 1899](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/93034#page/538/mode/1up) on the last two pages of a paper he wrote attempting (and failing) to fully explain the behavior of [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), the actual intent behind the [Planck units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units) of measurement is not to define ""the smallest meaningful measure of X."" At the time, it was pretty much just a nifty little thing that Planck realized he could do with some of the constants used in his formulas.

Keep in mind that in 1899, the definition of a second would still have been based on the length of a day on Earth. The kilogram and meter were defined by physical prototypes made of metal, but their original definitions stemmed from the density of water and the size of the Earth, respectively. The Celsius was defined by the behavior of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure.

In [the paragraphs immediately preceding](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/93034#page/537/mode/1up) the actual formulas that define the units (the section titled ""26. Naturliche Maasseinheiten""), Planck basically says ""the units we use today are all arbitrarily derived from natural phenomena on this specific planet, so they're not truly 'universal' units of measure. But hey, I could use some of the constants used earlier in my paper to create a new set of units that *are* universal!""

So, as written in that 1899 paper, the Planck units are little more than an academic exercise in creating arbitrary units of measure (length, mass, time, temperature) that are mathematically defined using only some [universal constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant). In the case of the Planck units used today (which are actually different than the units initially proposed by Planck - see the note under ""reduced Planck constant""), those constants are:

* the [speed of light in a vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light), *c*
* the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant), *G*
   * Planck uses the symbol *f* in his paper
* the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant#Reduced_Planck_constant), ℏ
   * In the 1899 paper, Planck uses the regular Planck constant (*h*, but in the paper Planck calls it *b*) and not the **reduced** Planck constant (which is equal to the Planck constant divided by 2π), so [all of the units he proposes in that paper are actually sqrt(2π) bigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#History_and_definition) (or about 2.5x bigger) than the Planck units used today. The OG definition of the Planck mass was actually 55.6 micrograms.
* the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant), *kB*
   * That should be a subscripted B, but I can't get that to work on Reddit
   * As far as I can tell, the constant called ""*a*"" in Planck's paper isn't actually the Boltzmann constant *per se*, but something like *h*/*kB*

Also, [the equations used to define the Planck units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#History_and_definition) make it so that the value of all of those universal constants is 1 if expressed in terms of Planck units. As a practical matter, if you're doing a lot of calculations or writing formulas that involve a lot of the 4 universal constants that define the Planck units (such as in particle physics), if you use Planck units instead of, say, SI units, you can just omit all of those constants, because then they all have a value of 1.

* Side note: The Planck units are one of several systems of [natural units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units) that all do similar things, in that they use various combinations of universal constants to derive their own arbitrary units of measure, where, again, whichever constants that were used to derive the units of measure will all be 1 if expressed in those units of measure.

Ultimately, any discoveries about the ""significance"" or ""meaning"" of any of the Planck units appear to be one or more of:

1. things that were discovered *after* Planck proposed those units (theories of physics have come quite a long way since 1899, after all)
2. things that are derived from the properties or meanings of the constants themselves
3. pop-sci misunderstandings of the ""meanings"" of these units of measure posited in scientific papers (though I definitely don't know advanced physics well enough to weigh in on that)

It's also worth noting that Planck's original definitions of the Planck units predates a *ton* of modern physics, such as the realization that electromagnetic radiation is quantized (1905), the theory of general relativity (1915), the concept of a Schwarzschild radius (1916), and all the subsequent work through the 1960s and 1970s to show that black holes were a real thing and not just a mathematical quirk of the formulas of general relativity - it's not like Planck had black holes in mind when coming up with these units.

**tl;dr** the current-day Planck mass is 21.76 micrograms because that just happened to be the number you get when you take the square root of ℏ*c*/*G* to get a unit of measure for mass. Maybe someone discovers later that 21.76 micrograms has some fundamental physical meaning as we continue to refine our theories of physics, but that meaning is not baked into the definition of a Planck mass."
AskScience,How long have trees been on the planet?,"The oldest tree fossils we have are about 385 million years old. But those trees have mixed traits, transitional between two of the three basic groups of trees (or any vascular plants) we have today: the tree-sized ferns (which reproduce by spores, not seeds, and can get up to 60 or 70 feet tall) and the gymnosperms (which produce seeds in cones, not flowers). There must have been plain ordinary tree ferns before that transition to gymnosperms began, but we don't know how long before, and we have no earlier fossils.

When the average English-speaker sees a tree fern or the simplest & oldest group of gymnosperms (cycads), (s)he probably normally thinks ""palm tree"", because tree ferns and cycads have the same overall form as palms: a single blocky or spikey trunk with little or no branching and a cluster of very large leaves/fronds at the top. For dozens of millions of years, that was the only form trees came in. The form that most people think of when they hear the word ""tree"", with copious branching and then branching again & again, down to lots & lots of twigs with much smaller leaves on them, which can shade the ground and cover the ground with fallen leaves, doesn't appear until about 320-300 million years ago, in the pine phylum (pines, cedars, spruces, cypresses, junipers, larches, firs, Douglas-firs, hemlocks, redwoods, and yews). Ginkgoes and angiosperms (including palm trees) would follow even later.

Before even the tree ferns & cycads, up to about 470 million years ago, there was something else that you probably wouldn't think of as a tree, but it was the biggest & tallest living thing at the time, and it was stuck to the ground, not an animal: Prototaxites. (The ""-es"" at the end is its own separate syllable.) It had the internal structure of a fungus but also some chemical hints of the presence of algae, so it's apparently either a giant fungus or a giant lichen (symbiosis of alga & fungus). Its overall shape was usually just a simple leafless column, up to 29 feet tall, although a few specimens are branched with up to 4 or 5 tips apiece. The fossils give us no sign of exactly what was on the tips."
AskScience,Does regularly taking aspirin reduce its effectiveness to reduce pain?,"No. There is no significant ""tolerance"" built for pain medication such as aspirin, acetaminophen(tylenol), or anitinflammatories. Especially not on a biophysical level the way opioid medications develop tolerance.

 If you feel the effect of aspirin is reduced over time, it's more likely that 1) your pain is worse or 2) you use it often enough you are no longer ""impressed"" by the same level of pain relief"
AskScience,"Is there a term for lake bottoms that ""hour glass"" (temporarily becomes wider following a ""shelf"" as the depth increases ) , how do bathymetric maps depict this, and does this have a common affect on turbidity, thermoclines, or other characters?","I don’t know any specific term. A lake like you describe is a rare thing. They might occur in karst terrain, but the size of any such lakes are fairly small. The largest cenotes (flooded sinkholes) are a few hundred metres across and won’t necessarily have a below the waterline undercut."
AskScience,"When a military helicopter fires thousands of rounds while hovering still, does the operator have to slow the rotor to compensate for weight loss?","You don't really slow the rotor, changing its speed would  likely bring other problems as well. You change the pitch of the blades instead, for the same effect but in a more controllable fashion with quicker response than changing RPM.

As for doing that to compensate for weight reduction while firing, I suspect it is irrelevant because they're actively steering the aircraft all the time anyway and the weight difference isn't that great. Plus it would usually be bad tactics to shoot while absolutely motionless, you'd be an easy target if hovering."
