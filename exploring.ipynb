For instance, McDonald's once revealed that they add a hint of sugar to their fries to create a more appealing flavor profile.\\n\\nIn the tech industry, it has been alleged that some companies intentionally design products to have planned obsolescence. This means that their products are designed to have a limited lifespan, encouraging customers to upgrade or purchase new versions. However, it's worth noting that not all companies engage in this practice, and many products have genuine technical limitations.\\n\\nRemember, these secrets may not be universally true or representative of every company's practices.
