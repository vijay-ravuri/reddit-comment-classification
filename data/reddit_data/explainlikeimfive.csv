explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - ADHD brains are said to be constantly searching for dopamine - aren't all brains craving dopamine? What's the difference?,"Less ELI5, but might be interesting: 
 
Neurotransmitters don't have a single function. There are things called neural pathways, and each neurotransmitter does different things in each pathway. The most notable pathway to be affected by ADHD is the reward pathway. It goes through lots of parts of the brain, including memory, capacity to make decisions, capacity to plan.   
This pathway makes sure that if we do something good,we feel pleasure. That pleasure is then stored with the memory of the action, associated. When we try to make a decision, our brain brings back memories of things that brought us pleasure, meaning we remember things that worked, and prepares (primes) us to feel that satisfaction again.   
  
When you have ADHD, your brain doesn't keep enough dopamine floating in that particular pathway, which means you don't feel satisfaction when doing things that would normally be rewarding. That lack of satisfaction is stored, marking the memory as unimportant. When you try to plan for something, you don't have experiences to draw on at first.  
  
That is why ADHD causes executive disfunction, in the form of memory issues and complications with decision making.  
  
And, of course it means that while you are doing something, your brain doesn't show you that it is an worthwhile action. That means you have to fight to stay focused, as your body tells you shouldn't. And when you do hit on a loop of reward, your brain goes ""THIS MATTERS! DON'T STOP!"". and breaking free to pay attention to something else becomes almost impossible.    
    
ADHD is really interesting! If a big pain in the ass to have.   
  
Edit: *Please* keep in mind that I'm *not a doctor*. I'm taking some classes on the topic for an *education* minor, nothing to do with mental health. I'm also Autistic, so my own experience might be different from yours. Do not take my word for gospel, but only as a way to guide your own research in the future, and a way to ask good questions from your doctor.   
  
If you want a good *entry level* overview on ADHD, Dr Tracey Marks has some good information on her Youtube channel on the topic. **entry level** being the important part.

explainlikeimfive,eli5: How does siri hear me say “hey siri” if it isn’t constantly listening to my conversations or me speaking?,"Lets try a more ELI5 attempt.

Imagine you are sleeping and the only thing that can wake you up is your alarm clock. There might be people in the same room talking. You hear them but you don't wake up and your brain does not register what they are saying.

Then, suddenly your alarm rings. You wake up and now, despite the fact the other people talk just like they did before you can hear them and know what they are talking about.

&#x200B;

Siri works on a similar principle. It has 2 cores: a small specialised one that acts like an alarm clock and a more complex one that can actually ""understand"" you. The alarm clock doesn't understand anything except ""hey siri"" at which point it rings the alarm and wakes up the complex core."

* **Slotted** ""Flathead"" - simplest of all designs. Does not work well with a screw gun, but hand tools are fine and it looks good on decorative items like electrical outlet covers.
* **Phillips** ""cross"" - works well with a screw gun. Tends to ""cam out"" when max torque is reached. Can be a curse of a feature.
* **Robertsons** ""square"" - much better grab. Won't cam out as easy. Careful not to snap your screw!
* **Torx** ""star"" - even better grab. Can be used at many angles. Again, make sure not to drive so hard that you start snapping screws.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If Teflon is the ultimate non-stick material, why is it not used for toilet bowls, oven shelves, and other things we regularly have to clean?","Funny story… was a at a friend’s for the weekend and Sunday morning I took a shower in their seldom used guest bathroom. 

Mid-shower I lost all traction and began flailing my arms around like a tasered octopus to try and stabilize my self. I wound up falling down into the tub taking the shower curtain and rod with me. 

My buddy heard the commotion and came to check up on me. I told him I was okay, just fell. 

I stood back up and a moment later the same thing happened, flailing octopus arms and all. 

He came running back this time  and we just laughed at the absurdity of it all. 

I finished by staying down and taking a bath to finish washing off. 

When his wife came home, we all had a good laugh and she grabbed the bottle she used to clean the guest bathroom and looked at it. 

It was “BrandName With Teflon”

They have since discontinued that specific cleaner."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do French words like “cul-de-sac” and “hors d'oeuvres“ end up part of the English language without being translated to English words?,"Cul-de-sac means “bag bottom” in French. As you can see, it looks and sounds much better untranslated. Especially when you are trying to sell houses.

“Hors d’oeuvres” similarly sounds more posh than “appetizers” or “starters”, and translates as something like “outside the main course”, which would be clumsy.

That said, there are such things as calques, which are words and expressions loaned from other languages and translated literally. Often you wouldn’t recognize them as such. English calques from French include “that goes without saying”, “point of view”, “flea market”, “by heart” and many other things.

Edit: Also Tolkien translated “cul-de-sac” as “Bag End” for his book, as a kind of an inside joke for philologists."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 : How's it that just 400 cables under the ocean provides all the internet to entire world and who actually owns and manages these cables,"Well the original transoceanic telegraph cables were laid by the telegraph companies. Then later the phone companies. These used good old fashioned copper wires (originally just one or two) in a LOT of shielding, and then later simple repeaters or amplifiers (and the power to drive those). 

Later on the cables switched from using copper conductors to fiber optic cables - the nice thing about fibre is you can shove multiple different color wavelengths of light down the same cable, so you can ""multiplex"" hundreds of different signals simultaneously. And with the right electronics to encode/decode and multiplex these light signals _very fast_ you get a single fiber optic strand carrying tens of gigabits per second of data. Now run _multiple_ fiber optic strands in the same cable == lots of bits / second. 

Who runs and maintains them? The equipment, ships and personnel to make and lay and splice these cables across the ocean are ridiculously expensive - so there are only a few companies who specialize in doing this. These companies are contracted by the companies who want (and are willing to pay for) the cables. THOSE companies might be telco's or governments or a consortium of telcos willing to ""split"" the cost. Big data companies too - Google is laying cables now. 

But, to over simplify, you want a data cable from New York to Paris (or the closest beaches to)? You go to the cable making co and the switching gear maker and say ""I want x channels over y fibres at z data rate"" and they tell you what equipment they can make and what the cable will look like (how thick, how much can it bend, how frequent the repeaters have to be, what the max length of spool they can make - you can't get a cable to go all the way, they have to make several and splice them together). Then you go to your cable laying company, give deets on the cable and they say yay or nay. Then you go and buy your landing points - literally where the cable comes ashore and connects to ground infrastructure. There's gonna be a shack or a bunker with gear etc. and all the interconnects with your land infrastructure. 

Then you fork over gobs of money, all the stuff gets made, the ship rolls up the spools of cable and they start at one side and start laying cable, splicing the segments together.

edit: then, once your cable is connected up how do you make money on it (unless you're going to utilize all of its bandwidth yourself, like Google)? Well, you connect up your cable ends with switches and routers that connect to other lines for various other big telcos and you start charging them for bandwidth - you just saved them the $hassle$ of laying or contracting their own cable to get more bandwidth from A to B - they run a line to your ocean cable terminus, hook up the gear and you charge them by the Terrabyte. Or whatever, $10M/month."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: When surgeons perform a ""36 hour operation"" what exactly are they doing?","Neurosurgeon here.

About 1-3 hours of that time is taken to get the patient under general anesthesia. This may involve placing monitors for blood pressure management and big catheters for blood transfusions and administering drugs. The patient has to be put to sleep and the breathing tube placed. At the end of the surgery the patient has to wake up from the drugs and the breathing tube taken out (if this is planned).

A significant portion of the time is then spent after making the incision(s) dissecting down to the area of interest for the surgery. This may involve various different teams. For example if we were removing a tumor from the thoracic spinal cord this may involve cardiothoracic surgeons to help us get into the chest to get in front of the spine. Getting good exposure to the site of surgery is as important as the ability to do the surgery itself. 

Once the area of interest is exposed the delicate part of the surgery might take place. If we are taking out a tumor from a delicate area of the brain or near the spinal cord, just chipping away at the tumor and taking small blood vessels to cut blood flow to the tumor may take 12 hours itself.

Now this is the part where complications may happen intraoperatively that if not addressed right then and there can cause serious issues. Sometimes a significant amount of time can be spent correcting these iatrogenically caused issues. These are where all the “routine” complications that are common with the surgery can be addressed. For example if we are doing spine surgery and we unintentionally cut into the covering over the spinal cord (the dura) then it may add hours to try to repair the tear under the microscope.

After part of the surgery sometimes the surgeon wants some interval imaging to see where they are at with the goals of surgery. The incision may temporarily be closed and the patient might go to an MRI to see if there is any residual tumor (if it is a brain tumor) or perhaps an angiogram procedure to see if the vascular lesion is all gone (if say we were clipping multiple aneurysm). Afterwards the patient might return to the operating room for final closure. Maybe this could take an hour or two.

If there is more work to be done it is possible you may need to do 12 more hours of work to get the last piece of tumor out or ligate the blood vessels you have to go complete the surgery. Maybe after this the surgeon might elect to go get ANOTHER MRI or angiogram to confirm that they are truly done with the goals they intended to achieve. It is possible that they send a piece of the tumor to the pathologists so they can freeze it and section it and get the diagnosis back to the surgeon so they can decide whether they need to respect the entire tumor or if they can leave some behind. This may take up to an hour.

Next is the closure of the surgical site. Depending on how deep they are inside the body this could take hours. If another type of surgeon helped expose the surgical site, often they come back in to surgery to help close the site.

At the end of the surgery, depending on what type of surgery it is and what the expected recovery of the patient is, it is possible the patient may get other surgeries done during the same general anesthesia session. For example if we take a huge tumor out of the brainstem area and we expect the patient to have significant swallowing issues due to disruption of the nerves that control swallowing, maybe they will need a stomach tube (gastric tube) to be fed through a tube in the future, or even a tracheostomy (breathing tube) so that they can recover postoperatively. This can take 4+ hours.

All in all this can add up to 36 hours but it is truly rare to go that long (at least in neurosurgery). If you are going to do that we usually like to stage the surgery over two different surgical episodes. For example if you have a giant tumor in your spine and you need the tumor removed from the spine from the front and screws and rods placed from the back you might do the back part on the first day, let the patient recover a little bit and then take them back for the front part.

And yeah the surgeons have breaks. The residents will go for breaks while the attending operates and vice versa. Multiple attendings will give each other breaks. The anesthesiologists will switch out multiple times. The longest surgery I’ve been in lasted around 36 hours. As a resident in that surgery I watched the metro train which is outside the OR window go by at least a hundred times."

explainlikeimfive,eli5 what do people mean when they say billionaires dont get taxed,"Billionaires don't get that rich with normal salaries. They get that rich because of appreciation in asset values. But asset growth (or capital gains) are only taxed when they sell. And capital gains tax rates are lower than most income tax brackets.

They may sell a tiny portion of their wealth to cover living expenses and pay taxes on that, but it's a tiny portion of their wealth. Say somebody's worth $1B and sells $10m in stock to fund their lifestyle. They pay 20% tax, or $2m, which is nothing relative to their net worth.

But billionaires don't even really need to sell, as they can typically get lines of credit that allow them to borrow at crazy low interest rates, while their assets keep appreciating in value. Someday they may sell assets to cover their loans and pay taxes, but they may wait for advantageous tax law changes, or may just keep rolling debt until they die and let their estate settle up on the debts and taxes."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How do chickens have the spare resources to lay a nutrient rich egg EVERY DAY?,"I have my own chickens. To lay eggs at that rate, which they do, requires a lot of eating.

Their store-bought food is also heavily fortified with calcium and I dry and crush the shells of eggs I’ve used and toss them on the ground for the chickens to eat. Corn, although they do like it, is not a good food. Even cracked or softened, it doesn’t have the nutrients they need.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If I do (for example) 10 squats 5 times over the space of the day, is that just as good as going 50 squats once a day? Why or why not?",One point that hasn’t been mentioned is that you don’t use all your muscle fibers on your first squat. Only as some muscle cells tire are others recruited. The idea of doing a set with an appropriate weight is to tire as much of the muscle as possible in one set. If you only do 10 squats (at a weight that you could do 50) you won’t end up working all your muscle fibers.
explainlikeimfive,eli5 How did humans survive in bitter cold conditions before modern times.. I'm thinking like Native Americans in the Dakota's and such.,"There's a lot of bits and pieces to a whole answer. Here are some.

* Furs have already been mentioned. But skins like deer hide are extremely important too. They really cut the wind, and are super flexible as well. Perfect for clothes like mittens or waterproof boots.
* Humans were **tough**. They got used to extreme cold. They stayed inside when it was brutal and lived off of stores, and only went outside when it was not. And they knew to expect it, and to be prepared for it, unlike us who just assume the electric grid will come back on soon if it goes out. When the wallopin' storm happens, we're caught unawares. A huge part of their year was PREPARING for it.
* Firewood, properly dried and preserved, makes a LOT of heat when you burn it in a small dwelling that's windproof. Get a fireplace built with a lot of rocks (for thermal mass) and a good draw (to move smoke outside), have a few cords of collected firewood that's close, and it'll be warm for a long time.
* You can avoid a lot of blistering cold by living in forest as opposed to in the open. A stand of trees will cut a phenomenal amount of wind. We don't see that as much now because few houses don't have lawns or open areas around them, but a forest walk on all but the windiest of days is actually quite calm.
* Snow piled up around the outside of a dwelling makes for incredible levels of insulation. It could be -30 in the air, but below the surface of a snowdrift, it's still much closer to freezing temperature.
* They never had electricity or modern conveniences, so they never worried about losing those. Their food was preserved as jerky or dried fruit, and their meats were either frozen in a far-above-ground shelter, or smoked and kept in a ""root cellar"". It was outage-proof.
* They ate every part of the animals they harvested. They were super good at extracting calories from stuff, so very little got wasted. Compare that to how much food we throw out.
* We use stuff like fibreglass and styrofoam and caulking. They used stuff like moss and mud and pitch (the incredibly sticky sap from pine trees) to block drafts and make warm housing. They were super clever about it.
* Way more people lived in a ""house"", and with WAY less space than we get. There were very few 'seniors-living-alone', and those are usually the ones who die first in a brutal cold snap because there's nobody to share body heat with (and body heat's actually pretty amazing as a heat source). And if you got a 10x10 foot room to yourself, you were friggin' royalty.

There's a lot more odds and ends, and this is just a starting list.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how the rank “colonel” is pronounced “kernel” despite having any R’s? Is there history with this word that transcends its spelling?,"I always liked how Bill Bryson put it in *The Mother Tongue*:

>*Colonel* is perhaps the classic example of this orthographic waywardness. The word comes from the old French *coronelle*, which the French adapted from the Italian *colonello* (from which we get *colonnade*).

explainlikeimfive,eli5 Why are glass bottles not used more for soft drinks if plastic is such a nightmare for the planet?,"I work in the industry, and at our plant, the cheapest overall option is cans, second cheapest is PET bottles, and on a very distant third, glass. I don't expect other companies to have reached significantly different conclusions than we have. 

Cans cost more per liter of beverage than plastic bottles, but can be stacked denser than plastic bottles, which means more drink per truck, more drink per forklift, and of course takes up less storage space in our warehouses. This makes them come out on top overall vs plastic. Plastic is of course more sturdy, and many customers like resealable containers.

Glass is less sturdy than plastic, holds way less beverage per pallet, and weighs significantly more. This means we would need to drive more trucks, and that each truck would be more heavily loaded. 

These factors lead to much higher emissions, which are also bad for the environment, and this is before we even start including the energy costs of producing glass bottles. Even if you reuse them , which often isn't the case, a glass bottle would need to be refilled dozens of times before it saves energy vs making ultra cheap alu cans or pet bottles. If the glass bottle gets too worn out, chipped, or smashed to bits in a forklift accident (this happens pretty often) before its been reused that many times, it's a net loss"
explainlikeimfive,"eli5, why do deer run at the slightest sound or movement, but just stand there and stare when a car is coming towards them at full speed?","One thing that others haven't mentioned: prey animals like deer and squirrels and zebras escape predators by being nimble, not fast.  They can't outrun hawks and wolves and lions in the wild, so their defense mechanism is to stand still as the predator comes towards them, and then to abruptly change direction at the last second and run off.  With any luck, the predator's momentum will cause them to overshoot the deer, forcing the predator to stop, turn around, and restart the pursuit, giving the deer time to escape.

That works great when you have a predator who is tracking you and trying to intercept where you are.  It works poorly when your ""predator"" is a huge car headed in a straight line roughly towards where you are.  The car isn't adjusting its course to hit you, so it's not going to be fooled if you change direction at the last second."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How can Ethernet cables that have been around forever transmit the data necessary for 4K 60htz video but we need new HDMI 2.1 cables to carry the same amount of data?,"The video data streamed over the internet is compressed.

The video data sent to the screen over HDMI is raw data. The video processor uncompressed the data from the internet and then renders each frame and sends the whole image for every frame to the monitor.

It's like if you get a new piece of furniture from Amazon. It will come in a box that is easy to move but you can't use it. Then you unpack and assemble it in the living room and then move it into the bedroom. It's much harder to move the assembled piece, but you need to do it in the living room because you need the space. The assembled furniture definitely wouldn't fit in the delivery truck.

explainlikeimfive,eli5 what was the point of the skull and bones pirate flag? why would you give away that you are a pirate?,"Typically, the pirates wouldn't fly that flag all of the time - they'd put up a false flag (Spain, England, France, etc.) until they were within firing range, then they'd hoist their pirate flag and fire a warning shot.  The goal here was to intimidate - the sailors on the other ship had plenty to be afraid of, especially if the flag belonged to a famous pirate. And they'd know that if they surrendered, gave up their cargo,  potentially got pressed into service or had their ship taken over, they might just get out alive.  If they resisted, there would be no quarter.  In that case, raising the black flag might save the pirates a fight for their prize.

There are also stories of pirate ships flying a red flag - this would mean no quarter given at all - which would be insanely terrifying to see coming towards you in the sea.

EDIT: Whoa, this got some attention.  Since I'm getting a lot of the same questions, I'll answer a few of the most common:

1. *What does ""no quarter mean?""*  Offering quarter means taking prisoners, impressing them into piracy (which wasn't all that bad a gig, all things considered) or releasing the enemy after taking their loot.  ""No quarter"" means ""we're here to kill you, no prisoners taken.""
2. *Wouldn't a red flag be a bad strategic move, that would result in the other ship being more likely to fight back?*  Nobody ever claimed pirates were great tacticians, but they were often psychopaths!  Other commenters have raised other possibilities in here, from pure intimidation tactics, to ""we'll offer no quarter only *if* you fight, so if your captain's telling you to fight, you might want to throw him overboard and pick a new captain quick.
3. *How did they know that a flag belonged to a famous pirate?*  The skull and crossbones that we all picture is sort of a modern, Hollywood thing.  Every pirate had their own, custom flag, or had several throughout their career.

However, some countries send vastly more mail than they receive, which is unfair to the receiving country -- they have to process all the incoming mail but received none of the revenue.

So there is an international agreement where between country pairs, the country that sent more mail has to compensate the receiving country by a specified amount.   This is called [terminal dues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union#Terminal_dues).

For example, due to e-commerce China currently send much more mail to the US than the opposite flow, so China Post has to pay terminal dues to the US Postal Service.

So 2 times faster makes the time 1/2 what it was. 5 times faster, you'd get there in 1/5th the time. 1.25 times faster can be expressed as 5/4 times faster, and you get there in 4/5th the time, or 80%."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What exactly happened with Game Stop's stocks a few months ago?,"Best analogy I've ever heard was one that used Pokemon cards. Went something like this:

Say we have a few people interested in buying and selling rare Pokemon cards. For the sake of the analogy, let's say that all of these cards are perfectly identical, and are indestructible, so they are all in the same exact condition. So there is no reason why you'd ever want one card over another if they're both copies of the same card. None of these cards are one-of-a-kind. They're rare, there's not a whole lot of them, but there's only so many. Almost always less of them than there are people who would like to own them. So they fetch a pretty price on eBay.

As people buy and sell these cards, their prices go up and down. If on one day, a lot of people woke up and suddenly decided they wanted a fancy holographic Charizard card, and they all logged on to eBay to discover that only three people were selling, those sellers could take advantage of the high demand and raise the prices to make more money. Then, later on another day, say some collector decided it was time to sell their collection. So they dump a box of a hundred holographic Charizard cards onto eBay all at once. But only 20 people are willing to buy one at the price it used to be at. Now that collector has 80 cards they want to be rid of, but no one is buying them, so they have to lower the sell price to entice more people to buy. Point being, the price can swing up and down for a lot of reasons.

Say you're a person who doesn't really care about owning the cards. You just want to make money. If you're smart, you can play this market and try to ride the ups and downs in a way where you profit. The most straightforward way is the classic and intuitive, ""Buy low, sell high"" strategy. If you think the price of a card will go up in value soon, you buy some while the price is still low. You hang on to them until the price is higher, and then you sell them back off, pocketing the difference. That's pretty straightforward to understand.

But there's also a way to make money when the value goes *down*, surprisingly. This is what ""shorting"" is. To do this, instead of buying a card, you go to someone who already owns one. You ask them, ""Hey, can I *borrow* this from you for a little bit? I'll give it back in two weeks."" If they trust you, they'll probably say, ""Sure."" and give it to you. You then go onto the open market and sell it for whatever it was worth that day. Then, you wait two weeks, hoping the price will drop.  Once the two weeks are up, you buy a new card back from the open market, and give it back to the person you borrowed it from. Remember, in this analogy all cards are completely 100% identical, so your friend doesn't care that you did this, all they care about is that you bring back the card like you promised. If in that 2 weeks time, the card's value fell, then you would have sold it off high, an bought it back when it was low. It's still the ""buy low, sell high"" strategy, but you did it in reverse order this time, and thus you were able to profit from the value going down instead of up. (**EDIT:** And to make it worth the while of the person you borrowed from, you give them a piece of the profit you made. Or you give them a flat fee.)

Just like the standard ""buy low, sell high"" strategy, there is a risk involved here. If you bought a card hoping its value goes up, but it actually goes down, you lose money. Similarly, if you try to short sell a card, hoping its price will go down, but it actually goes up, you will also lose money. But there's two caveats here that make the short selling route a lot, lot riskier:

1. When you predict wrong on a card's value going up, you still have the card. You can just hunker down and wait as long as you need for the card's value to actually go up. This is what makes long-term investments like retirement accounts mostly low-risk investments, as they can wait out bad spells. With the short selling strategy, though, you are bound to a promised a time and date where you have to return that borrowed card. If you don't, it could be catastrophic legal trouble for you. So if you predict the value will go down, and it doesn't, and you hit that deadline of your agreement, it's tough nuts for you. You gotta buy that card back no matter what it happens to cost at that point.
2. If you buy a card hoping its value will go up, and it doesn't, the absolute worst case scenario is that the card becomes completely valueless. The most you will ever be out is how much you paid to buy the card. With a short sell, though, there is no limit to how much a card can go up in value while you're in the middle of borrowing it. It could double in value. Triple in value. Go up 10x in value. Go up 1000x in value. You could potentially lose out on many orders of magnitude the original value of the card you initially sold off when you're forced to buy it back.

So, that's short-selling. Just replace Pokemon cards with stocks. What does this have to do with GameStop?

Game Stop is a store that many business investors looked and and saw it as struggling. On the brink of totally failing. So a lot of people with loads of money and loads of connections were trying to short sell its stocks, because they were betting Game Stop's value would go down soon, by a lot. That is, they went to people who had Game Stop stock, asked if they could borrow it, and sold them to other people, expecting that they could buy those borrowed stocks back later after the prices fell. They were doing this so hard that they were even on *multiple layers* of short selling -- a stock would be borrowed, sold off, and then it would be borrowed again from the person who bought it, and sold a second time. They were all-in to make bank on Game Stop prices crashing.

One pesky wrinkle, though. What if Game Stop's stock prices *didn't* fall? What if they went *up*? Well, then you'd have a bunch of investors scared shitless that they might actually lose money, so they will all scramble to buy the stocks back before the losses pile up. But that mad scramble of everyone trying to buy, buy, buy just makes the stock price go up faster, because they'll all be fighting to buy and no one is selling. This was made an order of magnitude worse by the borrowing-within-borrowing they were doing, which created the really awkward situation of there being literally more investors trying to buy back the stock than there were stocks in existence.

All it took was a spark to cause this to occur. Some clever Redditors noticed the situation and decided to kick a hornet's nest. They got together, bought several of Game Stop's stocks, which caused the price to go up. This spooked some of the investors, ~~who bought some of their stocks back to try and minimize the damage, which only made the stock price go up more, which spooked more investors, which caused more panic, which made the price go up, and, well...~~ **EDIT:** This didn't actually happen, see below.

This is what a ""short squeeze"" is. When someone in the market notices that a stock is shorted way beyond what it safe to do so, and they touch off the powder keg to cause a stock's price to skyrocket. You're squeezing the people who were trying to short the stock between a rock and a hard place and forcing them to absolutely hemorrhage money, like you were squeezing water out of a soaked sponge.

While the dumpster fire raged, the initial Redditors who touched it off were clutching onto the stocks they bought, refusing to sell at all costs. They would use the term ""diamond hands"" to refer to the fortitude it took to not sell the stocks they bought under any circumstance, to clutch onto them tightly like unbreakable hands made of diamond, the hardest natural material on earth. They wanted to watch the investors burn in the bed they've made for themselves, damn the consequences. Holding onto those stocks and refusing to sell only made the stocks rarer, exacerbating the fiasco.

**EDIT:** Might be too little too late at this point, but some updates to this story from the comments below:

It seems that the squeeze itself hasn't actually occurred... *yet*? Even long after the press has left the scene, this is still an unfolding story. Those deadlines that were supposed to cause the stockholders to lose untold amounts of money have, on paper, supposedly passed, but those clever investors aren't in the big leagues for no reason. They seem to be using all sorts of loopholes and deference tactics to hold the line, in addition to getting bailouts from big partners to stay shored up. I can't speak to what any of these tactics are in specific, that's admittedly out of the scope of what I know about this event. But for anyone wanting to know what those cheeky Redditors are up to and how they made off with all this, the answer seems to be that those diamond hands are still holding on. It's a game of chicken to see who will back down first.

**EDIT 2:** At least the above is what some people claim. Apparently this is all some real conspiracy-laden shit. I don't know what to believe, and if this comment is your only education on the matter, don't take my word for it. And tread carefully around anyone down below who tries to tell you about it."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why does it hurt your ears and make that ""wahwahwahwah"" sound when only one window in a car is down and you're moving fast? And why does it disappear instantly when another window is rolled down?","Having one window open is letting air without letting it back out, which pressurizes the cabin.  The pulsing of it is because the air is under uneven force from the eddies created around the vehicle, so the pressure is yo-yoing around and pulling on easily moved things like your eardrum in the process.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does diabetes cause a toe or foot to be lost?,"Physician here. Some of these posts are near the target, but not completely. Basically chronic high blood sugar causes non enzymatic glycosylation of arteries. That’s a big fancy word that means that sugar at high levels can damage your arteries, even very small ones that supply nerves. If those tiny arteries to nerves get too damaged, then blood (and thus oxygen) cannot get to the nerves and the nerves die. If nerves die, then you can’t feel your feet or toes as well which makes you more susceptible to bumping them on things and causing injuries/cuts. When you get a cut though, now your body can’t heal it as well because the tiny arteries that would normally bring cells, nutrients etc are also damaged. So the repairing things in your body can’t be delivered where they need to be, so then those tiny cuts become big cuts or ulcers. Those ulcers get infected with bacteria, say from a shoe. Your body still can’t heal it because the arteries are so damaged. The ulcer gets deeper. The bone in your foot is now infected. You can die from that. Foot has to go."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do some women die when giving birth? What is modern medicine doing to prevent that?,"A baby’s head is too big for the hole it needs to come out of. This makes it harder for the baby to come out safely because it needs to be in exactly the right position - a bit like a (meaty) shape sorter. Otherwise, the baby can get stuck, and that can lead to extreme tiredness and stress (the mother’s body working too hard), which can kill both the mother and the baby, or bleeding, which can also kill the mother or the baby. 

Even if the baby does manage to come out exactly right, there’s a second bit called the placenta which also has to be born. It’s like a big, slippery, veiny frisbee that attaches to the baby’s belly button and feeds the baby while it’s in its mother’s tummy. Sometimes, the placenta doesn’t come out properly - a bit of it can get left behind. This can lead to bleeding - which can kill the mother - or to infection, which can also kill the mother. Infection is when germs get into your body and make you ill. If an infection gets REALLY bad, you can die. 

Talking of infection: the womb (the space in a woman’s body where a baby grows) is like a big, open wound just after a baby’s born - so there’s a lot of space for germs to grow in and make the mother very ill. Again, if she gets ill enough, she can die.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is duck meat red meat and can be consumed medium rare and chicken meat white meat which should be cooked thoroughly even though they're both birds?,"Ducks are regarded as red meat in culinary tradition because the breast meat is darker in color. This is thanks to higher levels of myoglobin in their breast muscles. Both should be cooked to the same internal temperature in the thickest part to eliminate most food borne pathogens. That’s 165 ºF / 74 ºC. The appearance and texture will be different due to the difference in myoglobin and fat content. The higher fat content in duck meat makes it juicier and more moist compared to chicken. The higher myoglobin content will make it look more like what we associate with medium rare from steaks.  

The chance of chickens carrying food borne pathogens like Salmonella is higher than that of ducks because of how chickens are farmed compared to ducks. Much more extensively and in more crowded conditions. That means the meat has a higher chance of being contaminated when the bird is slaughtered.  

*Bonus ELI5: Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein similar to haemoglobin. It’s predominantly found in muscle cells and serves as a short-term store of oxygen. Birds that fly long distances would have lots of these in the breast muscles to help supply the oxygen needed for flight.*

Sharks constantly lose and regrow teeth, and we know megalodon had big ones, yet we don't find any teeth younger than like three and a half million years old. We don't see whales with bite marks and scars that would match those of a megalodon. In fact, the fact that we see large whales at all may be more evidence that megalodon is indeed extinct.

A slightly trickier question, though, is how do we know that one second is the same length as every other second? Maybe if there was an 'outside perspective' of time, one minute could last *this* long, and another minute could last *thiiiiiiiiiiis* long, but they feel the same length to us because one of them was squished together with us inside of it. Each one of them contains a minute's worth of 'stuff', but just because they *feel* the same length to us, how do we know they actually *are* from some external and objective reality?

Weirdly, this isn't as crazy as it sounds. [*Time dilation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) is an effect of relativity, in which -- from an ELI5 perspective -- a second as perceived by one person might be a very different length to a second as perceived by a different person depending on how fast they're going. You can define a second as the time it takes a pendulum of a certain length to swing once, and that time will be the same for both Person A and Person B... but Person A's pendulum might swing dozens or hundreds of times more often than Person B's pendulum from Person A's perspective during the same interval, depending on their relative speeds. (Relativity is complicated, and things get very unintuitive very quickly.) We can calculate these values consistently and show them to be real -- in fact, things like GPS satellites *depend* on us being able to calculate these values consistently -- but they're still different from the point of view of each observer. So how can we define *time* at all, if it's not the same everywhere? If time depends on how fast you're moving, how do we know that it actually even exists at all?

One way is to think about *time* not in terms of measuring it, but in terms of whether we can detect time 'happening' in the first place. (Now we're not interested in whether a second is a second, but whether a second is *anything meaningful at all*.) In that sense, what we call 'time' is really just a measurement of *change*. (After all, the only way to detect the passage of time is to note how things vary from one point to the next. You can think of it like taking two photos; if you can't detect any changes between the photos, how do you know that it's two photos taken seconds or minutes or weeks or years apart, rather than just two copies of the same photo?) One of these is the principle of *cause and effect*, namely that if an action A causes an effect B, A must have happened before (or rather, at an earlier time than) B. One way to think of 'time', then, is as a measurement of causal effect. Time *must* be progressing, because change keeps happening, and because change happens in one direction only, the value we assign to 'time' -- perhaps thought of as the countdown that has progressed from the start of everything to what we call 'now' -- has to keep increasing. The classic example is unscrambling an egg: from our perspective, the unscrambled egg must always come before the scrambled egg, and so it can be seen that time can only act in one direction; as a result, A must predate B. (The slightly more scientific formation of this thought is that [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) -- the level of 'disorder' in a system -- cannot decrease over time without putting work into the system; just as you can't expect the milk you stirred into your coffee to randomly unstir itself, you can't undo the natural processes that split apart an atom by radioactive decay. State A comes before State B, and so if you could line up all of those necessary A-before-B states from the beginning of time to now, you'd end up with what is effectively a timeline that shows a progression. You might not know how long it took between each *step* of that timeline, but you'd still be able to show that progression was happening.)

Again, this is a *very* ELI5 explanation, but [this is a pretty good rundown of why figuring out whether time is 'real' is a bigger -- and smarter -- question than it first sounds.](https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/does-time-exist-182965/) The short version is that *time* can be definitely said to exist, at least according to our current understanding; it's just the specific measurements that are fiddly and weird and often pretty arbitrary."

Then that divides and passes on the damage.

Harmless at first because it isnt too broken, but every new copy frays juuuust a little more until one bad split.

That one bad split has that cell go ABSOLUTELY BONKERS possibly even recruiting all of the cells near it with that damage to start joining it, being considered ""one of us"" by the broken cell.

Since these cells are just trying to split and split and ""repair"" damage that isnt there, the cells start filling a gap that isnt there.

Normally the body sees broken cells and gets rid of them like any other foriegn material, but these cells break in juuuust such a way that the body still thinks they're ok and, so, ignores them.
 
So, that tiny mole from sun exposure could, years down the line, have one of those melanin producing cells break and suddenly you have melanoma.

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 - What gives almost everything from the sea (from fish to shrimp to clams to seaweed) a 'seafood' flavour?,"Trimethylamine is responsible for the fishy smell. The reason you smell it on sea creatures and only sea creatures is that it helps fish resist the pressure of the water. Each 33 feet / 10m of water you go down is another atmosphere of pressure. That much pressure causes problems with cellular operation, and at greater depths, destabilizes proteins. Deep sea fish smell fishier because they can resist more water pressure.

Edit to add correction from u/is_reddit_useful:
Actually trimethylamine N-oxide helps avoid problems from pressure. It degrades into trimethylamine, which has the fishy smell. That degradation is why fresh fish has less fishy smell."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how did the WASD keys become the norm for movement on pc games? Couldnt it have been ESDF or some other set of keys?,"In a single word: Quake. Before Quake, movement controls tended to be all over the place. Arrow keys were far and away the most common, but WASD, ESDF and WASX also existed. You only shot on a single plane, so you didn't have control over vertical camera movement. Even when games advanced enough to enable that control (such as Dark Forces), you tended to use something like PgUp/PgDn for verticality. Thus it made sense for you to use the arrow keys in the right hand and spacebar, shift, ctrl, etc. in the left.

Quake popularized mouse control of camera, with independent controls for movement, even though it didn't have it enabled by default. If you wanted to git gud in those days, you had to master mouse control, and since most people are right handed, that forced movement controls to move to the left side of the keyboard. From there, WASD makes the most sense, as the letters form a simlar inverted T layout as the arrows, while still leaving all the other major keys for interaction within reach. Try using something like ESDF, I find I have to bend by wrists in at a weird angle to be able to reach shift or ctrl."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Given that eating is one of the primary needs for survival, why are human babies so reluctant about eating? They will put all kinds of things in their mouths except for the food the parent is trying to feed them.","Eating is one of the primary needs for survival, but a lot of stuff you'll find out in the wild is toxic.

Babies and children are a lot more sensitive to bitter compounds than adults are - things literally taste different to them ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4654709/)). Although they will taste pretty much everything, they will be reluctant to *swallow* green plants, which are typically bitter. This prevents them from eating wild plants that *might* be poisonous while crawling around on the forest floor, though it also means they will be reluctant to eat healthy greens.  (It also doesn't stop them from swallowing things like tasty bugs, tasteless plastics, or dangerous candy-like pills.)  Children are often neophobic as well, reluctant to eat anything they haven't *already* verified as edible and tasty, for the same reason.

So how will they get their non-toxic, healthy greens? Same way they do now - parents have been force-feeding their kids things they already *know* is safe to eat since we came out of the trees.  Before that, actually - young monkeys are also reluctant to try new foods.  (Children will also be more likely to eat something their parents offer when hungry, which was a lot more common back then.)

Notably, this sensitivity to bitterness fades as people get older. Bitter vegetables that you disliked as a child may actually taste better as an adult, which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because by then you should already know what's safe and what isn't (and can use your brain to determine whether it's worth risking a taste of an unknown food). Olives are a great example of this - they are packed with both bitter compounds and delicious fatty oils, so kids often hate them while adults love them."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: what is calculus and how does it work?,"Calculus is the study of rates of change.

Here's an algebra problem. You have a large water tank with a hole in the bottom. The water drains out at a constant rate. Given a certain amount of water to start and a rate, how long does it take to drain completely?

Here's a calculus version of the same problem. You have a large water tank with a hole in the bottom. The rate that water drains out of the tank continuously changes as the tank drains because there is less water pressure pushing water out. Given a starting amount of water and an equation that describes the rate of drainage in terms of the amount of water in the tank at each given moment, how long does it take the tank to drain?

It turns out that most real world problems involve changing rates. For example, if you have a metal bar and you start heating it at one end, heat conducts through the bar at each point based on how hot the next bit of bar over is."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do sometimes some random part of our body twitches like a heart?,"Your brain works by moving salt ions through the cell walls of its neurons. Your muscles work in a similar way.

Sometimes, your body gets a little extra salty near one of your nerves (bundles of neurons that carry neural signals between your brain and the rest of your body). That extra salt makes the nerve think that the brain is trying to send a signal (because from the nerve's perspective that's basically impossible to differentiate), so it sends a signal down to the nerve's end.

If that nerve happens to be connected to a muscle, then that muscle will twitch. But because the section that started the impulse was only a little extra salty and likely did not hit all neurons in the bundle at the same time, it only makes the muscle twitch a little instead of a big, full muscle flex.

explainlikeimfive,"eli5: why does scratching eczema (or similarly irritated skin) feel so good and provides relief in that moment, when in reality it worsens the skin condition?","This actually has 2 answers. The instant feel goods come from overriding the itch signals with literally any other stimulus. This overriding can be so pleasurable to the brain that it can make other forms of pain actually feel good. This is because an itch signal is in place so you do scratch because it is ment to help the human body realize there is something irritating the skin that needs to quickly be removed before it causes more serious damage (although the brain is easily tricked and the itch response is often triggered by things that won't be helped by scratching). The other reason it can feel so good is because intense scratching can temporary release some histamine (the itchy chemical) from the itchy area. This temporary relieves the itch, but because of the damage caused by the scratching, more histamine is produced and makes you even more itchy after.

Edit:damn, guess y'all really wanted to know why scratching an itch feels so damn good."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why were the Irish so dependent on potatoes as a staple food at the time of the Great Famine? Why couldn't they just have turned to other grains as an alternative to stop more deaths from happening?,"I see a number of people here think that only potatoes were grown in Ireland. The reality was that Ireland produced large amounts of grain and animal products like pork, beef and dairy. However *everything* other than potatoes was sold to pay rent on their ""farms"" which had been made tiny by the enforced division among children - the traditional Irish way was the oldest inherited the land but the British imposed their ideas instead, reducing the population to devastating poverty. While all these goodies were being exported, the Irish actually did quite well on potatoes and milk, probably better than their equivalents in other countries who subsisted on bread and cheese.

However once the potato blight hit, their food source was wiped out. The US sent some grain ships to try to help but, because of the English Corn Laws, they were not allowed to land their cargo in case they depressed the prices in the markets. [Turkey did send some grain](https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201501/an.irish.tale.of.hunger.and.the.sultan.htm) and snuck it into Drogheda with the legacy that the Star and Crescent is now a common motif in the town, even appearing on the [local football team's logo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDrogheda_United_F.C.&psig=AOvVaw2r2Ipj6h_oKePOKgCVYn2i&ust=1675891431403000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDEw52shP0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). Probably the most notable contribution was the few dollars sent by the [Choctaw Nation](https://xyuandbeyond.com/irish-famine-and-the-choctaw-nation/) even though they had almost nothing after the Trail of Tears. 

The tiny amount of relief provided by the British was to set up soup kitchens where the starving could get food if they changed their religion to Protestantism, and support for road building where the work was stretched out by the creation of winding roads.

TL;DR: The other foodstuffs they had to hand were sent to England to make money for their landlords, so the potato crop's failure meant starvation."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 why older cartridge games freeze on a single frame rather than crashing completely? What makes the console ""stick"" on the last given instruction, rather than cutting to a color or corrupting the screen?","The way games usually work is that there is a large part of the executed code to calculate the game world (i.e. where is everything, what values does everything have, what is the next step for the AI, etc.), and then render the scene in one go and update the screen with that new scene rendition. The graphics card will just put on screen whatever it was last told to output, forever.

So if any of that fails, you are stuck with whatever the latest ""update the screen"" did. 

In modern software, the game runs in a container, which is monitored by the operating system, and as soon as a crash is detected, the OS will kill that container, present a nice error message to the user, and then continue on as if the game was never started.

In older consoles, the game was basically taking direct control of the console's hardware, including the graphics card, so if the game crashed there was nothing there to detect that crash and order the graphics card to display something else. Same goes with input controllers etc., so your only option was to unplug the power supply and reboot the console."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why is Bluetooth so much flakier than USB, WiFi, etc?","I used to work in a radio test house, I've tested hundreds of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi products. Overall, Bluetooth (now) is a great protocol, that is forced into shit situations.

The 2.4 GHz spectrum is quite crowded. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, baby monitors and many other protocols use it (so do some microwaves). The reason why is that it's a worldwide unlicensed band, meaning that it's legal to use 2.4 GHz in North America, Europe, China, or anywhere. Compare this to cellular, which will automatically switch bands when you go to different countries, that's a lot more complicated.

Within the 2.4 GHz band, there's not really any rules about what's needed to coexist with other products (unless you're a medical product in the US). There's regulations, but they aren't concerned about saying what happens if Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi want to transmit at the same frequency at the same time. The opinion of governing bodies is if you can't handle coexisting in unlicensed bands, then use licensed spectrum. Overall, this means each protocol has its own way of dealing with getting data through.

For Wi-Fi, it buffers. Wi-Fi can transmit between 1Mbps and 65Mbps (speeds can go much higher, but this is what's doable on one channel and one antenna at 2.4 GHz using 802.11n). Meanwhile, Bluetooth only operates between 125kbps and 3Mbps, and if you're using something with a small battery like earbuds, then 2Mbps is likely the max. Overall, this means that Wi-Fi is much more likely to have more buffered than Bluetooth, and therefore you're less likely to have interruptions. Wi-Fi also uses much more power on average, and if you're using more power, you're more likely to get those higher data rates.

How Bluetooth deals with the crowded spectrum is frequency hopping. Basically, Bluetooth scans for open channels, identifies them, and hops between them. However, if something suddenly appears on that channel, like Wi-Fi, it can ruin that transmission. It's also possible there's just not really any open channels and Bluetooth just needs to do the best it can.

Bluetooth is also very cheap. You can buy a pre-approved module, slap it in a product, and boom, now you have a ""smart"" product. Or at least, that's how it's sold by module manufacturers. In reality, you can do 100 things wrong when installing your module. You could put it in a metal box which kills transmission power. You can slam it between other circuit boards which causes wicked harmonics. You can put it right next to an LCD screen which causes radio desensitization. These problems exist for a Wi-Fi module too, however, since Wi-Fi costs a little bit more, if someone uses Wi-Fi they're not cheaping out everywhere, and it's more likely they've hired qualified engineers and know how to alleviate the issues I discussed previously.

The other area where Bluetooth suffers is that, even in very well designed products, like airpods, it's being forced into crappy situations. The body attenuates 2.4 GHz quite seriously, and, airpods are very small and closer to the body compared to the wireless headphones of 20 years ago. Also, they're not communicating with a laptop that's in front of you, it's communicating with a phone that's on the other side of your body in your pocket. Often you'll find that if you're in a normal sized room, you'll be fine, but when you're outside you drop communication. This is because Bluetooth is echoing off the wall to communicate with the earbuds.

Bluetooth has adapted in the following ways over their generations: they've upped the data rate, they've released Bluetooth Low Energy (which is basically a whole new protocol designed to save battery life), they've introduced long range mode which goes down to 125kbps so you have a better chance of getting something through, and they've worked with cell phone manufacturers to get Bluetooth testing to be more self-regulated."

Step 17: All possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols

\-

EDIT: Since the question keeps popping up; Why are attackers allowed unlimited tries, when the website or app or whatever usually locks you out after a certain number of attempts?

First of all, a short summary of how passwords are actually used:

When you create your account and enter a password, some fancy math is done on that password which results in a really big number. This big number is then stored in the database along with your username, like this:

    AquaRegia: 54156138456156047798
    SomeOtherGuy: 13259746130447797411
    ...

When you try to login, you enter your username and password. The same fancy math is used on the password you just entered, and the result is compared to the number that's stored in the database. If it matches, you're in!

Brute-forcing passwords is almost never done against the actual platform. Instead what happens is that the database of a website/app/etc. gets hacked, and someone manages to get a hold of this list of username + number pairs. Then without actually having to use the website/app/etc. they can just run the same fancy math on all possible passwords, and compare the results to the numbers from the database."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 : What is Autism?,"Everyone has a brain. Brains tell us how to think, feel, move, and sense things. Brains are wired up like a computer or other electronics with their own circuits and connections. 

Autism is a different type of brain wiring that some people are born with. This different wiring means that interacting with others, communicating, understanding or expressing emotions or experiencing senses can be more difficult compared to how many people experience the world. 

Many Autistic people have very strong hobbies and interests and like to do things in the same way again and again. This means some Autistic people can be really knowledgeable about the things they're interested in, or get great joy from spending time doing them. 

Many Autistic people feel calm when they follow a familiar routine and know what to expect. Changing things means uncertainty, so that can be scary. Some Autistic people might also enjoy certain sensations like rocking, spinning, bouncing, or fiddling with things, both because it helps them to stay calm when they get overwhelmed, or just because it feels really good!

Autistic people might communicate differently to people around them. Some Autistic people will sign, or not speak with words. Others can speak the same as others, but might use words differently, struggle to hear when people speak in a noisy environment, or find speaking difficult when they are upset. Autistic people might also not know how to understand the type of communication others do with their faces, bodies and tone of voice, which is called body language. Some Autistic people can learn to understand this over time, but it might take a bit of extra effort. Because of these communication differences, Autistic people and people who aren't might have to work a bit harder to be friends with each other, and be patient. But that's okay. Everyone can learn to be patient with time, even if it's hard. 

Being Autistic doesn't mean there is anything wrong with a person. Everyone is different, and being Autistic is just the way that person is different. They will always be Autistic because it's a way of being that you're born with, like eye colour or hair colour. 

Like everyone in the world, people who are Autistic might need some extra help sometimes to do things they want or need to do. But that's okay. Everyone needs some help sometimes, and the differences everyone has make the world an interesting place to be. It would be boring if everyone was exactly the same!

But this is technology that was added on to email later, so it's not watertight and not universally used. Email is also not controlled by one central company, so verification is limited to the domain name(of which ownership can be verified). Someone could still send you 'valid' phishing mails from visually similar domain names (something like peypal.com).

Now, verified profiles with centralized platforms can also have issues. In the case of Twitter, it is simply a question of money. If you pay $8/month, you're verified.

Tin and copper (bronze) can be refined just by heating it in an oxygen poor environment, such as a camp fire. Iron requires somewhat more heat and needs to react with coal to form pure iron from iron oxide but even this is relatively easy. However aluminium can not be refined in this way at all. Even today we can not refine aluminium this way. Aluminium is refined using electrolysis which requires huge electric power plants nearby. So we needed to find up electricity before we could start mass producing aluminium.

We did however use aluminium oxide for various things before we used the metal. It is an excellent abrasive which is used in for example sand paper. So we did mine aluminium and there are actually some very cool advancements in chemically separating ores which were first invented for aluminium. And there are actually a couple of extremely rare aluminium artifacts from the middle ages which we do not know how were made. But the rarity of them suggest that it was not something done at any large scale, each item was likely the lifes work of several people."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How does a Geiger counter detect radiation, and why does it make that clicking noise?","Certain kinds of radiation can knock the electrons off atoms, turning them into ions (charged particles). This can turn a gas that can't conduct electricity into ions that can.

Geiger counters exploit this...they setup a tube of low pressure gas with a really high electrical voltage across the gas. The gas is normally an insulator (doesn't conduct electricity), but if radiation comes through it ionizes the gas so that it becomes conductive and electricity can flow. That creates a big electric pulse that's easy for the electronics in the counter to measure.

It's also really simple to connect that pulse signal to a speaker. And the sound of a short electrical pulse through a speaker is...a click. 

So the clicks are literally the electrical pulses released by each radiation particle zipping through the counter. It's a simple, visceral, and effective way to tell the operator what's going on."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why does the bus driver on a school bus get a seatbelt but no one else?,"Those horrible school bus seats are so weirdly shaped and uncomfortable because every single one is basically a fire-retardant roll cage. School buses are insanely strong, and insanely safe. In a head-on accident, students who are sitting properly basically can't be thrown from their seats, because they're so high and so close together.

Seat belts on buses may *increase* injuries, because serious school bus problems are more likely to involve smoke, fire, or rapid evacuation -- where seat belts delay evacuation -- than to involve a situation where seat belts would help more than the high seat backs. (And it's not necessarily the school bus that's smoking -- it could be an out-of-control car runs into the bus -- the bus is fine -- the car is smoking, the smoke is going in the bus, and the bus needs to evacuate.)

Some states or municipalities require seat belts on buses with under-5s, because they're not very good at sitting in their seats properly and may be too small for the high seats to protect them in a crash. But they then typically also require extra adults on the bus because in an evacuation situation, *those kids can't unbuckle themselves* and can't evacuate fast enough.

But basically the only situation in which seat belts on a bus are better than no seat belts on a bus is for students who cannot position themselves properly in the seat (often due to a physical disability), and in those cases there needs to be an aide to assist in unbuckling in an emergency. (I am not actually a huge fan of under-5s on school buses, because either option is more dangerous than a school bus ought to be -- although still WAY LESS DANGEROUS than basically any other transportation option!)

It's difficult to overstate how safe school buses are. In my state (in most, possibly all), they have to pass a thorough inspection, including the mechanicals, *every. single. day.* They have to pass a comprehensive state inspection by outside inspectors every few months. The local school bus mechanics who do the daily inspections have to pass rigorous evaluations from the state. Audits are extensive.

I actually find it very frustrating when parents get all upset about bus safety and start demanding seatbelts, and school districts don't present the *extremely clear and comprehensive data* about why seat belts don't improve safety. When you explain it, and give them all the nice materials from the federal regulators, they typically understand WHY no seat belts is safer, and they tell other parents. But too many school boards are like, ""Fine, shut up, whatever"" and so make their school buses less-safe in the name of safety.

ETA: Oh yeah, the bus driver gets a seat belt because if there were a nice high seatback in front of him, instead of the windshield, he couldn't drive. So he gets a belt because he's the one guy on the bus who can be thrown out of the vehicle in a head-on collision."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - What is empathy and how does one feel it?,"Yay, a question regarding my field of study!

Scientifically, we do not know entirely how it works, but we have a good general idea. Time for the explanation:

When you get home after a very hot summer day and grab a glass of water and gulp it in two seconds, you do this because you are thirsty. You did all the things you did (open the cupboard, get a glass, fill it with water, raise it to your mouth, swallow the water) because you were thirsty.

All these actions had one cause: you were thirsty -- an internal state no one can ""see"", a feeling.

When you see someone do a certain set of actions or displaying a certain behavior, you interpret what they are doing as if that were you (with some adjustments depending on how well you know the person).

So, when you see a family member come home after a hot summer day, immediately going to the kitchen to drink some water, you don't merely see their actions, you also feel their thirst (on a very moderate level), because you know what it is like to be thirsty.

In short: you do/express X because you feel Y. When you see others do X, you'll perceive them as feeling Y.

A bit more in depth: empathy seems to have its origin on something called ""mirror neurons"" and to be connected to our constitution of ourselves as individuals and our relationship between our mind (internal states) and our physical body. Our familiarity with the other is also very important, which can be seen in cases where, for example, owners know exactly what their pets want, even though they don't express any human-like behaviors (and the opposite is also true, since it is almost impossible for us to empathize with, for example, a spider, since its reality is so distant from ours that we can't fathom what it is like to be a spider in that moment).

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why is it so impressive that India landed on the South side of the Moon?,"It is impressive that they landed on the moon, period. Only 3 countries have done it before (USA, USSR and China). Plenty have tried and failed, including India itself in an earlier attempt. This successful mission puts them in a very elite space club.

Landing on the south pole is doubly impressive because the area is very hazardous and no one has been able to pull off a landing over there before this.

From a scientific standpoint the south pole of the moon is important because it is largely unexplored and scientists have theorized that craters over there hold large quantities of ice. This mission will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the moon, especially related to the goal of establishing a base there."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: How did the term ""Goth"" go from Germanic tribes destroying Rome, to the music and fashion we know today?","To add another step, there was a Gothic Revival around the early 19th century, largely as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, mass production, conformity and the ""dark satanic mills"". There was great interest in the medieval or native pre-industrial styles across art, architecture, music and literature. 

It took a while before 19th c. gothic revival architecture actually started to look anything like actual gothic architecture, interestingly, because almost everything had been forgotten and needed to be relearned. Early Victorian Gothic can look very cack-handed.

In literature, you had the great Romantic and Gothic writers like Wordsworth, the Bronte sisters, Mrs and Mr Shelly, and on into people like Stoker and ""Dracula"". They all loved individualism, intense emotion, moody looking into middle distance, and a flamboyant disregard for one's continuing existence.

The term moved over into music from there, as other posts have said."

explainlikeimfive,"Eli5-If a virus isn’t technically alive, I would assume it doesn’t have instinct. Where does it get its instructions/drive to know to infect host cells and multiply?","Imagine you had an IKEA instruction manual. It tells you to get some paper, some ink, and 2 staples and make a copy of the manual. It also tells you to stick it in a box and leave the copy on your neighbor's porch.

Is there a purpose to doing this? No. But there are now two version of it anyway. Does it have guiding instincts? Still no, but it didn't need them. It got in your home somehow and used you to make a second copy which is about to infect your neighbor. Similarly, viruses give instructions to your cells to make copies. There are some safeguards against this, but in general, you just churn out new versions that infect others, repeating the process.

Why we have different effects of viruses very simply boils down to (1) how they get into your house (cell), (2) how they tell you to make copies, and (3) how they stop the cops from busting your illegal IKEA instruction manual production ring.

1. Viruses are dumb, but they can recognize certain things. Covid, for instance, has patterns on it that match up to something called the ACE-2 receptor. This is a pretty common receptor, but there is a lot of it in the nose and lungs (where are most of your symptoms?). This starts a series of steps that results in the replication material getting inside.

2. Once it is inside, the virus has to get your body to make copies. Some viruses (ie: Herpes/HIV) are long term because part of their instruction manual told the previous host to make some machinery that busts open your DNA and inserts the virus. Others are more short-term and simply tell your cells to make a bunch of copies really quickly.

3. One of the most important parts of viruses is how they stop your immune system. Your cells tend to occasionally display what they are currently working on, analogous to a window into the house. Your immune system has a black-list of certain compounds and will straight up burn the house down if you aren't working on something it approves of. Certain viruses, like influenza, are able to mutate though. While your immune system is looking for the red IKEA catalog, the flu has 1000's of variations of the catalog. While you are immune to any red IKEA catalog versions, you have to learn that the blue I-KEA catalog is just as bad.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why can’t we burn more or less calories by working our brain when it already uses a fifth of our daily energy usage?,"It’s because “conscious thought” is only a small part of what your brain actually does and therefore a small part of its energy expenditure. Increasing the intensity and duration of conscious thought is only slightly increasing the work that your brain is doing.

Your brain, through the nervous system, also regulates the majority of your body functions, including your enzyme and hormone systems. So if you want to fire your brain right up you need to not only think more but feel more and do more stuff.

If you want to increase your brain’s work rate across most of its functions, and hence achieve a higher energy burn, you can. But the methods are normally not things you should do flippantly, for example taking certain drugs or getting into very stressful situations.

Even if you’re able to achieve safe conditions, it’s not a good idea to do this a lot. Your brain, like any other organ, wears out. There’s a reason it’s evolved to be very efficient at what it does.

Edit: a lot of people talking about chess because of an ESPN article. Chess players don’t burn 6000 additional calories playing chess. There was a great reply below from u/avocadokadabra that referenced another Reddit thread where this was debunked: [you can find it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/s0tqcd/chess_grandmasters_do_not_burn_6000_calories_a_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I’d also like to add that in my comment I explicitly separate “conscious thought” from subsequent physiological effects, although they may be _related_ to conscious thought. In the example of the chess games, it’s clear (even in the often misquoted ESPN article) that the majority of the additional energy burn is not happening in the brain, it’s happening in the rest of the body as a result of elevated blood pressure, excessive breathing, and it’s certainly not due to conscious thought, it’s the systemic effects of being in a hyper-stressful situation.

I’m so glad this generated a lot of conversation! :-)"

Also, trees are ridiculously easy to grow in places like the US. You don’t need pesticides or irrigation or much labor to make them grow, and it’s efficient/fast to harvest them because each one is huge. Even if trees produce wood slower than bamboo, that’s ok, you just need more land to farm the amount of trees you want. Let one patch of land regrow while you harvest a different one, and in several years, you’ll have trees again in the first place. 

Land suitable for growing trees is in ample supply in a place like the US. Because it’s so easy to harvest and regrow trees, you just need enough land to provide trees at the rate you want, and it’s very cost effective and easy."

It will do this at a very fast rate, fast enough to trip your circuit breakers and shut off the electricity.

Funny story: About a decade ago the credit bureaus introduced their own score, the VantageScore, to try to break up the FICO monopoly.  FICO sued them claiming that VantageScore, which at the time used a different scoring range (500 to 990, I think?) infringed a trademark FICO had taken out over the range 300-850 — because some of the numbers overlapped.

Unfortunately, it's not possible to make any absolute and certain statements, since this is an area of ongoing medical research. We can only say what seems currently likely.

Relatively recent research suggests that the placebo effect has been overestimated; some of the foundational studies that ""established"" the placebo effect failed to account for certain factors, such as regression to the mean.

""Regression to the mean"", in practice, is the really simple fact that most patients get better. Even if they have a disease that is permanent and the body can't fix it, people have ups and downs within that context; and they tend to be going to get treatment when they're in the ""downs"".

There does appear to be some amount of small measurable effect. It's strongest in subjective measures; in particular, in pain. This makes sense as the *experience* of pain is fundamentally a neural phenomenon, something that is happening in the brain. It is well known that mental state significantly affects pain - it's why people can ignore pain during a fight, for example. Things like stress, comfort, etc. have a major effect on pain.

So this kind of interference has now a figurative meaning that could be explained as ""something unexpectedly giving a solution to a seemingly unsolvable problem"" with emphasis on unexpectedly and unsolvable. 

So being held hostage at gunpoint and a police sniper killing the hostage taker isn't deus ex machina as police is trained to deal with situations like this and expected to act accordingly.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 - How do divers dive from like 170 some feet in the air and have zero damage, but if someone jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge, they are probably going to die.","When you hit water from a dive the forces on you are related to how fast you decelerate on entry to the water, and the rate you decelerate is related to how fast you’re going when you hit the water. More speed = more force = more injury.

The Golden Gate Bridge is about another ~70 feet higher than the world record high dive.

The additional speed you pick up from that additional fall distance is enough that the deceleration forces upon impact with the water become high enough that even an ideal dive would result in severe, and life threatening, injuries.

The force involved here is because the faster you hit the water the faster you have to accelerate a volume of water about equal to your own volume and push it out of the way to make space for your own volume to enter the water. If you weigh, say, 150 lbs then you’re gonna need to push 150 lbs of water out of the way in the time it takes for you to enter the water, except that water is all surrounded by other water that you also need to push out of the way. It takes a lot of effort to push all that water any noticeable distance in the ~0.05 seconds it takes for your body to fully enter the water after jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge, that work is performed by your body decelerating at something like 20g (or more depending how you hit) to transfer energy from you to the water.

2. Rubbing it between your fingers. If you take a small amount and rub it between your fingers it should dissolve completely and feel a little greasy. If there are any clumps that is the the cut and not the coke. 

3. Smell. This isn't always applicable but if your coke has a smell to it. It should smell like gasoline or just a little like chemicals. But the better the coke the less smell it has. This has to do with how it's made, if it was a rushed job or it had the proper amount of time to cook. 

You should follow the previous steps before you get to this point. The previous steps will help determine if your coke was cut with cheaper shit and if it has the essence of good coke.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do they know how many people died so soon after a major disaster?,"They make estimates based on a number of known figures, like X number of people lived in whatever building, and they estimate downwards. That's why the figures go up throughout the period immediately afterwards,  those figures get revised based on emergency responders, hospitals, etc."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: why are our brains not with the other vital organs? They're all in the same part of the body, except the brain.","It’s an evolutionary answer - the bodies of most animals are essentially a tube with a mouth and an anus.  Many early animals were pretty much just this (think of a flat worm) - primitive eyes, olfaction etc developed at the entry end because that’s where they’d be most useful for hunting, movement and so on. 

As the sensory systems became more developed they required more processing power to make sense of the information they were gathering, forming more and more complex clusters of neurons.   Eventually a group of animals called the craniates diverged, wrapping these neuronal clusters in protective layers of tissue and eventually bone, forming early skulls with jaws, eye sockets etc.  It’s evolutionary advantageous to have the sensory organs and processing close together, so this set up was pretty stable. 

Because evolution can’t go back and start again between generations, only tinker with what exists, the basic body plan of almost all animal life, with the sensory organs mostly clustered in one place, became set pretty early on, which is why virtually every animal has that basic set up with its brain separate from its body."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 Why is the human body is symmetrical in exterior, but inside the stomach and heart is on left side? what advantages does it give to us?","Symmetry is important for locomotion, stereovision and so on. The body parts that are relevant for those features are all symmetrical. The organs inside the chest cavity and stomach don't require full or any symmetry. A long symmetric intestinal tract is practically impossible and organs of which we only need a single one can't all accumulate right in the center of the body, so, over time, they shifted to one of the sides where there was space for them and that's where we have them now."
explainlikeimfive,ELi5: Why did eggs become such a common breakfast food?,"Most food choices were based on what was easy to raise and farm in an area. Chickens are easy to raise just about anywhere and provide an ample amount of eggs. They average 1 egg a day. 

Eggs are good for you (except for a few years in the 1990s), are easy to cook, and can be cooked in a variety of ways quickly. 

They specifically became breakfast food because eggs were typically laid in the mornings. It was better to eat them at their freshest.

Edit: updating due to correct comments on eggs and refrigeration.

Edit 2: there are several explanations about the 90s in the comments for those that don't know or didn't exist at the time."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: How did ancient civilizations in 45 B.C. with their ancient technology know that the earth orbits the sun in 365 days and subsequently create a calender around it which included leap years?,"They watched the sun.  They knew about solstices (high point, low point of sun in sky).  They tracked how many days between the solstices.  They were interested in this because it correlated with growing seasons.

None of this happened overnight.  There is always a large amount of trial and error involved in the development of ancient calendars.  The idea of a leap year was a ‘fix’ to a calendar that wasn’t quite right.  It seems like it happened instantly but if you look back, the trial-and-error time was often quite lengthy."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5: When people used wells for drinking water, how did they not get sick? Was there some type of filter or was the water just naturally clean?","People do still use wells for water. Water is effectively “filtered” through sand and soil which trap contaminants. Also, most diseases that infect humans only thrive and multiply in the human body (or sometimes in other animals) so if the water has moved through the ground for months before it reaches the well, there is a chance the germs have just died out by the time somebody drinks it.

Not all wells are safe however, in developed countries there are regulations on where you can put a well for drinking water and testing the water before using a well is either recommended or required. There are still cases of wells being contaminated by factories or people dumping waste, however. In poorer areas it is more common for people to get sick due to lack of testing and lack of control on where chemicals or waste may be disposed of"

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why are all remains of the past buried underground? Where did all the extra soil come from?,"Charles Darwin dug into this question. Via an interest in earthworms.     

Earthworms bring soil up from under the surface and leave it on top of the existing surface, making it the new surface. He estimated that in the region he studied, earthworms brought up 15 tons of soil per acre per year.  The process is called [bioturbation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioturbation) and it's not limited to worms.     

The worms remove soil from all the ground, whether it's under the wall of an abandoned building or not.  But when they deposit the earth on the surface, they can't deposit any where that wall is, obviously. It gets deposited wherever the ruins aren't.  The end result is that backyard stones and ruined cities sink because the ground underneath them is getting cycled up to the ground around them.     

EDIT:  This comment has received a lot of replies and I don't want to clutter up the thread, so I'll just respond here.    

I didn't intend this as a broad explanation of buried ruins. Obviously there are soil/sand redistributions which blanket a whole area, either progressively (eg by wind) or abruptly (eg by flood). They had already been covered by other comments, and I didn't think it was necessary to repeat them.    

But I thought it was worth breaking the supposition that soil is static, and that the *only* way the ground can rise relative to a building is for the soil to be brought there from somewhere else.  If Darwin's measurements are right, then worms have cycled 30,000 tons of soil per acre in the years since Boudica fought the Romans.      

As a final fun fact, Darwin's book about worms had better initial sales numbers than *On the Origin of Species* did.     

Have a great day everyone."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5:Why is there a labor shortage when unemployment is low?,"There are several effects that can cause this.

First - the number of job slots is not fixed.

Imagine there's 100,000 people looking for work, 100,000 jobs, and 98,000 of the possible workers have jobs. You've got 2% unemployment (2k out of 100k). This would not really be considered a ""shortage""; a small amount of unemployment and open positions is normal as people shift jobs over time, etc.

Now imagine there's 20,000 more job positions opened, but the population is unchanged. Now you have the same 2% unemployment but a major ""labor shortage"" - one in six jobs is unfilled.

Second - the population can decline. As others have mentioned, the ""people looking for work"" is not the same as number of total ""people"". For example, instead of 100k possible workers you now have 95k possible workers.

Third - shortage doesn't necessarily mean that ""there's no X"", it's also used fairly frequently to mean ""X is more expensive"". In the above example, with the same 100k people, the same 100k jobs, and the same 98k people working in jobs - if the workers are now demanding a higher rate to work, the employers are likely to describe that as a ""labor shortage"".

Fourth - shortages are not necessarily ""global"". Let's say the country has two industries, steel and food. Same original stats - 100k possible workers, 100k positions, 2% unemployment - so 2k unemployed workers and 2k open jobs. In an ""evenly distributed"" case, the 2k open jobs would be 1k each between steel and food, and the unemployed workers would have their skills and interests evenly split between those. But what if all 2k open jobs are in the food industry, and all of the unemployed workers have steel-making skills and interest? Now the food industry is unable to get new hires at all while the steel industry has extra.

In the practical world, a combination of factors is usually at play, and all of the above can be found to various extents."

explainlikeimfive,"Eli5, Why can't suits be washed in the washing machine?","I’m a former suit salesmen. It depends on the kind of suit you’re talking about. I’ve sold everything from high street (€100) to Tom Ford (€6,000)

Cotton or linen? 

You can machine wash them. You just need to put them on a very delicate wash and make sure you shape them as you dry them. If you have a shaping hanger, this helps. It literally looks kinda like a torso. These are usually unlined suits so they don’t have any real structure to them. 

Wool or wool blend?

Literally no need to machine wash them, sponging and pressing will get most stains out of them. Wool is durable. No need to even dry clean most of them. If you ask your dry cleaner to sponge and press instead, the suit will thank you for it. Unless you’re a sweat monster when you’re wearing them, then do the suit a favour. 

However, on more expensive suits there is a structure underneath the suit, it’s usually made out of horse hair and it’s really delicate. You can actually damage this just by folding it wrong or leaning on it in a weird way but you absolutely don’t want to get it wet. Now the weight of the fabric of your suit will determine how much you need to worry about getting wet. On the lighter fabrics, you basically don’t even want someone breathing heavily near you but on the heavier tweeds etc, it’s all good. A horse could piss on you and the structure would be fine. The fabric might be a bit fucked though.

The shoulder structure is an absolute mess when you see it without lining and fabric around it. If you have ever seen the inside of a mattress or sofa, that’s what it looks like. The tailors do all the fancy stitching where you can see it but where it doesn’t matter they are like “fuck it whatever”.

I used to work in printer tech support  and when Windows 10 came out I really hoped they had made some improvements, but no. Even the simple act of canceling a print job depends on the goodwill of the driver, but the reason for wanting to cancel it is often that the driver pooped its pants and the job got stuck. Windows should be able to detect this and enforce action, but you still have to fix it by hand.

Printer ""ports"" is also a concept dating back to Windows 95 or maybe even earlier, and they frequently get messed up for no good reason, or because the driver tries to be helpful and work around the archaic system, with another system which is completely opaque to users and thus a mess to troubleshoot."

The US Space Force maintains the GPS constellation and tracks all these satellites; they upload this information to the GPS satellites for rebroadcast to every GPS receiver.  Your phone, or any internet connected device, will download this data automatically over the internet.  Old GPS receivers had to rely on the GPS satellites rebroadcasting ephemeris and almanac data to get this information; the broadcast takes about 12.5 minutes to send all the information.  Once it knows where each satellite is, it needs to figure out which satellites it can actually see to get a rough idea of what part of the world you're in.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is smoking weed “better” than smoking cigarettes or vaping? Aren’t you inhaling harmful foreign substances in all cases?,"A small note on vaping vs smoking (anything).

For people who live in the EU (or are still affected by EU laws *cough* UK) vaping is safer than both. That's not to say that vaping is *safe*, just *safer*. The reason I specify the EU is because the components of e-liquid are tightly regulated so that they contain exactly one toxic chemical - nicotine. Anything else should be deemed safe for inhalation. I'm aware that in the US you don't necessary know what else is being thrown into the juice. 

The long term effects of vaping are not known but we know there are dangers associated with nicotine, such as reduced fertility and - if used during pregnancy- a higher risk to the child. In any case, vaping is pretty objectively a *good* thing for *ex-smokers* who have had difficulty quitting in other ways - it's just another version of NRT. But it's only good in the sense that it is much, much less harmful than breathing in smoke of any kind. It can only be a bad thing for non smokers who take up vaping though."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did Great Britain have so much power and influence considering how small it is? How did they manage to colonise the entirety of India so easily?,"Great Britian, being an island nation, had no real land-based conflicts.  This meant that they didn't need to waste much money on armies, comparatively.  It also meant that they didn't get embroiled in many of the conflicts of the European mainland.

They did, however, have strong enemies just a short boat ride away.  This mean that their naval forces needed to be very powerful - as any act of offense or defense would start with the navy.  Naval supremacy allowed them to not only colonize far away, but control the shipping lanes to and from colonies.

Controlling those shipping lanes meant that if you wanted to trade, you needed to be in the good graces of the British Empire.  Local colonies would support colonization because the _right_ local people were made very rich through the profits from trade.  As is true today, if you make the right people rich you can subjugate any society."

Or it takes 5 minutes to run a simple bash command in Terminal. It’s not taking 5 minutes to compile something or do anything particularly difficult.

Well, here is the question: is it a 10 year old Mac running 10 year old Mac OS (don't know what the catchy name of it was at the time, last time I used Mac OS it was Snow Leopard), or is it a 10 year old Mac running the CURRENT Mac OS with all updates installed,.with current versions of programs with all THEIR updates installed?

Operating Systems, as they are iterated year after year, generally add more and more features to create a better user experience and add to the ""reason"" you should upgrade to the next version, but usually those features require more and more power from the machine, which your machine doesn't have.  This is repeated by many programs, whose developers will say things like ""we don't need to optimize our program to use less than 4GB of Memory when 98% of our userbase has 16; the effort in optimizing is only going to help 2% of our customers""

The bombs were quite large in terms of mass and quite inefficient. So only a fraction of fisille material in the bombs got used up. The rest was scattered with the blast as fallout. That isn't too good, but :
In Hiroshima, the city got washed with typhoon rain that flooded the rebuilding city. It destroyed many of the just rebuilt services but it also washed the city as some of the fallout got washed into the bay. That helped a lot with radiation.

I agree with most of the descriptions already said, but I want to emphasize a few things that haven't been mentioned.

Pharmacists also work at hospitals, and one of the biggest things they do is help with treatment decisions. They advise me on medications like chemotherapy, and antibiotics. They save the hospital and patient money by selecting cheaper and better medications. They improve patient care by reminding me that a patient might benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis, or that a certain medication might work better. They adjust doses of medications for patients receiving dialysis and ECMO. Just like when I consult a neurologist for when a patient has a stroke, I think of a pharmacist as a medication expert, and every patient I treat receives medication. I don't make any major inpatient medication decisions without pharmacist involvement.

They catch mistakes, and they do it better than any other allied health professional. 

In my observation, in the [Swiss cheese model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model), the pharmacist is the slice with the fewest holes. I think they save more lives in the hospital than anyone else, and they get almost no credit for this. Many patients have no idea how much they owe to their pharmacist, and many hospital administrators don't understand their value.

Too few hospitals include a clinical pharmacist on rounds, and many only relegate their pharmacists to central supply, where they verify orders. Having a pharmacist on rounds makes me a better doctor, and allows me to efficiently manage several more patients. Our hospital system is nationally recognized for high outcomes in quality, and a key reason for that is our use of clinical pharmacists.

So, if there are any pharmacists reading this, please know that you have my sincere respect and thanks."

Why? When you're in the middle of the ocean, you can only really look up at the stars and measure angles to figure out when you are.

A ""normal"" mile.

This is the short version of the story. (With many things condensed or altered for easier understanding)

The romans were neat and tidy. A pace was 2 steps and 5 feet long (different feet than we use). A roman mile was 1000 paces or 5000 feet. 1/8th of a mile (625 feet) is called a stadia (this is where the term stadium comes from.. guess how long the Colosseum is).

The romans marched to England.

The english had their own measures, importantly, the furlong.

When you plough a field, you make furrows in the ground. The length you go before resting your animal is a furrows length, a ""furlong.""
The area you plough in a day is an acre. (Officially, it is a 1.0x0.1 area)

An acre is, by definition, 1 furlong in length... this is important.

The furlong and the stadia were similar in length. Why use the foreign word when you already have a word for it?. They became synonymous.

A furlong is Officially 220 yards or 660 feet. (The acre is 22 yards/66 feet wide. This length is called a chain because surveyors used 100 link chains of 22 yards to measure land).. remember, the stadia is 625 feet.

This didn't matter right up until it did. Tax!

Land area measures are important for a lot of things but tax was a big one. Having a mess in the middle distances and area measures was a problem.

England had a choice. Shorten the furlong and acre and reduce all the smaller units too (affecting everyones daily life), or, make the mile longer.

Distance Officially starts with a grain of barley. 3 laid end to end makes 1 inch. 12 inches makes a foot (inch literally means 1/12th), 3 feet make a yard, 5.5 yards make a perch/rod (not common anymore), 40 perches make a furlong (chains are more modern), an acrea is 40 perches long and 4 perches wide, and furlong keeps getting the be 1/8th of a mile so the mile is now 1760 yards or 5280 feet."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5:Why do games have launchers? Why can't they just launch the game when you open the program?,">Why do games have launchers?

Usually launchers serve the purpose of being a way to update the game separately. Before libraries like steam were popular, games had to update themselves, and it was easier to have an entirely separate program dedicated to the task. But these days, things like steam handle updates for you, so no need to provide it as a required feature.

It also allows you to do things like change and configure your game settings without launching the game. It really sucks to fix your game settings when there's an issue causing a crash on launch for example, so launchers allow you to negate that.

Mod loading is another big reason for the same reason as the settings. Managing and sorting your mods has to be done outside the game, usually because crashes and conflicts are common.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do insects deal with sunlight in their eyes given that they have no eyelids and no moving eye parts?,"The human eye uses a large lens which focuses light onto the retina. It's a very effective way to capture light, and our retinas are quite sensitive over a wide range of brightness. A downside is that very bright lights like the sun get focused onto the delicate retina so intensely, it causes damage.

Insects, on the other hand, have compound eyes that don't use large lenses. These eyes have an excellent field of view and ability to detect motion, but aren't so sensitive to light.

Overall, insect eyes don't focus light as intensely, and focus it onto less sensitive tissue."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why is ""older"" whiskey generally considered better than ""newer"" whiskey? And does this apply to all alcohol?","Two things happen to whiskey as it ages:

1) It picks up flavor from the casks. This...actually isn't that hard to accelerate. Adding wood chips or a honey-comb type lattice greatly increases the exposed surface area and thus how quickly it acquires that favor. 

2) Sulfates and a few other compounds are able to pass into and through the barrels, leaving the whiskey. These are responsible for a lot of the harsh/unpleasant flavor you get in cheap shooting whiskeys compare to nicer sipping ones and so far there has not been a reliable and cheap way to eliminate them discovered outside of time that doesn't come with some other downside.


Okay and...3: you get to brag that it's old and mark up the price. There are diminishing returns for both 1 and 2 as more time passes.

And no, it doesn't apply to everything. It depends on what's in the alcohol in the first place and whether you want that particular drink picking up flavors from its container.

Edit for spelling.


Second edit due to number of replies:  Sorry y'all, I really should have said something like ""two desirable things"" or ""two main things good for the taste"".   There *is* more going on, significantly the evaporation several have mentioned and a small reduction in ABV that comes with it. I was trying to describe the two main reasons aging improves taste/desirability as opposed to things incidental to that effort like the evaporation loss."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do browsers sometimes drain a lot of RAM until rebooted?,"People in this thread keep mentioning memory leaks. This explanation is wrong.

Browsers try to keep a copy of things you might need prepared in advance. Often if a browser feels snappy, it's because rather than waiting for the thing you asked for to be downloaded of the internet, they kept a copy from the last time you asked for it. In fact, for extra snappyness, they keep it in RAM.

Browsers like chrome assume that they are the main thing you do on your computer, and will shamelessly take up more and more memory on the off-chance that you ask for something they are keeping. It gives them that quick snappy feel, but also makes them memory intensive."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why is it considered unhealthy if someone is overweight even if all their blood tests, blood pressure, etc. all come back at healthy levels?","When a person gains weight their skeleton and major organs aren't designed to grow to keep up with the excess weight.  Carrying extra weight around all day puts extra strain on joints and can cause aches and pain. Eventually the extra weight gives organs more work than they can handle and either the body's cells suffer because there are too many cells for the organs to take care of, or the organs themselves suffer due to overwork.

Imagine a city with 100 people living in it.  That city has things like a fire department, a water treatment plant, a sewage system, and a power plant.  Sometimes the city sometimes has a big parade and 50 extra people come; all the city's systems can handle this for a short time (the fire department works an extra shift, the power plant uses backup generators, etc.), but afterwards there's a rest (in this analogy, this is what happens when you exercise hard, or when you're sick -- all your organs have to work harder).  If those extra 50 people came and lived in the city full time, eventually the sewage system and water treatment facility would be overwhelmed and people would get dirty water, the firemen would all be exhausted because they were working non-stop and eventually they would all be so tired that a fire might be totally missed, the powerplant couldn't keep up with peak hours and there would be blackouts."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If the Universe is about 13.7 billion years old, and the diameter of the observable universe is 93 billion light years, how can it be that wide if the universe isn't even old enough to let light travel that far that quickly?","Imagine the universe is a balloon that is slowly inflating, now imagine your beam of light is an ant crawling along it's surface.  


Lets say the ant moves 10 inches in some frame of time, and the balloon also expands to twice its size in that same time, the ant will be more than 10 inches away from where it started from.   


If you ignore the expansion of the universe - the ant appears to be moving faster than it should be able to move.  
If you consider that expansion though, the ant isn't moving any faster or slower... the space around the ant is moving away from it.  


It's the same deal with light in space, the space between us and that light has expanded, which makes the distance between us and that light farther than the light itself has actually travelled."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do video games detect if they're pirated?,"There are a bunch of different methods that have been used:

* Non-standard formatting. This was most common back in the days of cartridges, where each console had its own unique hardware. This includes special hardware that isn't strictly required, but makes it easier to detect attempts to copy the device.
* Corrupt files. This was common for games distributed on both floppy and CD. The basic idea is to intentionally put a corrupted file on the disk, such that standard software either fails to read it, or cannot reproduce it during a copy. The software then checks to make sure this corruption matches exactly.
* Server connections. This is among the most common method today. Basically, your product gets registered with a central server, and the software connects to the server to check if it is valid. Generally, this will include embedding an encrypted product key somewhere in the software.
* Encryption. Its possible to make hardware such that you can encrypt the game so its only playable on that specific hardware. While the user could copy their own version, it will fail to run on anybody else's hardware. As this requires each copy be customized for each user, it requires digital distribution and can only work if the distributor controls the hardware. As such, it tends to be very rarely used.
* Intentionally releasing a ""pirated"" version. In doing so, its possible for the company to get the jump on actual pirated copies, while making the version they released inferior in some way. If done right, the vast majority of pirates will find this version over a normal version. As it is a bit tricky to manage, this tends to be a less common method.

Naturally, most companies try to keep their copy prevention methods secret as a form of security in obscurity. Its easier to bypass the security if its publicly known how its done. As such, there are probably other methods that have been used."

English spelling is entirely a product of its history. In the middle ages, there were general conventions for how to spell words, but nothing was standardized. With the invention of the printing press, all this non standard spelling became frozen in time. Spelling reflects both etymology and how words were pronounced in the 1400s and 1500s.

I've looked up the etymologies for the two words in question. *Nipple* seems to be germanic in origin, likely coming from the Old English word *neb*---which meant ""the beak or bill of a bird""---where *neble* was the diminutive (read: cutesy) form. Since this was an Old English word, scribes simply would have written it roughly how it was pronounced, until the printing press froze the (edit: *most common*) spelling.

*Triple* comes from Latin *triplus* by way of Old French, and entered the language in the 1400s. Since it was a loan word, the spelling would have originally been similar to the French spelling. Since it entered the language in the 1400s, this spelling became frozen in time.

There are fun little quirks like this all throughout English.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why have it taken so long to prosecute former Nazi's, that we still see cases popping up today?","There are a few reasons.  A lot of former Nazis hid their identities and escaped to countries where they were not easy to identify, such as Argentina.  However, the main reason for the recent prosecutions is that Germany changed what had to be proven to convict someone.  Between 1949 and 1985, there were 200,000 investigations and 120,000 indictments of former Nazis in Germany, but less than 7,000 convictions.  Those convictions required that a prosecutor prove a person's role in a specific murder. 

The German government changed its policy on Nazi war criminals around the year 2000, allowing prosecutions of Nazis who served in death camps or mobile killing units, based on their service alone, and not their role in any specific murder.  As a result, former Nazis would couldn't be convicted before can be convicted now.  

So a number of people who were investigated and cleared are now being prosecuted because of this lower burden of proof.  As far as identifying former Nazis who escaped, that happens at an increasingly less frequent rate because the majority have died at this point."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do we have inflation at all?,"ELI5 disclaimer!

Because the number of dollars out there does not perfectly match the GDP at all times.

As the economy increases, if the number of dollars did not increase the dollars would actually start to be worth more. This is deflation, which we have learned is actually really bad for the economy, because if your money is worth more tomorrow or next year, you are much less likely to spend it today. Keep repeating that forever and you have a problem.

So this is why the government has policies in place to keep the dollar growth slightly (but not too much) inflationary. So that you are not penalized for spending your money. Which is what they want, as they get to tax money as it changes hands.

As for your grandparents savings, had they put it into an investment, that had a nominal interest rate, then the value would have stayed relatively the same (or maybe even better) as the years went on. I am sorry they didn't know to do this. Bank accounts are terrible places to store money long term."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: if procreating with close relatives causes dangerous mutations and increased risks of disease, how did isolated groups of humans deal with it?","Inbreeding doesn't cause mutations, it just makes it easier for those mutations to express themselves.

Simplified explanation:

Normally you get one copy of your genes from your father and another copy from your mother.

If one of those two copies contains an error your still have the other one.

If your mother and your father are sibling and inherited the faulty copy from the same parent. You may get the broken plan from both your parents and no clean unbroken copy.

In a group of closely related humans that keep having children with each other birth defects and genetic diseases thus become more common. 

Of course populations can still survive with this handicap. Individuals not so much, but the group as a whole yes.

The ones with the biggest issues simply die and do not get to have children of their own.

We use the Glasgow Coma Scale to judge whether someone is in a coma. It measures things like responses to pain and whether someone can open their eyes. A score of 8 or lower indicates someone is officially ""in a coma"", though the typical ""laying in bed totally non responsive"" imagery of a coma is usually indicative of a very low score on the Glasgow Coma Scale.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do internet domains work? Who are you paying?,"My team built the domain registrar at Squarespace (I'm no longer there.) There are two business entities involved in buying a domain.

The first is the “registrar”. These are companies like Godaddy. Registrars are the Expedia of domains. Their job is to handle all of the retail transactions with customers, collect payments, and reserve domains on behalf of their customers. Registrars don’t own any domains themselves, rather, they connect to domain wholesalers and broker the sale, and do support along the way. For this, they take a fee.

Since registrars don’t actually own any domains, who does? These are called (confusingly) “registries.” One registry owns all .com domains. Another owns all .net. Another owns .dev. And so on. Registries are domain wholesalers, and they only sell to customers via registrars. Registries keep track of registrations, renewals, DNS, and other technical and administrative tasks for their domain. They also take a fee.

There is an organization (not a government organization, just a private entity) called ICANN. They also take a fee. You can apply to become “accredited” by them to sell domains. This means agreeing to an aide by certain rules, both technical and administrative, to sell domains. Accredited registries will only work with accredited registrars. ICANN generally wants customers to have a uniform experience buying domains, so by buying accredited domains, you can be pretty confident that your domain will work as advertised."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why are lakes names some times “Name Lake” and other times “Lake Name”?,"In many cases, the order of the name doesn’t  meaning anything — it’s just random. *Generally* speaking, however, most lakes in the U.S. follow the pattern “Lake [Proper Noun]” or “[Adjective] Lake.”

So if you see, for example, *Lake Deer*, chances are it’s named after a person with the last name Deer. If you see *Deer Lake*, on the other hand, it probably got that name because there were/are lots of deer living around it. 

On a side note, it’s usually larger lakes that have a name like *Lake Name*, and smaller lakes with names of the form *Name Lake.* This isn’t intentional — it’s just more common to formally name the largest lakes after an important person or place."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why are larger (house, car) rechargeable batteries specified in (k)Wh but smaller batteries (laptop, smartphone) are specified in (m)Ah?","Tradition of using mAh for one and progress of using proper unit of energy for the other. Also lying to customers.

mAh is not a unit of battery capacity. If you see a battery with 200 mAh and another battery with 300 mAh this is not enough information to say which one has bigger capacity.  
To get the capacity from mAh you need to multiply it by the voltage.  
A 200 mAh battery with 10 V output has capacity of 200\*10 = 2000 mWh.  
A 300 mAh battery with 5 V output has capacity of 300\*5= 1500 mWh.

If you compare batteries of same type (same voltage) then mAh is enough to compare them with. But in general it is useless number on its own.  

For cheap electronics a big part is also using this nonsense to lie to the consumer because it allows listing big numbers for the product that do not mean anything. So if any product that is not just a bare battery lists its capacity in mAh you can usually completely disregard that number as worthless marketing blubber.   
For example a quick check on battery bank listings on a single shop I found these two:  

* Product 1: Advertised as 30000 mAh. Actual capacity 111 Wh.  
* Product 2: Advertised as 26000 mAh. Actual capacity 288 Wh.
* Many products that do not list their Wh capacity at all.

For general batteries the voltages can be whatever depending on the battery construction. And there may be circuits to step the voltage up or down. So using real unit of capacity is the only proper way to label them."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why do we have 4 ‘rock’ planets in a row then 4 ‘gas’ planets in a row?,"Our solar system formed as a massive protosolar disk of spinning gas and dust. Gravity pulled light gasses into the center - eventually, the gravitational pressure and gas density was enough to initiate hydrogen fusion, and the protostar became the sun. Dust was slowly accumulating into rocks and asteroids, and eventually the core of the rocky planets, and the gas giants. Meanwhile, the solar wind from the new star was now pushing light elements and molecules (hydrogen and water) away from the sun. This left the materials for primarily rocky planets in the inner solar system, and pushed the materials for gas giants out beyond the orbit of Mars. Earth was later bombarded with icy comets, which is how we have so much water. 
 
This is the commonly accepted model of our solar systems formation. There are other proposed models that have the gas giants forming close in and migrating to the outer solar system later."

explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: Why shouldn’t you put home made ceramics (a mug, for example) through the dishwasher? If they can withstand the heat of a kiln, surely a dishwasher is fine?","Potter here...  

This is a complicated subject. Well-made and tested homemade ceramics can go through the dishwasher just fine.  However, a dishwasher is a very rough environment.   Most potters, who recommend handwashing only, do so because the pot is less likely to get banged around.  Stress cracks, formed by banging against another pot in the dishwasher, can cause the entire pot to crack when hot liquid is poured into it, not to mention chips and dings to the rim.   

Other considerations:  Dishwasher detergent is very basic.   If the glaze is not tested for basic conditions (rare in foods) a dishwasher can cause the glaze to fade over time.  Also, there are certain finishes, such as gold enamel, that will fade badly in the dishwasher.    Finally, if the clay body is not fired to low absorption, a dishwasher can cause water absorption in the clay, which can cause mold and excessive heating in the microwave.

So, for dishwasher, microwave safe ceramics, the clay body and the glaze need to be tested together for fading under both acid and basic condition, no enamels applied, and the clay body should be fired high enough to ensure a low absorption.   It is highly recommended that each clay body be tested by the potter prior to use.  It's not uncommon for manufacturers to label a clay cone 6-cone 10 when the clay is not really suitable for functional use when fired to cone 6.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do planes ""dip"" right after takeoff before they climb to cruising altitude?","
When you take off, you will initially be pitched up fairly steeply (15-20 degrees) because the first objective after the take off is to gain altitude and clear any obstacles/terrain immediately surrounding the airport in case of an engine failure.

Large airplanes use flaps/slats on the wings to increase lift and shorten the length of runway they need to take off. After you are safely away from the ground, these need to be retracted, and in order to retract them, the airplane needs to gain airspeed. That's because additional airspeed will make up the lift lost by retracting flaps. 

So once you gain some altitude, you will briefly nose over to trade climb rate for more airspeed. This happens at whatever ""acceleration altitude"" has been prescribed by your company for your airplane at that airport, usually ~600-1000ft above ground (~30 seconds after takeoff). As the airplane accelerates and after the flaps are retracted, you will continue your climb again. This temporary reduction in climb rate might be what you are feeling.

This will happen again at 10000ft above sea level (in the US at least), when the airplane will level off to accelerate even more before continuing to climb to cruise altitude."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why can bands play for hours often utilizing different instruments without ever looking at sheet music, but orchestra musicians always read from sheet music?","As a musician familiar in both worlds, the real reason is that orchestras give their musicians very very very little time to rehearse/prepare (which is why you have to be ***extremely fucking good*** to be in one, you have to sight read like an absolute demon), so they may only have had one or two rehearsals as a group prior to performing, and maybe a week or two of preparation/practice on their own. 

Popular music acts are playing music they wrote and have had months to familiarize themselves with. If you played the same thing for six months straight you'll have it memorized within about six weeks at the most (and that's for something pretty complicated).

One thing I'll note is that people are saying classical/orchestral music is more complex, and popular music has a good amount of improvisation. While this is certainly true on average, it varies heavily by genre. One, you don't get to improvise much in modern pop music (i.e., The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, whatever). You don't hear improvised guitar solos in Ariana Grande songs, yet none of them are reading from sheet music. In their case, the music isn't particularly complex, so memorization isn't as much of a barrier.

On the other end of the spectrum, you have extremely complex rock/metal/jazz/whatever where the musicians still have it memorized and don't read from sheet music on stage despite its complexity. [Jazz fusion is one of the more show-off-y versions of this.](https://youtube.com/shorts/vmWRjZd-j1w?si=Sew6WawZyXH64YWm) Memorization is certainly a barrier here, so it's probably no surprise to hear all those guys have graduate degrees in music."

With enough heat and oxygen the vaporized wax will completely oxidize (combine with oxygen) and the majority of the resulting chemicals will be invisible gasses. If there's not enough oxygen, or not enough heat, then the wax will only partially oxidize, and the wick will start to burn as well.

Plus, it now has a MASSIVE amount of surface area that it's holding onto.

Properly done, the wood will break before the glue fails. You can glue things incorrectly and have only a surface bond, which can be ok, but can be pried apart by hand.

An additional feature, you can achieve similar effects to the above with epoxy and other glues, is that it dries transparent, and can also be found in forms that dry close to the colour of the wood, making it less obvious a repair was done or the wood was glued."

Mold, like other fungi, have something called mycelium. What you see as a mushroom or mold is part of a much larger organism, and are called ""fruiting bodies.""

(Like how they found who started the ebola outbreak in 2014),"First things first, Patient Zero was one guy, a specific patient who was “credited” with being the index case for HIV/AIDS. The general term for the first officially recorded case of a novel disease is “index case”, and it isn’t as big of a deal as movies often imply. It *is* helpful to trace the source of something like Ebola back to an animal reservoir, and from an epidemiological perspective you want to be sure that you’re at the end of the chain of infection. 

In reality though you rarely know for sure who the index patient was overall or for a given outbreak, so it ends up being a bit de facto “who did health authorities notice first?” The Index Case is more of a result for how contact tracing and other epidemiological techniques work in practice than some sort of holy grail."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why can’t spam call centers be automatically shut down?,"Most of the spam call centers originate in countries where the governments don't _really_ care all that much.  For example, a good number of them are in smaller cities in India, where the politicians are willing to turn a blind eye for the right price (and so long as they don't go around scamming Indians).

From there, the call centers are just another overseas call.  There are a number of _legitimate_ call centers in foreign countries, so looking to block the scam ones is a needle in a stack of needles.  Its a ton of effort for the phone company with little actual benefit to them."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are lighthouses still necessary?,"It's an excellent safety measure - a second data point, a way to calibrate and verify whatever you're using to navigate.

If you see a lighthouse you weren't expecting, or Don't see one you were expecting, that's your warning that something is wrong and you might not be where you think you are.  ...and it tells you this from line of sight, without crashing into anything, or getting lost at sea.

When scammers use [special characters that make a fake login portal look real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack), or [crafty javascript with fake popup windows](https://streamable.com/j1k10), then *you* might fall for it, but the password manager will only autofill your information on the actual website."

explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why do computer operating systems have lots of viruses and phone operating systems don't?,"The boring answer is that people are used to doing whatever they want with their computers, so computers (typically) have a lot less limitations.

Phones are, for a lot of reasons, more ""tightened up"" and get away with it because people actually accept their limitations.

The limitations give viruses fewer entry points that can be attacked, and for that reason they are perceived as more safe.

In reality, the difficulty in getting a virus into a phone also makes it more difficult for a user to know that there is a virus in it, so this is a double edged sword..."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5: Why are soup/food cans so much more robust than beverage cans, even though both cans are made to withstand the pressure of being stacked vertically for shipping and storage?","Soda cans are pressurized, and a lot of their strength comes from that fact. Much like an inflated balloon can hold its shape, and a deflated one can’t. If one takes an intact can, a person can readily stand on it without issue. Open the can and release the pressure, and the can will crumple under the same weight. 

Soup cans usually have foods where pressurizing doesn’t make sense, either because the can needs a wide opening or because the food shouldn’t be fizzy. So therefore the can itself needs to take the weight without depending on internal pressure to keep it rigid."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: why does ̸̢̛̞̱͓Z̵̪͙͊̎̌ä̷̳͕̋̚l̵͉̙̓͘ͅg̴̫̠̑̈͜o̴̻͛ text look the way it does?,"Some letters can be changed with accents. For example: e can be  è, é, ê, ë, etc.

How do computers store letters with accents?

There are two main ways.

1. Store a copy of every letter with every accent combination. Or
2. Store the letters and accents separately.

Because there are lots of different letters and lots of different accents, it is easier for computers to store them separately. Think of letters as little Lego figures, and accents as their hats. You have a box of figures, a box of hats, and you can combine them however you like.

What happens if you put too many hats on your Lego figure? It starts to look a bit silly.

With computer text, you can take an English letter, and then add as many accents as you want to it. Some accents go at the top like É. Some go at the bottom like Ç.

Just like a tower of Lego, it is possible to keep adding accents on to letters. And that gives you the ""Zalgo"" effect."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How does raising wages worsen inflation ?,"In theory yes. But the opposite can also lead to inflation.

Raising wages causes inflation by companies raising prices because the metric to calculate the price of a product changes when consumers get richer, namely the ""how much are they willing to spend"" metric. If the customer is willing to spend more, charge more. Thus, inflation rises.

However, lowering wages causes inflation because people are buying less, and therefore companies are selling less, so therefore have to raise prices to break even. Of course there are other things they can do like the infamous ""shrinkflation"", wherein the price remains the same, but the size of the product decreases. 

Basically, it's a bit rough and nebulous... unless either reach a critical level, there is no point worrying about whether wages are going to cause inflation, because in all likeliness, they're probably not...

A great example is *right now*. The economy is in a very weird position that it hasn't really been in before. Obviously we are in a period of high inflation. The trick governments around the world use is to tighten money through measures like raising interest rates and an easing of supply shortages to start. This round of inflation is mostly due shortages (chips, cars, labor, some commodities). If that doesn’t work then a recession will be engineered to dampen (or reverse) wage growth, ease demand, and in effect reset the economy. Historically periods of high growth lead to inflation and the only tried and true way to stop it has been to cool off the demand side through some form of austerity.

The problem is, wage growth has been stagnant for at least a decade... And austerity has been in place for many people already... And shortages are mostly gone, but prices have not gone down... so there is ""nothing to reign in""... It's already at the lowest point it can go, and we're still inflating... So governments around the world are basically asking people to accept a  massive L for yet another decade, while coincidentally corporations are raking in massive profits. Basically, you can't apply austerity to people who already have the austerity debuff... *That* causes lots of problems.

Lots of governments ignored this though, and decided to press on with Austerity 2.0 (or even 3.0+ in some countries) making people poorer, angrier, and more radical. Which sounds like ""okay, this sucks for everyone. But it could be a necessary evil, right?"" Well, maybe... But then you realize that pretty much all corporations are posting record profits... The rich are certainly getting richer. So why aren't we?

What I'm *trying* to say is, the usual tricks governments have isn't going to work, because the people they do the trick on are already milked dry. Attention has turned to the greed of corporations as being the cause of the inflation, and of course, politicians are hesitant to act and punish the rich and powerful... Because they're rich and powerful... And of course, every day people are gaslit into advocating for faceless billionaires because... ???? So there isn't even a majority national feeling anywhere that greed needs to be reigned in..."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is asbestos so much more dangerous than other 'sharp' dusts like fibreglass?,"Asbestos is dangerous because the fibers mechanically damage the machinery of your cells. The fibers are so small that the smallest fibers can get inside your cells and tangle with the DNA causing replication errors during cell division. These errors can greatly increase the rates of cancer. 

As to why asbestos is more dangerous, its crystal structure gives it the behavior that as it is crushed it fractures along the same planes preferentially (how is not really ELi5). This means small needles, become smaller needles of the same length, become nanoscale needles of the same length. It doesn't break in the way other materials would into chunks lengthwise. Asbestos is also extremely soft which makes production of the tiniest shards a lot easier than other materials."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: what causes “the spins”? Or, rather the feeling of spinning while intoxicated; especially on THC and alcohol at the same time?","Your body has three ways of measuring position and movement.

Your inner ear is coated in little hairs that sense the movement of fluid. Your eyes can see what's going on. And your body can feel through touch.

With three systems, your brain is normally pretty happy as long as two of them agree. If you close your eyes, the other two systems still know what's going on so everything is still good.

As others have said alcohol messes with your inner ear system. While your eyes are open your eyes and touch both still know what's going on so you don't feel too bad.

When you're lying in bed and close your eyes, you now only have one working system, touch. Your eyes are telling your brain nothing, so it ignores them. Touch is telling your brain that you're lying on your back. Your inner ear is telling your brain you're on a rollercoaster, so that gets fed into the calculation and you feel like you're spinning.

That's also the reason why you feel mostly fine when your eyes are open, and horrible when you close them."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5 how can insects survive a slap from humans, a creature that's gigantic compared to them","They are very small and light. At their size, the stuff they're made of is strong compared to the forces it needs to withstand (like their own inertia). This means that they're more likely to bounce off than break.

It's sort of like comparing a wooden locket and a wooden house being hit by a wrecking ball. The wooden locket will bounce off, maybe getting a few chips as it hits the ground. The wooden house gets obliterated.

That's because very little of the wrecking balls energy got delivered to the locker before it harmlessly bounced, it was very easy to move. Meanwhile the large house's own inertia prevented it from just moving, while the material it was made of wasn't strong enough to withstand the force that WOULD move it. So it caved in instead."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why aren't there mountains that are 10 or 15 miles high on Earth?,"Also, its not just gravity.  Another factor has to do with how we measure elevation on Mars.  Earth's zero elevation is sea level.  Mars has no sea level.  In order to have a scientific reference, Mars's zero elevation datum was chosen to be the elevation where the atmospheric pressure on Mars was at the triple point of water.  That is where the atmospheric pressure is 610Pa.  By comparison, Earth's atmospheric pressure as sea level is 101,000Pa.  Mars's lowest elevation is 4.4 miles below Martian zero elevation,  not nearly as as far below the zero elevation as earth's oceans.  When you start your yardsticks at different spots, you get different measurements."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do babies learn a language when they are not taught it in a structured manner?,"Babies have very plastic brains and they learn through a process called ""Schema"" which we actually still use throughout development. Babies learn that certain things are similar and that sounds make other people respond to their needs so they use them. This is why, for instance, a child becomes upset when you bring them their ball when they are demanding their ball. Because they don't recognize that ""ball"" means ball they think ""ball"" means ""thing I play with"" and what they ACTUALLY want is their teddy bear. This is also why small children might refer to every man as ""daddy"" because that just means ""not mama"" to them."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why does a camera have to flash and time it perfectly when it takes a picture? Can't the light just stay on?,"It is of course possible to take a photo using continuous bright lights, and this is often done. For example in a professional photoshoot there will be lots of lights involved, or when photographing performers who would be distracted by a flash photographers may carry dedicated lights.

The price of this is that for a sufficiently bright light you need a large battery, and at least historically a bulb would also get hot and so need to be large to allow heat dissipation. A flash gets round this because it is only on for a tiny moment. The total amount of energy used per photo is therefore small, despite the light being extremely bright."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: When we sleep, spinal fluid washes waste from our brain. What exactly is ""waste"" in the brain?","The ""waste"" in our brain is a protein, specifically a protein called ""beta-amyloid"".

If you don't get proper amounts of sleep,  cerebrospinal fluid is unable to wash the beta-amyloid proteins from the brain. Source: https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-sleep-clears-brain


More research is being done on the importance of this ""washing"" mechanism that happens during sleep. They've also found a new way to check for Lewy body diseases (such as Lewy body dementia) by sampling cerebrospinal fluid for those proteins. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2965495/


Lewy body diseases are caused by a protein called ""alpha-synuclein"". These proteins may also be ""washed"" away during sleep and end up in our cerebrospinal fluid which is why we're able to check for them with a lumbar puncture.


Research is still being done in this area so we don't have a whole picture idea of what's actually going on. There may be more proteins and ""waste"" being ""washed"" away but scientists will have to test for each individual protein/waste."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how people on opposite sides of the earth can play video games together seemlessly when these games require split second actions,"Something I haven’t seen mentioned is that beyond internet speed, game developers use various tricks to help as much as possible. 

One thing is that most games transmit the bare minimum required amount of information to the server. Your system isn’t giving the server a full rundown of everything you’re seeing in-game; it’s strictly telling it your actions, and it’s able to describe those actions in an extremely efficient shorthand. 

The second thing is that there is some amount of predictive calculations that these games can do ahead of time before you commit some action. Not enough to predict the future of everything you’ll do, just enough to kind of get a head start, in between your direct inputs. It’s kind of just like filling in the blanks or finishing someone’s sentences. This can further cut down on the amount of raw data that needs to be transmitted."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Okay, so I understand that the number of protons in an atom defines the element. But why are there only 118 of them? Can't we keep on adding protons to an atom to create new elements?","We can but those elements would be unstable and fall apart almost immediately. Bismuth (83) is the last truly stable element (more precisely, the last element with at least one truly stable isotope). The heavier you go after that, the faster your elements fall apart on their own, i.e. go through nuclear (radioactive) decay.

Edit: actually lead (82) is the last stable element, bismuth just has a really, really long half-life."
explainlikeimfive,eli5 why do wine bottles do that little indent at the bottom of the bottle,"There’s two answers to this. First historically wine bottles were made by glass blowers, and the process commonly used happens to create the bump - there’s a work-holding rod used that causes it. Second, this created a stable ring of contact on the table. Whereas if you tried to create a flat bottom, there’s a chance it bows outward instead, which wouldn’t stand properly on a table. So this design lasted.

There’s also two addendum to this answer. These days we can create flat bottomed (or slightly convex bottomed) bottles by machine reliably. But we still keep the wine bottle shape, mostly by tradition. If you go to a restaurant the waiter holds bottles for the pour by inserting their thumb into the punt - it looks elegant. Also wine enthusiasts sometimes associate a larger punt with a higher quality of wine - this is obviously false, as the glass bottle shape does not causally influence the quality of the liquid within; however this is believed and may actually indicate some mild correlation. I haven’t done/read studies on this - just anecdotal sampling and talking to other enthusiasts and makers. Some winemakers will tell you they also subscribe to this and thus use a deeper punt if they believe their wine to be premium.

And a last note of comment - the design for a thing is not always easy to explain with a “why”. There’s functional, historical, and incidental explanations. I don’t think any of the other explanations in this thread are wrong - they just explain from a different angle. eg why do we use USB for electronics chargers or why plastic bags come with tabs?"

For a hundred million years, there was tremendous pressure to breed and no accurate way to simulate the image of a ready and willing partner. If you saw a sexy specimen in a provocative position, they were definitely real and almost certainly making an invitation. Once your eyes have seen it, your brain predicts the next part and tells the rest of your body to get ready with a rush of hormones, initiating a physical response in the pants region. This specific hardware, linking the sight, scent, sound, taste, or touch of a willing partner to your genitals is some of the oldest, simplest hardware in your brain.

explainlikeimfive,eli5: What does mindfulness mean? I see it in every mental health article but I don't understand it,"Mindfulness is about trying to stay in the moment, to focus on what's happening now. The goal is to bring more awareness or enjoyment of your daily life, instead of getting lost in thought all the time or losing control to your emotions.

Some simple examples: 

When petting your cat, *pet the cat*-- focus on the enjoyment of their soft fur and their cute purring. Notice their feeling of their skin, muscles and bones under the fur-- get curious. Notice how they close their eyes and move their little nose. *Notice how you feel in the moment.* Acknowledge those feelings.

When eating breakfast, are you focusing on enjoying the breakfast or are you staring at your phone instead (like I am now)? This can be partially salient when eating other meals. Are you just snarfing down the whole meal, or are you taking the time to enjoy the flavor, texture and sensation of every bite? Can you focus on any of the subtle flavors? Can you identify the ingredients that might have changed the flavors? All of this should bring more enjoyment to your meal.

When driving down the street, did you notice another driver who pissed you off? Are you feeling angry? *Acknowledge that feeling*-- acknowledgment will give you more control over your anger and will help you to recognize what's happening. If you can, ""step out"" of your anger and examine it-- what made you angry? How does it feel? It's okay to be angry-- anger is part of the human condition. But you want to be in control of your anger. Recognizing how you feel at any moment is the essence of mindfulness.

When brushing your teeth, *brush your teeth* instead of getting lost in thought. Notice each tooth and gum, and clean each one. Are any parts particularly sensitive? Perhaps clean them a bit more for the next several bushings. The point here: *do one thing at a time*. Focus.

In terms of mental health, mindfulness a strategy to try to enjoy what's happening now. It's a strategy to avoid obsessing over events that have already happened that we cannot change, or worrying too much over events in the future that have not happened yet. This worrying can replay over and over in your mind and can interfere with what you are doing now. We can learn from the past, but we can't go back to change it. We cannot change the future yet, but we can when it becomes ""now"". These obsessive states can feel like a dream. During one these obsessive states, we will ""wake up""-- at that point you can intentionally make a decision to acknowledge, without guilt or shame, that you were perseverating and instead return your focus on whatever is happening now-- this is the essence of ""mindfulness"". 

As someone who suffers from major anxiety, this perseverating can occur for days at a time, or even weeks or years. It means that I might have missed out on many wonderful events that are happening around me now. I might spend so much time preparing and over preparing for the future that I miss out on things now, like my kids or the meal that I'm enjoying now. Mindfulness, including mindfulness meditation, as well as anxiety meds have helped me with this anxiety."

Experiment to show a similar effect: invert a clear glass over some water push the glass underwater, there eill be an air pocket in side.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are electrical outlets in industrial settings installed ‘upside-down’ with the ground at the top?,"The circular hole is the ground hole. Nearly always, this has no voltage. With that hole at the top, if the plug starts to dislodge, the ground will peek out the most. This is safest if something were to get caught on the plug, another cord for example. This would then only be in contact with the ground. Also, if someone were to step on a cord, the ground comes out as the other prongs are forced into their slots and not the other way around. 

In industrial settings, plugging things in and unplugging them and moving them is much more common than a residential setting. Residential plugs are typically set and then forgotten. In newer residential spots, you may many times see the outlets now in this upside down arrangement. One final note, typically in a room, the one upside down outlet is the one activated by the wall switch."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does classical music (at least from the past) lack drums?,"While there are some counterexamples, the reason we don’t associate classical music with percussion is that it largely grew out of sacral music, which was primarily vocal in tradition — it was sung in churches.

Percussion, on the other hand, would have been largely associated with military and folk music."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: why are 11 and 12 called eleven ant twelve and not oneteen and twoteen?,"Those terms come from the Old English words endleofan and twelf. This comes from an earlier construction of ainlif and twalif where they are referring to a remainder, like saying ""ten and one"" or ""ten and two"".

Why stop at just eleven and twelve? This is probably due to counting up to a dozen being all that the typical person would be required to do, and so terms used commonly would stop there. Contributing to this may be that a way of counting on one's fingers was to use the thumb to point at each joint of the fingers of one hand. Each of the four fingers has three joints, adding up to twelve.

Twelve also has more factors than ten which could explain it being commonly used. Ten has only 1, 2, 5, and 10 as factors, while twelve has 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. If you want to easily divide something evenly then starting from twelve is more convenient than ten."

I'd tell the creditor that they were facing bankruptcy, and that I was able to pay $2000 in a lump sum now to completely cancel the debt. Otherwise we'd start missing payments and who knows what would happen. They might make a counter offer of $3000 and maybe I'd take it or I'd say $2000 was our maximum budget. In the end I think I cleared some $20k in debts for about $8k. I don't know what it did to their credit, but it got them out of a downward spiral. I was then able to set them up on a budget with a debit card that only had free spending money on it (bills were paid out before money went to the debit accoutn) and didn't do overdraft. They didn't love it, but it kept them from ending up on the street."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is there so much Oil in the Middle East?,"You’re not thinking back nearly far enough in time.

The modern desert covering the Arabian peninsula is like the past 2 minutes of your life vs what happened years ago when you were 3 years old.   The organic material that formed the oil deposits are hundreds of millions years old.   They were ancient when dinosaurs were still walking around the earth.

FYI the Middle East doesn’t have the most oil of any place on earth.   They just have the most “*easy to get to, high grade*” oil.

There are tons of other options but cost more to drill.  Venezuela has more than Saudi but theirs is low grade. Texas and North Dakota have a lot of high grade but expensive to extract oil.   And there are vast areas of the earth that haven’t been explored for potential oil yet."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how do pharmacies work? Do they just have every kind of medication at all time? How is a prescription ready within an hour?,"General yes, pharmacies will keep enough of the more commonly requested medications in stock so that most prescriptions can be filled the same day.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What exactly about the tiktok app makes it Chinese spyware? Has it been proven it can do something?,"It's not in a great spot, I'll put it that way.

To start off, the Chinese government has a habit and history of having back doors into a lot of products made by companies that have their home there. For example, Huawei, a company known for phones and servers was ~~discovered a a few years back to have been putting gov. back doors into server chips used by American companies.~~ Under heavy suspicion by American companies and others for having backdoor in their systems after various security flaws were found.

On top of that, most analysis of the app itself have set off quite a few red flags, such as requiring way more security permissions than it should need, their Terms of Service requiring you to allow them to ""build a full profile,"" on you including who you interact with and every bit of info about you, and IIRC was found to be uploading keystrokes or copied clipboard data at frequent intervals, which is a great way to get someone's passwords and/or other sensitive data.

So we're at the point of ""it's doing a lot of weird shit that it shouldn't be, but we can't *prove* it's doing anything malicious with it... yet.""

EDIT: Because I'm seeing it here **a lot** I'm going to clear this up. No, this is not the same thing as Google, Instagram, Facebook, etc. in the US. Here in the US (and most western countries) we not only have privacy laws that protect us from certain breaches, but more importantly the government and company are two separate entities, and are even frequently at each-other's throats. While all those companies certainly collect data, they are *not* responsible for handing it directly to their government outside of official process such as warrants and subpoenas. In China it's the opposite, companies over a certain size are required to by law to allow the government to access and have direct control over large sections of the companies operations. The problem worsens when we remember that China isn't really the best of friends with a lot of western nations, and giving *them specifically* control over what large numbers of western people (especially youth) see and interact with is not great for national security. Should you still always keep privacy in mind with the western companies? Absolutely, but the two issues are worlds apart.

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 why do bees create hexagonal honeycombs?,"The short answer is that they don't. Bees have round bodies with wax producing glands along their abdomens. They secrete the wax to produce round, tubular cells. When those cells get forced together, they flatten out into hexagons because that is the most efficient arrangement. You could try it out yourself with poker chips or marbles or tuna cans. The important thing is that you have a bunch of circles that are the same size. If you try to pack them into a frame, maybe the bottom of a shoebox, they can be aligned in any pattern you like. You could pack them as a square grid, but if you press against the edges of the grid, you will force the circles to realign themselves in a tighter packing; they will fall into a hexagonal grid. That's what bees do. They make circles and force them as close to each other as they can. That simple set of rules happens to produce a hexagonal grid"

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 if a bug is flying around your car while you’re driving 60mph on the highway, is the bug flying at 60mph?","Yes, and no.

The bug is flying at a groundspeed of 60, since the car and everything in it is travelling at 60.

However the bugs' airspeed is much lower, because (as long as your windows are closed) the air in the car is also moving at 60, the bug is flying at a regular speed through the air.

Basically the bug doesn't have to fly at 60 to keep up, because the air it's flying in is already going 60.

Exactly the same way you're sitting still and not moving at all, but are going 60 with the car"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does the military keep track of where they've laid out land mines?,"As others have said, it varies. I was trained in the old school ""by the book"" methods back before my country signed the ban on anti-personnel mines:

First, mine fields should ideally be clearly marked and combined with barb wire etc. You're trying to prevent enemies from passing easily, not really trying to kill them, and marking the mine field served this purpose. Of course there are exceptions, but the norm was marking them. The ethical way of using mines, if any use of anti personnel mines can be called ethical, involved using them to delay enemy movement and channel enemies into your prepared kill zones for other weapons.

Next, you would lay the mines out in strings lined up on some fixed marker such as a metal stake hammered into the ground. Take note of the compass course from your marker along the string, plot the marker on a map and note how many mines are laid along heading such and such from the marker. A minefield consists of multiple such lines, at varying headings off my multiple markers. Once the minefield is complete and the map drawn, it should be possible to greatly simplify clearing it up by working along the known strings until you've found the correct number of mines.

Multiple copies of the map are made and sent up the chain of command through various channels, to reduce the chance of all copies being lost.

In the aftermath of a war, mine maps are to be shared with whoever ends up holding the mined area so it can be cleared.

Of course, in real life hardly any nation has used mines by the book. Some conflicts have been worse than others in this regard, the Yugoslav civil wars were notorious in that individual soldiers were given a few mines to place in front of their position with hardly any maps being drawn.
Interestingly, at least on the Western front and in areas that were occupied for some time, the  Nazis in WWII were quite good at keeping records of their minefields. This greatly aided in post war cleanup, in areas for which the records survived. Here in Norway, a large number of German soldiers voluntarily stayed for a year or so after the war ended as they were paid by Norway to clear up their own minefields. Paid quite well by the standards of the time, since the work was dangerous. That's why we have very few land mine incidents in Norway despite extensive German mining during the occupation, they kept good records and then did a thorough job of clearing up everything."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why can we touch both sides of AA/AAA batteries?,"You're not supposed to connect the contacts because it will lead to a short circuit, which can end up overheating and damaging the battery, or the wire that connects it.

But your body has a very high resistance, so touching both poles doesn't actually create a short circuit. You get a small amount of current flowing, bht because of the low voltage of a AA and your bodies high resistance it's in the order of a few micro amps, which is virtually nothing.

For comparison, if you direct short the battery with a very low resistance wire you could draw up to 15 amps of current (about 1 000 000 times more), which will cause the battery and wire to get very hot"
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How is gasoline different from diesel, and why does it damage the car if you put the wrong kind in the tank?","Engines work by making explosions, lots and lots of explosions. That sound you hear when the car is idling? That's 20 or so explosions every second.

These explosions have to be rather precise, and happen at a certain pace. This is achieved in different ways depending on the type of engine, a gasoline engine will ignite the fuel at the right moment using spark plugs, while a diesel engine will compress the fuel until it ignites on its own.

Using the wrong type of fuel will simply cause the explosions to happen at the wrong times (or not at all), and thus screw up the pace."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What are the structural benefits of nails versus claws?,"Nails provide counter pressure to the tips of our fingers. What this means is that they provide some rigidity to our otherwise squishy finger tips which allows us to have fine control and feeling on our finger tips. Nails are not meant to be used for defense, they're vestigial features. The lack of claws allow for more versatile use of the limbs.

Claws on the other hand provide many benefits such as traction in soft surfaces, the ability to climb much easier, and they can be used as weapons. However they're vulnerable to breaking and make the limb less suited to more delicate tasks such as manipulating objects and using the limbs as sensory organs."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How can antimatter exist at all? What amount of math had to be done until someone realized they can create it?,"Antimatter is a poorly understood name. It’s really just “less common”. You’re used to a positive proton and a negative electron but there’s nothing inherent to physics that says those charges and masses have to go together. Antimatter basically just flips those charges so that you have a positive electron and negative proton. Anything you can do with a proton and electron you can do with their antiparticles, such as make atoms, molecules, even whole macroscopic objects and star systems.

As to how we realized it could exist and we could make it, Dirac was thinking about how electrons made sense with relativity. He came up with a useful equation (in that it explained some stuff that was this far observed but not explained and made sense starting from very basic principles) from his thoughts but there was a “problem” with his solution. It worked for negative energies. Working for electrons (the positive solution) could have been enough, but Dirac thought about these solutions and in collaboration with other scientists, concluded that there could be a particle that was like an electron but with positive charge. A few years later Carl David Anderson observed positrons in high energy cosmic rays using a bubble chamber and that was it, we knew they existed and how they were made."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: How are phones waterproof even though the charging port terminals can be exposed to water and not short circuit them?,"As others said ""water resistant"". 

But for the ports, there's a few tricks the most commonly used is to have moisture detection in the port. This is pretty trivial, basically you have a circuit that measures capacitance and if that circuit detects a change in capacitance (there's a big difference between the capacitance of air and water) then the phone will disable the port as well as the ability to charge the phone until that's no longer the case. 

No power in the port means no short circuits. 

Of course, your ports are still vulnerable to corrosion from exposure to water but the components in a phone are decently resistant to corrosion."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 why is the reason why people with Alzheimer’s Disease die?,"Aspiration pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death amongst people with Alzheimer’s disease.

It’s common in late stages of dementia and Alzheimer’s, when the brain starts slipping on how to do basic unconscious functions, like swallowing properly.

Between the old age, weakened physical and mental state, being in a senior care ward where diseases spread easily, etc, a bad cold or fall can be a lot more serious for someone with advanced Alzheimer’s.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do we (Anglophones) use the native language name for some countries (Costa Rica, not Rich Coast), but not for others (Germany, not Deutschland)?","The name a foriegn language has for another country or region is called an exonym (outside name.)

Language is always evolving and sometimes the exonym evolves with the language or is borrowed from another language.

English speakers call Deutschland ""Germany"" because the region near modern day Deutschland was called ""Germania"" in Latin, which means ""where the Germani live."" And Germani basically means ""neighbor"" in Latin.

Roughly similar lineage of people stayed living there and the Latin name wasn't forced to change, so the Latin name stuck in English (and Italian). However, not all Latin influenced languages used the same name. The French call Deutschland ""Allemagne"" from the name Alemmani which were a group of tribes in the area.

Then, you have exonyms that a country or people wants to change. For example, modern Iran used to be called ""Persia"" in English from Greek Persís from Old Persian  name for Cyrus the Great's people. Officially the name was changed to Iran by request of one of Iran's old leaders. Iran is roughly a changed spelling of the old Iranian word ērān which describes a people who lived in the area. However, during WW2, the Allies changed the name on maps back to Persia to avoid confusing it with Iraq, then it changed back to Iran, then some Iranians wanted to bring back the name Persia to connect Iran back to the old glory of the ""Persian Empire"" (and distance from the current Iranian government). Now the name Iran and Persia are both acceptable. So, for political and historic reasons, the exonym for Iran changed multiple times, often because people wanted actively to change the name for various reasons.

So... Exonyms are complex. They are often transmitted across languages and history and thus morph with time like all language. But country names are also political so sometimes exonyms are officially changed by governments or people.

* Redo the HVAC so that each unit can control their own temperature.
* Redo the plumbing because offices tend to have communal toilets and no showers, which obviously doesn't work for apartments. 
* Redo the electricity so that each unit can control their own electrical system, e.g. breaker box in each apartment, and has sufficient electricity for power-intensive appliances (washer/dryers, refrigerators, etc.)
* Redo the actual walls/rooms to accommodate residences."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Japan has been given the okay by UN to dump radioactive waste water into the ocean, but nearby countries are protesting that its unsafe. Is it unsafe? Is it safe?","Your bones are more radioactive than the water that is being released into the ocean by Japan.  Ripping out the skeletons of thousands of people and dumping those into the ocean might be something that some people would find concerning, but that concern wouldn't be over a radioactive hazard.

The reason that other countries are ""concerned"" is because that ""concern"" is a valid reason for restricting Japanese exports under the treaties that establish the World Trade Organization.

Any country that is a member of the WTO (which is basically every country that matters) has to agree not to arbitrarily impose tariffs or other import restrictions on goods from other countries.  There are exceptions to that, one of which is because goods from another country pose a health or safety risk.

The *vast* majority of environmental or health complaints that countries make against one another in the modern world have no basis in reality, but are an attempt to justify an otherwise arbitrary tariff or import restriction that is being placed on the goods of the complained about country.

The current complaints about Japan fall into this category - the countries complaining about Japan are using those complaints as a justification to ban Japanese fish - not fish from ""contaminated"" waters, but all fish that originate from Japanese owned fishing vessels, or which were processed in a Japanese owned plant.  

Japan is a major exporter of fish to other East Asian countries, and the purpose of these complaints is to benefit the fishing industries in the countries imposing the bans at the expense of the Japanese fishing industry."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 - How could a Canadian P3 aircraft, while flying over the Atlantic Ocean, possibly detect ‘banging noise’ attributed to a small submersible vessel potentially thousands of feet below the surface?","The Lockheed P-3 is an aircraft designed to find and sink submarines. The way they typically operate is that they drop sonar buoys into the ocean over a target area. These buoys record the audio from the ocean while they float on the surface or while sinking to the bottom. These sound recordings are then transmitted back to the P-3 and analyzed. They are able to analyze these data to find any abnormal sounds that is typically not found naturally in the ocean. If these are picked up on multiple buoys they can triangulate the source of this sound.

It is not quite clear what they have been hearing in this case. There are a lot of sounds in the ocean and even the best sonar operators are not able to fully identify a lot of these sounds. Especially when there are lots of search and rescue ships around it becomes a very difficult environment to identify sounds in. It is possible that these banging noises are related to the missing submarine but it might also be from some other source."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is 2160p video called 4K?,"Marketing. Resolutions are typically named after the vertical pixel count, which is the lower number. The jump from 480p (SD) to 720p (HD) was HUGE visually, so huge that small screens like phones and mobile game consoles are still made with 720p screens. AND the numbers of the terminology did look roughly double. However, that's not quite how it works. You have to multiply the horizontal and vertical pixels. 480p (in 16:9 ratio which wasn't common at the time) is 848 x 480, or 407,040 pixels. 720 is 1280 x 720 in a standard 16:9 widescreen, or 921,600 pixels. 

The jump from 720p to 1080p (FHD) came pretty quickly, and while it wasn't as big visually, it was still definitely noticeable. It was also still over double the number of pixels.  1080p is 1920 x 1080 in 16:9, or 2,073,600 pixels. The numbers only looked about 400 more again in name, but importantly, it was the baseline for a long time. 

Blu-ray in around 2006 allowed for full HD images. Video games struggled to hit 1080p often for that era (PS3/XB360) but PCs could do it, work monitors and TVs often had 1080p panels and are still popular, and it was standard in games by PS4/XBONE in 2013. The PS4 Pro and Xbox One X pushed 4k gaming a bit in 2016, but those were half-gen upgrades, the PS4 Pro didn't fully render it natively, and that's still at least a DECADE of 1080p being standard without even having access to anything new. DVDs in 480p were only king in the early 00s, for reference. 720p didn't have physical media pushing it that took off like DVDs or Blu-ray. 

1440p (QHD) started to be a thing for monitors as it typically does first, but wasn't catching on for TVs. Like at all. 720p had streaming to help it sell budget TVs, 1440p, not so much. It's STILL not available on most streaming services, and 1080p actually looks worse on a 1440p screen due to video scaling. And like 720p, it had no physical video media or console video games to boost it. 

1440p is 2560 x 1440 in 16:9, or 3,686,400 pixels. This is 1.77 times the pixels of 1080p, not ~2.25 times like the previous upgrades. But more importantly, it didn't SOUND much bigger either from the terminology. The consumer sees it and thinks ""what, only 400 more pixels again?""

Visually, I think going from 1080p to 1440p takes you about as far as going from 1080p to 4k, unless the screen is very big of course. Particularly on a computer monitor, you'll likely not notice the difference between 1440p and 4k even in video games. The only thing you'd see is more aliasing maybe. But it wasn't really enough for video consumers, or non-PC gamers. Even then, video cards were starting to plateau a bit, until recently it's been hard to get a PC to run anything new at 1440p with a decent frame rate. 

Anyway, 4k (UHD) is 3840 x 2160 in 16:9, or a whopping 8,294,40 pixels. 4x 1080p, and 2.25x 1440p. Normally it would be called 2160p, the vertical pixel count. But for marketing purposes, they decided 3840 (the horizontal pixel count) was close enough to 4000, and 4000 is ~4x 1080p, so they changed it to sound more accurate to what it actually is. Which is even more important, because #1 it sounds like a new technology. To most consumers they know standard definition, HD, and now 4k. And #2 because visually (for the average person and screen size) it's not all that different than 1080p, and even less different than 1440p, so they needed it to sound more impressive. That, combined with UHD Blu-ray, PS5/XBSeries, and lowering costs of TVs have made 4k a smashing success. 

Retroactively, 1440p is sometimes called ""2k"" now, even though 2560 is further from 2k than 3840 is from 4k. But it is more accurate on the sense that it's around double 1080p and half of 4k."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are combat boots better than hiking or running shoes in a warfare?,"A couple of reasons.

Combat boots are better at keeping your ankle from twisting.  Sneakers are great on a flat road, but not when you're running through uneven terrain.

Combat boots are much better at keeping water, rain, snow, etc., out.  Sometimes, a soldier has to keep his shoes on for days at a time, and trench foot is really nasty and can permanently cripple a soldier.

A sharp piece of metal (common in battlefield conditions) can pierce the bottom of a running show or slice through an unprotected ankle, so combat boots help protect from such hazards.

Boots also help against other hazards, such as snakebites, insect bites, walking through thorns or poison ivy, walking through disease-ridden swamps (or even pools of blood), etc."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 how Adderall works,"Doc here.

While we don't know the exact reason why stimulants help people with ADHD, it is believed that these people have abnormally low levels of dopamine in the parts of their brain responsible for attention and concentration. Dopamine is a feel-good hormone that is released with rewarding activities like eating and sex. It can also be released by certain stimulatory activities like fidgeting (or, in extreme cases, thrill activities like skydiving -- which is why some people literally get addicted to thrill sports). Since people with ADHD can't eat and have sex all the time, they respond to their lower dopamine levels by engaging in rewarding and impulsive behaviors, which usually come off looking like hyperactivity.

Drugs like Adderall increase the dopamine supply that's available to the brain. In people with ADHD, it *corrects* the level of dopamine to normal levels. Thus, it improves attention span and, in people with ADHD, reduces the need for self-stimulatory behavior. Too much Adderall, or any Adderall in normal people, will cause hyperactivity due to its effects on the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight). But in people with ADHD, the proper dosage will, for reasons mentioned, fix the hyperactivity. You reach the happy medium.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the awards! There are a lot of questions on here and I can't get to all of them. But if you feel you have ADHD and could benefit from medical therapy, definitely talk to your doctor!"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why was bloodletting considered an acceptable treatment for thousands of years?,"Bloodletting was popular because of the theory of medicine that was held at the time. Before germ theory, people believed in Humorism or the four humors. They were yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm. The body was made of these four liquids and to keep in good health they had to be balanced. Having too much or too little of one humor caused illness. Draining blood was believed to balance out the humors and remove excess. They also may have prescribed vomiting or given a diuretic to induce urination to balance them if a different humor was deemed the culprit.

To anyone who finds this interesting: there’s a cool theory that the idea of the humors came from people observing blood clotting in jars or vessels. When it separates, you see the dark clots at the bottom (black bile), the red blood cells above that (regular blood), the white layer of white blood cells (phlegm) and the yellowing serum on top (yellow bile). 

Edit: it was also used as a kind of personality test, depending on which humor was naturally more dominant in your body!

Phlegm: Low spirited, forgetful, reserved, calm, quiet. 

Black bile: Lazy, fearful, sickly, depressed, sensitive, moody. 

Yellow bile: Short tempered, daring, ambitious, aggressive.

Blood: Friendly, like to joke. Spirited, social and active."

It also generally gets them some leeway, as well as additional help at school, such as a dedicated ea (educational assistant - basically someone to be with them to help them navigate day to day stuff, and help them understand),.

Wet barrel hydrants have water valves connected to the supply pipe above the ground line in warm climates like Miami and San Diego. If you run them over with a car you get the classic movie geyser. Dry barrel hydrants have the valve connections buried underground.  The vertical pipe to the hydrant is empty until you open it. The supply line is insulated and water is already in motion by the pumping system. Water in motion does not freeze (energy/heat) and water in a 5” line takes a lot longer to freeze than you would think. Once you open a dry hydrant, you have to keep the water moving (fighting a fire, etc). Shutting down the hydrant connection is best done quickly. We used air to force the remaining water out of the barrel before it freezes. Propylene glycol would be added to prevent freezing at the valve junction. I’ve fought fire at < -40° C/F. If you moved too slowly breaking down hose lines and hydrants you would get frozen hoses. Not solid cores of ice but covered with ice and unable to roll the hose up. You threw them in a pickup bed and thawed them out at the fire station.

*Edit* ""Water in motion does not freeze (energy/heat)"" Take this as a fireground rule, not an absolute rule. This refers to circulating water in a closed loop. The pump is adding energy to the system and heats up the water. This prevents water from freezing the pump and lessens the chance of frozen connections at the pump panel."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 — in electrical work NEUTRAL and GROUND both seem like the same concept to me. what is the difference???,"This may not be 100% technically accurate, but I think it's ELI5 enough to answer the question in an understandable manner.

Think of a bathtub.

The live wire is the tap, it always has water in it. 

The bathtub is the circuit, it's where the water is used.

The neutral wire is the drain. It's where the water is supposed to go after it's done in the tub.

The ground is the overflow hole in the side of the tub. If the drain is broken, or if someone dumps way too much water into the tub, water can still go out the hole, instead of ruining the carpet.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why did the shirt, jacket and tie become the international standard dress code for business and governments?","Well my friend, the answer is distinction and intimidation.

A jacket flatters your profile, it widens your shoulders , flattens your chest, and gives you a bigger stature that says ""Me Big Boss""

Ties originated from Croatian mercenaries in the 30 years war, it held their jackets shut without requiring a stiff collar, and kings and nobility thought, wow that looks cool. Originally they used complex lace arrangements but they it expanded to other fabric types. Eventually English gentleman brought the style over from Europe, and cravat became a sign if wealth and class. You see, wealth could be denoted by the fabric, and the complexity of the knots required a certain level of skill and time, a commoner wouldn't be able to learn the etiquette to the level of an aristocrat. As industrialization spread, people wanted simple and straightforward accessories, this is where a necktie with its simpler knot and one that could be smaller or more compact, like a bow tie being a simpler wear than a cravat.

Shirts became a staple due to militarism function leading to fashion. For example a collar ensured a soldierly bearing with the head held upright, it also meant you didn't need mobility like some common labourer. They served to protect your quality outerwear from the indignities of your body, like perspiration. Since they were usually rather expensive, they could denote class. A gentleman in white could keep his shirt clean because hw wasn't sweating from toil, and he could afford multiple shirts, where as a labourer may wear the same shirt multiple days. This is why white dress shirts are formal."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - how can a place be constantly extremely rainy? Eg Maui is said to be one of the wettest places on earth where it rains constantly. What is the explanation behind this? Why would one place be constantly rainy as opposed to another place?,"Rain forms when moist air rises and condenses. I grew up in Norway, where the city of Bergen is notoriously rainy. The wind from the North Sea carries tons of moisture, and the city lies at the foot of tall coastal mountains, which force the air upwards, forming rain clouds. So look for tall mountains and moist air, and you'll find where it rains.

Fun fact: some of the world's driest places lie inland from such mountain ranges. They squeeze the moisture from the air like a sponge, so there's none to go around farther inland."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why are rabies incurable,"Rabies is caused by a virus. And viruses are treated by helping out the body's natural virus killing immune system. So without the immune system we can not fight the virus. Rabies attacks the nervous system, the brain. And due to the brain-blood barrier and a number of other things the immune system is not able to fight virus infections in the brain. So we can not really help it much at all. The best we can do is to vaccinate against rabies which helps the immune system fight the infection before it spreads to the brain. Even a vaccine given after someone is already infected will be fully effective at preventing the infection to spread to the brain."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why do our eyes feel like they have sand or grit in them when we’re very tired ?,"There's the obvious which is that tear production tends to slow the longer we're awake, but there's another factor that was indicated in a pretty [interesting study out of Columbia University:](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/new-research-suggests-rem-about-eyes-not-dreams)

There's also another function of REM, which is to allow the removal of dead cells and debris on the eyeballs in a gently and controlled manner. If you ever wondered what ""morning eye gunk"" was, in part it's that.

This leads to a way to help reduce this feeling, at least for short bursts. You close your eyes and have your eyeballs do figure-8's for a couple of minutes. It's very refreshing, gives your vision a break, helps to boost circulation and remove some debris, while giving your tears time to build up."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How are there so many videos, etc. of people interacting with bears peacefully even though they aren't domesticated?","Most animals aren't interested in mauling you. Imagine you're walking to Starbucks to get a coffee, minding your business, and then some literal alien starts harassing you. You have no idea why it's making weird beep-boop noises, you have no idea what that flashing light is. Your first instinct is probably to get the fuck away from this thing, especially if you've never seen one before. That's how most wild animals feel about humans.

Now, imagine it's a year later. The aliens just kinda show up at times and you don't really know why or how. Sometimes they give you money? Other times they try to get really, uncomfortably close to you - or even touch you. Maybe on a good day you just tolerate it, maybe on a bad day you don't and you yell at one of them. Maybe one of them does something scary or rude, and you punch them in self-defense. Maybe one of them tries to stop you from entering Starbucks, and you *really* want your morning Frappuccino, and you punch them. Now you know how animals who live near humans feel.

Imagine you grew up with these aliens. You might tolerate them *better*, you might even love them in your own way, but you might also think ""fuck these guys, I'm eating crackers in bed."" And then you punch them when they come in for the hundredth time and take away your crackers, or maybe when they poke you in the belly and that pisses you off, or maybe when someone's eating steak and not sharing. Now you know how a tamed wild animal feels.

Or, maybe you're just a super chill dude and you love your alien buddies! You're willing to give them all the understanding and love in the world, they're family to you. They give you food and massages. That doesn't mean you can't be in a scared or hurt or angry frame of mine and still punch someone, though. That's what a domesticated animal feels.

And that's why there's a lot of videos, pics, etc of people interacting with non-domesticated animals peacefully, and why you should still leave the wild animals the fuck alone + be mindful of domesticated animals."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 How can scientists accurately know the global temperature 120,000 years ago?","There’s a lot of good comments here about different paleoclimate proxies. A lot of them mention “oxygen isotopes”. But what does that mean? I’ll explain a little more how that works to help us understand how temperatures fluctuated in the ancient past. 

Water molecules can come in a couple different varieties depending on which isotope of oxygen happens to be attached to the hydrogen. In simple terms, there’s a heavy isotope of oxygen called O-18 and there’s a lighter one called O-16. So some molecules of water are ever so slightly heavier than others depending on which variety of oxygen they have as the O in H2O. 

Now imagine you have a box filled with ping pong balls and golf balls. The golf balls are a little heavier than the ping pong balls but otherwise they’re pretty much the same. Suppose you start gently shaking the box up and down. The ping pong balls are going to be jostled more, and more of them will fall out of the box than the golf balls. Now pretend you start shaking the box much harder. Lots of ping pong balls will still fly out, but now lots of the golf balls will fly out too. 

When the earth’s temperature is cool, it’s like when you’re shaking the box only gently; mostly it’s just the lighter molecules of ocean water that get evaporated while the heavier molecules stay behind. When the temperature rises the water molecules are being jostled harder so relatively more of those heavier molecules are evaporated into the atmosphere. Eventually that water vapor forms clouds, and some of those clouds eventually fall as snow into glaciers. When global temperatures are warm, that snow has relatively more of the heavier molecules compared to snow that falls in colder climate conditions. In reality there’s a lot of complicated factors that have to be considered when studying this stuff but that’s the basic idea. 

When scientists study ice cores, they’re analyzing how the proportions of the heavy vs light isotopes of oxygen changed in the layers of snow that fell thousands of years ago, and with that they can work out a very precise picture of how global temperatures have changed over time."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: What exactly is a ""racist dogwhistle""?","In addition to what other people have said, it's called a ""dog whistle"" because dogs can hear higher pitched sound than most humans, so a dog whistle, a whistle whose purpose it is to command a dog, is largely inaudible to humans while still able to be heard by dogs.

So it's a ""racist dog whistle"" because it's inaudible to most people while still being heard loud and clear by racists.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How exactly does food poisoning work? How does the body know that the food is contaminated and which way to expel it out? How does it know when things are safe again?,"The food gets digested and nutrients get taken in by the body. If it's contaminated, let's say by salmonella, the bacteria also makes it into your body.

Your immune system will quickly find the bacteria, and try to kill it. Part of that means purging the digestive tract (diarrhea and vomit) to get rid of the source. Fever is added to kill off the bacteria that already made it past your digestive system. 

It knows it's save when there are no longer any offending bacteria in your body. 

Of course it's more complicated than this, but hopefully you understand the basics now.

There are other methods as well, especially for dealing with inclines and declines but that is getting deep into the process."

Sometimes, your body might also send some special cells to help. These cells are like superhero cleaners. They can surround the bug, break it down, and carry the parts away. So, even if you're not coughing, your body has ways to get rid of the bug and keep your lungs clean and healthy.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why did the U.S. Marines (an amphibious force) fight in Afghanistan (a landlocked country)?,"So generally the US marines are more like an Expeditionary force or a rapid deployment force more than just amphibious fighting force. So before modern standing armies were a thing, historically you needed an experienced field army to perform smaller military operations and to be the first fighting force for a larger conflict. They do the fighting while the rest of the military drafts forces and scales up. Similar principle applies. 

I'm not too familiar with Marine policies specifically in the 90s,2000s, and 10s, but more or less they do operate as a smaller but self contained full military. They had jets (typically air force or navy), ships (typically navy), infantry and attack choppers and tanks (typically army) and can work in a more uniform command structure with supply and transport from the Navy. They only really lacked submarines and dedicated satellites. 

Now the modern marines are reforming to be a more lighter and faster assault force. As a result, they disbanded their armored units and got rid of their Abrams due to logistics difficulties of moving such a heavy piece of hardware. The military in general is in the midst of a massive overhaul with new guns, new planes, new tactics, new everything. This is especially true for the the Army, while the Marines have to get things approved out of the Navy budget, more or less."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Fission and fusion can convert mass to energy, what is the mechanism for converting energy to mass?","Both fission and fusion can convert energy into mass. It just depends on the elements. For example if you fuse iron atoms with deuterium atoms you get cobalt which have higher mass then iron and deuterium combined. This fusion does require energy input.

Most of these events happens in supernovaes. So we have not directly observed any of it. But we can see the effects of this and compare the composition of older and newer stardust to see exactly how this happens. But we can also create matter using energy in our labs. This is the primary purpose of particle accelerators. They are basically machines bulit to focus a lot of energy into a tiny area and observe what strange particles gets created. These particles have mass which far excedes the mass of the input particles."
explainlikeimfive,eli5 : how big ship anchors don't get stuck in the sea bed rocks ?,"Anchors resist a sideways pull. When anchored you have enough anchor rode (rope and/or chain) for at least double the depth of water. The weight of the rode makes it form a curve called a catenary which means that at the anchor the pull is almost completely horizontal.

Then when you want to raise the anchor you pull in the rode until it is straight up and down. This rotates the anchor and breaks it out of the seabed without much resistance.

As for avoiding getting the anchor stuck in rocks, the trick is not to anchor in places with rocks. A lot of seabed is mud, sand, shingle etc."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How can you place calls to emergency numbers on phones without SIM cards?,"The SIM card isn't necessary for your phone to send radio signals to cell phone towers. All the technology is already there in your phone. It's just that cell towers are programmed not to accept any requests from phones who can't authorize themselves. Basically, your phone goes ""hey tower, I'd like to place a call please"", and the tower goes ""okay, what's the password?"". And if your phone can't give the password, then the call doesn't get placed. The job of the SIM card is to provide the password. (It's not literally a password, but you can think of it that way.)

The only exception is an emergency call. Cell towers are programmed with a list of numbers that any phone can place calls to, password or no. So no, there is no hack or workaround. You end up going ""hey can I place a call to 911?"", and the tower goes ""yeah okay, no password necessary for that"". And then you go ""oh no actually call my mom"". And then the tower says ""okay, password please?"". There's no getting around it - you can't both call an emergency number *and* your mom (unless your mom happens to be a 911 operator and you're willing to roll the dice)."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why are horses who break their legs so often euthanized?,"Horses are skittish, dumb, 1200 pound balls of anxiety supported by toothpick legs.

They do not handle anesthesia very well and tend to get very panicky when they wake up. This makes them very likely to re-break their leg, break a different leg, or otherwise hurt themselves.

Allowing a broken bone to heal takes a lot of time *not* using that leg. Taking the weight off of one leg puts more weight on the others, increasing the likelihood of another break or another injury. They aren't used to long periods of not standing, walking, and running, so trying to force bed rest leads to bedsores and a panicky horse that will, again, be more likely to hurt themselves.

Because they are so panicky, if the horse gets spooked its first instinct is going to be to try to run...which it can't do, because it still has a broken leg. Either it will try to put the full force of a galloping horse onto that leg and break it again, or get tripped up by some kind of cast, fall, and break something else.

And even if everything goes *perfectly*, once the leg has been broken it probably will never be able to support the same force that it did before. The horse is likely to break that leg again, leading to another round of pain and suffering.

From an economic standpoint, it is very rarely worth the hassle. People have tried to mend legs on super valuable race horses - not to get them to race again, but just to let them breed - and it never works out well. From the standpoint of the quality of life of the animal, it's more humane to euthanize them. It will be months of anxiety and trauma and pain trying to mend the leg with a very high chance of getting injured again, leading to even more trauma and pain and a longer recovery with more chances to get injured *again*, for a slim chance at successful recovery that still won't give the horse a good quality of life and a high chance of getting hurt again."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is it necessary to rinse eyes for 15 minutes after getting a chemical in? Wouldn't 1 minute be enough?,"I got my Ph. D. in chemistry and took lab safety classes during grad school and for work later. I remember this particular part of safety training. 

Your eye is relatively spongy. When chemicals get into your eye, they can soak in quickly. Then when you’re rinsing your eyes, you’re fighting equilibrium of the chemical being in your eye tissue vs going into the water. The constant flushing pulls the chemical away dissolved in water, but it takes a long time for all the chemical to fully leech out of your eye into the water. 

As others have said, some chemicals absorb more slowly into the eye and stay on the surface more, making it easier for the water to wash it away faster, so those chemicals could be washed away in much less time. 

But which chemicals absorb less well like this? We don’t know. So it’s best to play it safe and assume 15 minutes is required. And some chemical manufacturers may have done some sort of testing that indicate that the 15 minutes really are necessary to fully remove the chemical from your eye."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - why do data breaches cost millions of dollars?,"There are a combination of reasons that combine to result in those numbers.

Depending on what nation the company is in, there are regulatory penalties that can be applied if its shown the company didn't take required precautions to protect the information.

There are potential civil law suits from the people affected by the breach.

There is a loss of business after a breach too. Customers are less likely to do business if they are worried their information is at risk. Other companies become more reluctant becuase they don't want the association.

All of these factors can result in significant financial loss to companies that experience data breaches."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why does your body get achy when you are sick?,"None of the top comments (at the moment of posting this) are correct.

The achy feeling is caused three things:

- General inflammation.  The immune system uses inflammation basically as a way of communicating to itself and other body systems ""Send resources here to help me fight the infection"".  This inflammation itself causes pain, and sometimes it can spill over into areas of the body that aren't in need of special attention.  There's a theory that this muscle and joint 'spill-over' inflammation pain is 'intentional' by evolution, because it causes us to be less active, which helps with recovery (rest), but this hasn't been proven.

- Toxic activities by the immune system.  In some places, the immune system (white blood cells) are actually killing other cells that have become infected.  The chemicals used to send these ""kill"" messages can also have a 'spill-over' into other areas of the body, causing pain.  This is not a major part of sickness aches, though.

- Swollen lymph nodes.  Your body is covered in hundreds of lymph nodes connected by a separate circulation network.  When you are fighting an infection, one part of your immune system is trying to basically catch (eat) infected cells and pathogens and then bring them to lymph nodes where that can be broken down and/or shuttled away as waste.  During this time, your lymph nodes swell with fluide and also experience some inflammation which helps get resources to them so they can work more effectively.

Hope that helps."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 what happens if a cemetery runs out of space to bury bodies?,"Well, in the tiny but very densely populated country that I happen to live in that's called The Netherlands, it works like this:

A grave usually isn't really bought but rather leased for a period of at least 10 years. After the 10 years are up the lease can be extended for a period of 5-20 years.

Up to three people can be buried in a single grave, stacked on top of each other, with some ground in between. (These people can be total strangers in case it's a common grave instead of a private one)

Now, to answer your question, to make room for more people they can ""shake"" the grave. This means they dig up the remains still present and rebury all of them about 50cm below the lowest level. Sometimes they put the remains directly into the ground, sometimes they use a tiny box or bag. The grave now has room for the original amount of people again. It's important to know that this can only be done after the topmost person has been buried for at least 10 years.

Another option is to simply clear the grave. In that case all the remains are either transferred to a common grave or cremated."
explainlikeimfive,eli5:why is Africa generally poor compared to the rest of the world.,"The short answer: geography.

The longer answer: Africa is one of world’s largest landmasses that lacks navigable waterways, with a few key exceptions. It’s not a coincidence that Egypt is one of the few places in Africa where advanced civilization developed- the Egyptians had the Nile, and they had access to the Mediterranean. Of the remaining African rivers that do exist, they are often not easily navigable or they lack year round access. For example, the Congo has several waterfalls and it floods every year to such a point that it creates temporary lakes that are miles in diameter. 

If you cannot transport goods by water, you are limited to the far more expensive method of land transport. Land transportation is only suitable for high value goods, such as gold and slaves- which were a major commodity in the trade of various West African kingdoms. 

If you have year round water transportation, you can trade your excess crops in a timely manner (before they go bad), you can import goods that you don’t produce yourself (such as steel or spices), and you can build sophisticated trade networks. 

Africa is also lacking in valleys, mountain ranges, and other geographic features that are beneficial for development. When clouds carry rain encounter a mountain range, wind currents will usually cause them to be compressed to a point a where they will turn into rain - and a much less dense form of cloud will ascend to a new altitude above the mountains while the mountain range experiences rain. 

Mountains also act as a storage by retaining rain water as ice and snow, and the melting of the ice and snow during the summer months is what helps to avoid droughts and keep a river navigable during the hot parts of the year. 

When rivers pass through a valley, that valley acts as a natural barrier against flooding and keeps the flow of the river predictable over time. A river that is going over flat land can alter course over time, which is especially disruptive for any sort of trade network or agrarian economy. 

Mountains and rivers are also natural defensive lines, allowing a civilization to protect itself from invaders. 

The closest geographical analog to Africa is the Asiatic part of Russia."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: NY Stock exchange back in the 80s, with a bunch of people screaming and throwing paper. How did the trades get carried out? It seemed like absolute chaos.","Overly simplified of course, but the gist is that customer calls a broker to initiate a certain trade (buy 500 shares of X, at price Y).  Broker calls down to the ""pit"" (where trades take place on the exchange floor), lets the floor man know what trade(s) to make.  Floor man goes over to the pit, initiates hand signals to identify to the pit that he wants to buy, looks for the accompanying hand signals for people looking to sell.  Eye contact.  More hand signals exchanged, deal is agreed to.  Both buyer and seller write down their notes as to what the trade details were, then both go back to their phones, call their bosses and report the trade.  Reconcile at the end of the day and if everything matches, all good, move on to the next day."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: why is South Korea's birth rate falling harder than other developed countries?,"I used to live there.  Having kids in Korea is very expensive.  It's a hyper competitive society, families put huge emphasis on education and will spend large sums to get their kids in the best schools.  Add on to that that Korea is already an expensive, stressful place to live. It is normal there for people to work 10-12 hour days, then go out drinking with their coworkers afterwards until late into the night. If your boss invites you all out, which is common, it's not always easy to say no.  Hard to raise a family with that lifestyle.  Now add in to that that Korea is a very conservative country.  Single mothers there are heavily stigmatized, they could be fired from their jobs and ostracized from their families.  I had a white coworker who got pregnant and she lied to her boss that she was getting married so she wouldn't lose her job.  Most women who get pregnant out of wedlock will get an abortion.  If they have a baby it will very often be sent to an orphanage, however Koreans have no culture of adoption, they place a great deal of importance on bloodline, blood relatives. An adopted child wouldn't really be considered ""family"", as such many of them end up sent overseas to places like america.  While Korea is a wealthy, developed country, it is also very unequal.  It is hard for average Koreans to get a good job, even with a college degree.  There are other reasons but those are some of the big ones."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why do horses need shoes? Is this a consequence of domestication? What about wild horses?,"It's important for the comfort of the horse that their hooves wear down properly. In the wild, their hooves experience wear from stoney and sandy surfaces. 

Domesticated horses can suffer from two very different scenarios. They might not be exposed to any surfaces that can adequately wear down their hooves. In that case, their hooves can grow out of control, and, without correction, can cause permanent damage to some of their foot bones. The hooves can curl, and walking on them can be quite painful. 

On the other hand, working horses can be exposed to hard surfaces like concrete while either pulling or carrying a load. This can cause excessive wear to the hooves. 

Either way, regular visits from a farrier to shape and shoe the hoof keeps the horse healthy and pain-free.

Cows and Oxen are occasionally shod, as well. Sometimes sled dogs wear booties to protect their foot pads, as well."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: What's it called if I buy something like a sandwich, then consume it, and the net worth of society has now shrunk by 1 sandwich? Versus buying something that keeps its value.","From an economics standpoint, eating the sandwich is consumption. Purchasing a plot of land is investment in an asset. Neither one is good or bad, they just do different things.

Some purchases seem to blur the lines. If you buy a house to live in, it's both an asset and something that gets used. That gets accounted for by counting the house itself as an asset, and living in the house as consumption, since you could otherwise rent it out. (Passing up on this is called the opportunity cost.)

In practice, even though you could try to hold onto a sandwich and resell it, it's treated as immediate consumption with an asset value of zero. Which I would endorse if you ever try to sell me a second-hand sandwich.

As far as ""the net worth of society"", remember that the sandwich was only made to be eaten, because it was expected to be eaten. All the stuff and effort that went into making it won't ever be used if people stop eating sandwiches. The ""worth of society"" won't need to change. People will just start producing the stuff that replaced sandwiches."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How Does a Tug-of-War Accident Sever Somebody's Arms?,"When you have a lot of people pulling on a rope there is a lot of energy stored in there.

Several fatal tug of war accidents are on record, with most being the result of using the wrong type of rope (nylon) ~~instead of a rope that has a degree of elasticity and involving large teams of pullers.~~

*EDIT: Nylon ropes are bad for for Tug-of-War both due to* **too much** *elasticity meaning that it can store far more energy than a fiber or cotton rope, and because it is far more likely to burn skin due to sliding and pulling. Twisted Cotton ropes are recommended for the sport because they are less likely to cause injury to the hands. If you haven't figured out yet based on this post you should also avoid doing tug of war with more than a dozen or so people.*

If the rope snaps while it's under tension it has enough energy to snap back and seriously hurt someone. The resulting impact can sever fingers, or depending on where it hits can potentially be fatal.

From an article:

""On June 13, 1978 in a Pennsylvania suburb, the entirety of Harrisburg middle school — some 2,300 students — lined up in a schoolyard and attempted to set a Guinness World Record for the largest tug of war game ever played. Instead, disaster ensued.

Twelve minutes into the match, the 2,000-foot-long braided nylon rope snapped, recoiling several thousand pounds of stored energy. “It sounded like someone pulled the string on a party cracker,” recalled 14-year-old participant Shannon Meloy. “I smelled something burning and I thought it was the rope…but it was hands. I looked down and saw…blood.” In the ensuing chaos, nearly 200 students lay wounded — five with severed fingertips, and one missing a thumb. Hundreds more faced second-degree burns. “It was just a game,” another student told the Gadsden Times a day later. “We just wanted to see how many could do it.”

The rope, provided by Pennsylvania Power and Light Co., had been intended for use in heavy construction, and was rated to withstand 13,000 pounds of stress."""

Inorganic compounds like iron, calcium, etc. as well as macronutrients (proteins, carbs, fats, etc) are excluded.

The vitamins were classified by letter during the early 1900s, before we knew what the chemicals physically looked like. At first, we mainly figured them out by looking at the different diseases caused by deficiency (for example, scurvy is caused by lack of Vitamin C).

Over time, we discovered that some vitamins were actually multiple very different compounds, so we started creating sub-assignments under the letter. That's how we got some of the B's.

There were also some vitamins that we later discovered weren't actual vitamins, or were so similar to other vitamins that they didn't really deserve their own letter. Vitamin H was renamed to B7. Vitamin F ended up being a type of fat. That's why there are so many weird holes in the vitamin naming system nowadays."

As a side note your mouth also scars, but the tissue generates WAY faster than your skin so it isn't as noticeable -- something like 1/8th the amount of a skin scar.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do we feel cold when we have fever,"Your body has a kind of built-in thermostat that it can regulate. When you get a fever, the first thing that happens is that the thermostat gets cranked up a few notches when the body decides it needs to be hotter e.g. to kill off an infection more effectively. The body then suddenly finds itself at an actual core temperature lower than the “set” temperature of the thermostat. This produces the feeling of cold forcing you to get under a blanket, drink hot beverages etc. in order to raise your core temperature to the “set” temperature as fast as possible. So that feeling is the way your body communicates to you what it needs to be done right now. You also get involuntary shivers which are a way of raising core temperature as well (rapid muscle movement spends their stored energy and releases heat)."

So an open wound won’t suck in seawater.

However, the blood pressure away from major veins and arteries isn’t that high, so the blood isn’t spraying out (think about how slowly blood comes out of a paper cut). That means that contaminants in the water like parasites or bacteria can get into your body if the water mixes with your blood or if they can “swim” into your body faster than blood flows out."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: What is ""wet bulb temperature"" and why does it matter?","I'm going to start off with why it matters because the definition of what it is makes a little more sense with the background.

Like a car engine, our bodies can overheat and break. If it's hot outside, we need something to cool us off. Luckily for us, evolution gave us a solution: sweat. Sweat is mostly water and has a high thermal conductivity, which means that heat transfers to/from it faster than other materials. When we sweat, it absorbs some of our body heat then evaporates into the air, taking the heat with it.

Now, this isn't perfect. There are situations where sweat will do nothing. Air can only hold so much water. When you see humidity measurements, it's always in %. Well, that % is how much water is in the air compared to how much it can hold. At 100% humidity, the air is holding a much water as it can and water can no longer evaporate.

When this happens, sweat can no longer do anything to cool us off so we have to rely on the air temperature, which most of the time is also enough to prevent us from overheating.

However, in recent years, we've been having weather events where not only is it very humid but also very hot. It's humid enough where sweat can't cool us off and hot enough where the ambient temperature doesn't do it either, so we overheat. This is a ""Wet Bulb Event""

So then, what exactly is ""Wet Bulb Temperature""? What we do to get it is take a thermometer and wrap the bulb with a wet rag. The rag acts like sweat soaked skin, so it cools off the thermometer. It's effectively a measurement of how effective our natural cooling will work. To add to this, while our bodies operate at 98.6 °F, it actually needs to be cooler than that to prevent overheating. 94 °F is around the temperature we begin to overheat. If the Wet Bulb Temperature is 94°F or higher, being outside is incredibly dangerous as you WILL begin to overheat, and as such when the wet bulb temperature is 94 or greater, that's a wet bulb event."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - Why is it bad to use my water bottle for multiple days without washing it?,"I work for a water bottling company and we actually do lab tests for this sort of thing all the time. 

Now the theory is that an open and used bottle of water will be introduced to bacteria from the air and from your mouth. This bacteria in small amounts is obviously not harmful (and new bottled water has small amounts of bacteria anyway), but if left to multiply and grow can be a problem. Just like with any food. 

Does this really happen in reality? Mostly no. So mostly this process won’t be fast or severe enough to do any damage if you reuse your bottle for a few days or even weeks. However there is no guarantee. And depending on the environment and the water you use, the level of bacteria can become too high and make you sick. Say you replace bottled water with well water and leave it out in the sun in the summer, it won’t be safe to drink after a few days - it’ll probably turn Green."
explainlikeimfive,eli5 why the split between right and left handedness in the population 90/10 and not 50/50?,"No one knows, and while there are varying hypotheses as to why, none of them have been accepted or proven. I'd argue the most popular hypothesis proposes that it's a function of how our brains are split, and the roles each hemisphere of the brain typically takes. It's true that handedness is influenced by that, but in turn that just changes the question to why the distribution of hemisphere-dominance is 90/10! Another hypothesis is that the genes which code for this property are highly conserved, maybe they're very necessary for some other thing that has a strong selection bias. 

At the end of the day though, the only real answer is that nobody knows for sure."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do we calculate the length of a pregnancy from the first day of a women’s last period?,Every time you have your period it is your body getting ready for the next opportunity to get pregnant.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does it feel warmer to walk barefoot over wooden floors than to walk over ceramic tiles even if both are side-by-side in the same room?,"How warm or cold something feels depends on how fast the heat is being taken away from you.

Your body constantly produces heat, so it needs to constantly get rid of heat. If it doesn't get rid of enough heat, you'll feel warm. If a lot of heat gets ""sucked out"" of your body, you will feel cold.

Heat transfer between your feet and wood is slower than heat transfer between feet and ceramic tiles, hence wood feels warmer.

Different materials have different thermal properties, so heat transfer goes at different rates depending on the material.

Also, a fun fact related to this - if you put an ice cube on a ceramic floor, it will melt quicker than on wood despite the tiles feeling colder. The reason is the same - there's faster heat transfer going on between the ceramic tile and ice cube compared the wooden floor."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how does a VPN hide your traffic from your isp?,"A VPN has an encrypted connection between you and them.  Your ISP can see that you are connected to the VPN and can tell that you are downloading lots of data, but it cannot tell what that data is, or even what type of data it is.

In ELI5 terms, normal web traffic is like if you hand the your ISP a piece of paper that say ""Please give this to youtube: Please show me video dQw4w9WgXcQ"" and then youtube hands your ISP a piece of paper that says ""Please give this to StupidRobots: Here's the video.""

A VPN service gives you an envelope that you can put the piece of paper into, so you're handing the ISP an envelope with ""Please give this to my VPN"" and then your the VPN hands your ISP an envelope that says ""Please give this to stupidrobots.""

They can see *that* you are making a request and getting a response, but they can't see *what* the request or response is.  They can tell how big the response is, but they can't tell if it's a video, a videogame, or the Q3 TPS reports.

Somewhat related, there's also TOR (the onion router) which you might have heard about in conjuction with the ""deep web.""  It acts something like a VPN but instead of just one envelope there's dozens, maybe hundreds, all nested together.

So you hand the first one to your ISP and it says ""Please give this to TOR1"" and then TOR1 gets it and opens it and finds another envelope that says ""Please give this to TOR2"" and then TOR2 gets it and there's another envelope that says ""Please give this to TOR3.""  At this point TOR1 knows it came from you, TOR2 only knows that it came from TOR1 and that it's going to TOR3.  It has no idea where it came from or where it's ultimately going.  Eventually your request reaches the server you were trying to talk to in the first place and the whole process happens in reverse, with your data bouncing from router to router with most of them having absolutely no idea where the data came from or where it's actually going, or what it is."

explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why is water clear in small amount but blue in large amount like an ocean?,"I realize this isn't very satisfying, but water looks blue because it is very slightly blue. Water absorbs other colors, but allows blue light to pass through, meaning it is blue. In small amounts of water the blue isn't noticeable, but it becomes noticeable when there is more - that's why the deep end of a pool looks like a darker shade of blue than the shallow end. You see the same thing with sheets of clear glass - a very thin sheet of glass will not seem to have color, but a thicker sheet will.

There are also generally impurities in water that will affect the color. In most swimming pools you have chlorine, which affects thing."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why can’t we just remove greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere,"The thing that all the comments thus far are missing is that there really isn't that much CO2 in the air.  Not denying climate science, it's just a fact.  CO2 makes up about 0.04% of the atmosphere.  

Technologies exist to scrub CO2 from air.  They aren't perfect, but let's assume for a second that they are.  To remove 1 tonne of CO2 from the air we'd need to process about 2500 tonnes of air.  Air is famously not very heavy.  2500 tonnes of air about 2 billion litres of air.  That's about twice the amount of space the empire state building takes up.

That's to remove only 1 tonne of CO2.  How much CO2 do we need to remove?  That's hard to pin down.  But A LOT.  One number I've found is 10 billion tonnes every year.  To remove that much CO2 we'd need to process 19 billion billion litres of air.  That's all the air in the entire USA from the ground up 1.2 miles (almost 2 km)

Moving air (with fans and compressors) is surprisingly energy intensive.  Moving that much air would use a lot of energy and therefore cost a lot of money.

A really rough calculation of fan power (I'm not a fan guy, so this might be way off) indicates that it would take about 800 gigawatts of power continuously to move that much air in a year (plus extra power to process the air).  That's somewhere between 130 and 270 million households worth of power.  If you build this hypothetical facility today in the USA it would generate about 2 billion additional tonnes of CO2.  That much electricity would cost more than 1 trillion dollars and that would only pay to move the air around.

Compressing or storing the CO2 uses even more energy

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: What is modernism and post-modernism?,"Shortest possible version:

Coming out of the Reformation, a bunch of guys got together in a philosophical and political movement called ""The Enlightenment."" They looked at what Newton and Descartes had done in science and wanted to do the same in law and ethics. They said, ""Just as we can drive universal mathematical truths and arrive at scientific laws, we can find universal moral truths to derive political laws!""

In response a bunch of artists, philosophers, and theologians collectively called ""Romantics"" said, ""Hold on. This is great and all,  but there are all kinds of things beyond your ability to just study in book. You can't reduce the human experience to a set of equations!""

To which the Modernists replied, ""Fuck you, watch us."" They came up with a whole bunch of ideas, not just in the hard sciences but in politics and social sciences, that were all based around ""objectivity"" and the idea that they were perfect, rational observers. 

Eventually the Post-modernists show up. They look at the core of all Modernist thought and say that objectivity was always a comforting lie. ""All these 'laws' of yours are just stories you tell to explain the world to yourself. They might be useful, but stories change depending on the person telling them and the audience."" They got very interested in the idea that *ideas* can tell you about the people who hold them."

After her passing, the Russia government began to roll back many of the benefits/privileges that Catherine had provided them, so they looked to leave Russia. At the time, a lot of South American countries were trying to attract immigrants from Europe to boost their population and settle the land. Argentina and Brazil attracted a lot of these German emigrants, as they both had officially installed Roman Catholicism as their state religion (the Volga Germans were mainly Catholics).

So there was a large population of ethnic Germans in Argentina long before the world wars. This led to friendly relationships between Argentina and both Imperial Germany and Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, this made Argentina a prime destination for those who were associated with Nazi Germany and wanted to flee.

Typically ""you"" are experiencing the world around you through your own senses and making decisions based on your interactions with that world. Subject to limitations of perspective, the reality that you describe will be consistent with what others around you also describe.

Somebody dissociating may no longer feel like they are inhabiting their own body. There's somebody over there who you know is ""you"" but you are not controlling that person directly, or experiencing what they are experiencing, or feeling what they are feeling.

Another example is if you have created a false reality that ""you"" are sure is correct. You distinctly remember having a conversation with a friend about a certain topic, but that friend claims it never happened, and others support their claim.

In both cases, you are not experiencing reality in a functional way.

Why can this happen? Personally, I have narcolepsy, and like most people with the condition, my dreams are cinematic. It's like they are really happening. False memories are easy to generate if you dwell on those dreams. Combine that situation with the ""brain fog"" that comes from a lack of proper sleep that is also part of narcolepsy, and both forms of dissociation described above can occur all too easily. I constantly fight to stay centered in reality, refusing to dwell on my dreams, and continually reminding myself to stay in the moment during my waking hours."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: the strongest magnet in the world boasts 900 times the earths magnetism, so why wouldn’t a compass point towards those superior magnets?","Magnets ability to do, well, magnet stuff decreases rapidly over distance. Very rapidly.  That means to effect a long distance, magnets need to either be super big or bonkers, absolutely wildly powerful, or even both.

The earth's magnetic field is both powerful and super big.... so it does its thing, its really really big

I'm not sure exactly what magnet you're talking about, but im sure its fairly small in comparison. Even industrial facilities that do extreme magnetism, with powerful magnets, the magnetism doesn't stretch out very far, think like in terms of like several meters, with most of the power right up near the magnet as it drops off tremendously with distance.  The earth's magnetic field though is just insanely massive, so it still has some strength even at a great distance

So if you put a compass right up to a small powerful magnet, yeah it'll fuck up the compass, but even if its just a little bit away, the power of that small magnet won't be much, so it won't affect the compass, the earth will though"
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do animals not have Down syndrome, while humans do? Is there any reason for this?","A [case](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28220267/) of a syndrome similar to Down syndrome has been reported in chimpanzees. 

Down syndrome arises as a result of a *trisomy*, i.e. when someone has 3 copies of a certain chromosome instead of the usual 2. In the case of Down, it's the 21st chromosome that is affected. Most trisomies of other chromosomes in humans are fatal, meaning the pregnancy ends in a miscarriage or stillbirth, or the child dies at a young age. Trisomy 21 (resulting in Down syndrome) is an exception, along with a few others.

Humans have 46 chromosomes, organized in 23 pairs: 22 numbered autologous chromosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (X/Y). Other animals' genomes are organized differently, with different numbers of chromosomes. Besides which, of course, they have different genes. So, for these two reasons, there is no exact analog to Down syndrome among non-human animals, since no other animal has the same genes or even the same set of chromosomes as us. 

However, chimps being our closest relatives, they can get close. Their 22nd chromosome is very similar to our 21st, and in the case I linked to above, a chimp was born with 3 copies of this chromosome, and this resulted in symptoms that overlapped with those of Down syndrome as we see it in humans. 

Other trisomies (and more generally polysomies, meaning any number of copies above the normal 2) certainly occur in animals too. Some have been documented in dogs, for instance. But most we simply don't know about. As I said, most trisomies are fatal, so you won't find any animals with those. The remaining trisomies that occur in humans all lead to serious developmental disorders or birth defects, to an extent that would likely be fatal in the wild at a young age too. We simply can't document all the genetic defects that cause wild animals to perish - how would we even know where to look? Animals die all the time, after all, and young animals especially. So most of the ones we do know about happen in captive or domesticated animals, since those are the ones we actually see."

Your friend is walking across a field at night towards you.

You pickup your nerf ball gun and spray in a line across the field. When a ball, or a bunch of them, hit your friend they come back towards you. Congratulations, you found your friend.

Now your friend goes stealth. He carries a padded cardboard box, except he points a corner of it towards you, so any balls directed at him bounce off to the sides - or because of the padding just get absorbed.

Stealth planes either deflect or absorb radar ""bouncy balls"" so that they don't get sent back to the enemy. It comes down to the design of the plane as well as the materials used as, you can't have any signal going towards the enemy or they will see you."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 why do we produce a lot more saliva right before we vomit?,"Supposedly ""hypersalivation"" happens because the two parts that control vomiting and salivation in our brain are so close to each other that cascades(""waves"") of excitation regularly happen and spread to nearby ""circuits"", especially accompanying the signal cascade that forces your body into convulsion and vomiting.

Due to the high acidity of our stomach contents, this also serves to protect the mucous membranes so there might even have been evolutionary pressure selecting slightly for that kind of wiring."

Top level body builders, strongmen, Olympic athletes and what have you, people who are already packing a very large amount of dense muscle, may need up to 2g per ~~lb~~ kg in order to gain more (since it takes them so much to even maintain their mass), these types of athletes are probably engaging in at least two multiple hour workouts **per day.**

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How can Prince Rupert's Drop be so strong? Isn't it just ordinary glass?,"They are also incredibly fragile. A single chip from any direction that is not the 'head' of the drop will cause the entire thing to crack and often completely shatter.

The way the drops are formed involves the outer layer solidifying quickly and the interior slowly cooling. This causes the molecules of the glass to contract enough that basically every molecule of the drops' head is constantly pulling on all the other molecules, and this force needs to be over come before any part of the drop will break away from the rest. So instead of needing a small amount of force to crack or chip the glass, it basically takes as much force to disintegrate the entire thing at once in order to break it even a little.

And all that force is already in the drop, holding it in place. So when the tail is broken, and those pieces that were being pulled on by the head of the drop are shifted, the same force that was holding everything in place 'slips' and now has a direction to pull. This is what causes the entire thing to break if the tail is broken."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: why is drunk sleep not the same as sober sleep?,"Alcohol interferes with REM sleep and doesn't allow your body to do the crucial things it does during those cycles. So drunk sleep doesn't fully rejuvenate you or bolster learning and memory the way sober sleep does.

In fact, if you drink every night for a while, and then stop, your brain will try to catch up on REM, and you will probably have really vivid dreams.

Taken to the extreme, severe alcoholics will have suppressed REM so much that if they start to sober up a little, their brain will start to have REM even while they are awake, causing wild hallucinations. ~~This is called Delirium Tremens.~~ This is a major symptom of an alcohol withdrawal disorder called Delirium Tremens.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How can a college athlete in the United States have seven years in a collegiate sport?,Everyone starts with 4 years of eligibility. Add 1 year for normal redshirt. Everyone who was in college in 2020 got 1 extra year of eligibility so that's 2. Now we're at 6. A 2nd redshirt year can be granted for medical reasons but it has to be approved by the NCAA I believe. So that's 7 years. It's definitely unusual but possible for some players.
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does the human body jerk/shock itself awake sometimes while trying to sleep?,"It's a funny thing actually. So, you are starting to fall asleep; your brain starts sending signals throught your body to prepare you to sleep.

Sometimes, the same brain that sent signals to make these asjustments thinks ""OH SHIT WE'RE DYING"" and so sends a jolt of signals to wake you up."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 - Why are we finding entire homes and streets in archaeological digs? doesn't anyone notice a street or building starting to get covered in dirt and dust? at some point someone must notice the old plato theatre is knee high into the earth?,"Whole structures do get abandoned sometimes.

Pompeii was famously buried in a single day from a volcanic eruption and perfectly preserved.

Settlements along the Nile were routinely abandoned when the river changed course.

Floods, wars, major earthquakes.  The collapse of the government and associated trade.  Mines ran empty.  Wells ran dry.  Sea route replaced the old overland route.

House burned down.

The planet is littered with settlements that didn’t work out for some reason or another.  Sometimes people come back eventually and build over the top, sometimes they never return.

There’s also a significant survival bias for buried ruins - structures that didn’t get buried for some reason were eventually torn down or weathered away."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - where does skin in your body stop being skin? Is the roof of the mouth skin? The back of the throat? How does skin attach and transition to non-skin flesh?,"You essentially have two types of „skin“.

TLDR: in short you inner skin (mucosa) and outer skin (dermis) are fundamentally the same. Both have a connective tissue that holds it together and a layer above that protects it. Skin hardens and has nerve endings, whereas mucosa secretes slime and often doesnt have nerve endings. The transitions are in lips, eyelids, genitals, anus. 

One is what we would normally refer to as skin, everything that covers your outside. The outer layer is called Epidermis, which roughly translates to outer skin. The top part is essentially dead cells that hardened to a degree and server as a shield. The part underneath replenishes these cells as they fall off iver time. The dermis is the next layer containing the hair, blood vessels, nerve endings, etc. it mostly consist out of connective tissue, giving the skin its elasticity.

The Mucosa is your internal skin. It‘s quite similar to regular skin, but a bit different. The top layer is called epithelial cells. Where skin builds a layer of dead cells for protection , mucosa secretes a slimy substance. Under that is the lamina propria, which is similar to the dermis. Its the underlying connective tissue that also has blood vessels, etc.

The junction between those two is called mucocutaneous junction. These are the areas where skin transitions to mucosa. In humans those areas are lips, nostrils, conjuntivae (inside part of the eyelids), urethra, vagina, foreskin and anus.

And now onto why we are this way:

Evolution started off as single cells. Over time those single cells became more complex and complex. Eventually they were too large to become even larger for the most part. So some cells attaches to one another, forming colonies.

The first large colonies where little balls of cells with a hollow inside. At some point however they folded in. Like you pushed your finger into a soft ball. Now this ball has two layers, the one facing outside and the one facing inside, as well as an opening. 

This colony became more and more complex. Eventually the inside layer became less protective, using slime to keep itself safe. Its purpose was processing the food. The outside layer became harder and more resilient. This happened in countless different ways.

This pattern exists until today. The inner and outter skin are fairly similar but adapted to different features."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why are we not cloning animals before they go extinct, like the Yangtze giant softshell turtle that just lost its last female?","Because cloning is an imperfect and expensive technology that often doesn't work as well as we would hope it does.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How do cars measure fuel level accurately when the fluid is constantly sloshing around?,Modern fuel tanks have a partition that envelopes the float to minimize sloshing (think of a harbor where a jetty comes out to minimize ocean waves).

explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: If I have 2% neanderthal genes, can we say x generation back one of my ancestors was a 50% neanderthal?","Actually, it means at least one (and maybe quite a few) of your ancestors was completely neanderthal and had a child with a modern human, and of course all of their ancestors would be neanderthal.  However that doesn't lead to a simple time line for when the populations mingled.  If a population of 1000 sapiens absorbed a population of 20 neanderthals, after a while the proportion of neanderthal genes in everybody in that population might stabilize at 2% and might stay at that level for many generations.  Or, the percentage could rise or fall depending on if those genes had positive or negative effect on survival and reproduction."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 What does the universe being not locally real mean?,"Classic physics assumes that things exist in the way that we perceive them.  That is to say, if I have an apple sitting on a table, classic physics assumes that the apple has a fixed position (on the table) and a fixed speed (sitting still) and that these are absolute, 100% true values.

In reality, things only look that way because humans are gigantic compared to subatomic particles, and at human scales things do behave in a predictable manner.

On subatomic scales this isn't true.  All fundamental particles have a sort of dual existence.  If you could somehow freeze time for a particle, then while it is frozen in time it will have the absolute properties that classic physics ascribes to it.  IE, that particle would have a fixed position and speed.  

So if you imagined the universe as a strip of movie film, where each frame was a distinct moment in time, you could theoretically capture a particle's position and speed in each of those frames.  But what about in between the frames?  The answer is that in between frames, the particle ceases to exist in the way that we understand existence.

In between frames, particles exist as a probability.  So imagine that frame 1 had a particle in position 0, traveling forward at a speed of 1.  In frame 2, the overwhelming majority of the time, the particle will appear to have advanced by 1 and moved to position 1.  However, that's not always true.  

The particle will rarely advance by 2 and move to position 2 or advance by 0 and stay in position 0.  It will even sometimes move backwards by 1 and end up in position -1.  This also means that particles can teleport through one another.  

So for example, if our particle was at position 0 and another particle was at position 1, sometimes our position 0 particle will move to position 2 despite the fact that it *should* have been blocked by the particle at position 1.

Even if you know everything about a particle at a given point in time, that isn't enough information to *know* where that particle came from in the past, or where it will be in the future.  Particles have an element of randomness to their movement that makes them unpredictable, which is what physicists are talking about when they say that the universe isn't locally real.

The universe appears to be locally real to us, as humans, because this randomness is affecting particles that are very, very, very small.  An electron is about the same relative size to you as you are to the entire universe.  Because all of this randomness is happening on such a tiny scale, it ends up cancelling itself out to give the appearance of a fixed reality.

So what does this all mean?  You can know what the position and speed of an apple sitting on your desk is.  But in the real world where you can't just freeze time, it is impossible to know what the exact position and speed of any of the subatomic particles that make up the apple are because those particles don't really have a fixed position and speed as humans typically understand those concepts."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why are radiators in houses often situated under a window- surely this is the worst place and the easiest way to lose all the heat?,"It's because the cold windows are the greatest heat loss from the room and the radiator under the window causes a rising current of warmed air in front of the window. It counteracts the cold down draught generated by the cold window.

If you were to put the radiator on the opposite internal wall (as seems logical) then you'd get the warm air rising to the ceiling, flowing across the ceiling and a descending draught of cold air flowing down past the window and across the floor. The warm up-draught from the radiator and the cold down-draught from the glazing would reinforce each other, The strong cold draught flows across the floor. People are most sensitive to cold draughts around their ankles.

It was more important in the days of single glazing and steel window frames.

TLDR:  Radiators are placed under windows so that the rising warm air will counteract the cold down draught generated by the glazing. If the radiator were on the opposite internal wall, the cold down-draught and the warm up-draught would reinforce each other, which may prove uncomfortable."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 Why does the moon have so many craters when Earth doesn't have, even though Earth's gravity is stronger and it should be the one attracting the comets?","Three reasons:

1) The atmosphere. Only the bigger rocks can punch through it to even create a crater

EDIT:1.5) Oceans. They're 70% of the earth's surface. If a meteorite manages to make a crater on the ocean's floor, it goddamn earned it.

2) Erosion. Surface features on earth get worn away. Mountains get turned to sand, depressions filled sediment. A lot of craters are actually still there (like the famous dinosaur killer Chicxulub crater), but invisible to the naked eye. I guess this is also 2.5) vegetation and water.

3) Plate tectonics. A lot of craters don't exist anymore, because the crust they were punched into doesn't exist anymore.

The moon lacks all of those. Any feature on it's surface will stay there."

The truck will have a regular steering wheel ""meep"" horn like a car, but its not much louder than a car's.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do ICBM early warning systems differentiate between a real threat and a launch of a normal rocket intended to go to space?,"The early stages of a rocket launch is identical to an ICBM launch. It actually used to be the same rockets and a few are still dual use. But an ICBM shuts down its engines when it is still on a suborbital flight. This usually happens before ten minutes into the launch. An orbital launch however keep the engines on until it reaches an orbit. In some cases there is just seconds in difference. But this does indeed mean that you have to wait about ten minutes before you can be sure if it is an orbital launch or an ICBM launch. And by that time it might be too late to stop all warheads.

Another less reliable indicator is the heading of the rocket. Due to the speed you can not really change the direction of a rocket once it is fired so an ICBM have to be fired towards its target from the start. Orbital rockets can be launched into any number of orbits but they tend to be fired either straight east or straight north or south. So even before ten minutes you can get an idea of what the rocket is based on where it is heading.

It is also unlikely that an ICBM attack only include one launch. This would do limited damage and the rocket defenses would not need much advance notice to shoot the few warheads down. So a single rocket launch is likely not an ICBM but if they see more launches at the same time it is more likely to be an ICBM attack rather then an orbital launch.

But the most important indicator is that rocket launches are planned out well in advanced and is therefore published long before it happens. The people manning the early warning systems is therefore briefed about the launch and know what to expect. They still monitor the launch and look for any deviations but their assumption is that it is an orbital launch and not an ICBM."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: what’s that tingling sensation you get in your tummy when you go up down in an amusement park ride?,"""Air time"" has a strange effect on your body because your body is not completely solid — it is composed of many parts. When your body is accelerated, each part of your body accelerates individually. The seat pushes on your back, the muscles in your back push on some of your organs and those organs push on other organs. That's why you feel the ride with your entire body. Everything inside is being pushed around.

Normally, all the parts of your body are pushing on each other because of the constant force of gravity. But in the ""free-fall"" state of plummeting down a hill, there is hardly any net force acting on you. In this case, the various pieces of your body are not pushing on each other as much. They are all, essentially, weightless, each falling individually inside your body. This is what gives you that unique sinking feeling in your stomach; your stomach is suddenly very light because there is less force pushing on it. The same thing happens when you drive down a dip in the road in your car or descend in an elevator moving at high speed.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: if given enough heat will diamond melt into liquid like glass why or why not ?,"Disclaimer: The specific numbers might be off, but the general point being made still stands. Carbon is a weird material.

In short: If it's **just** heat being applied, then no, a diamond will not 'melt.'

This is because diamonds are made of pure carbon, which, at standard surface air pressure (what you're experiencing right now) does not have a liquid phase. Let's look at three potential examples.

If you heat a diamond in the open air, it will eventually (at a temperature around 850 degrees Celsius or 1562 Fahrenheit, even lower if there's more oxygen available) just burn. This happens as the carbon reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere and binds with it, burning the diamond until all you're left with is carbon dioxide gas.

If you instead heat the diamond in a vacuum (while this happens gradually at any temperature, the temperature 1900 degrees Celsius/3452 degrees Fahrenheit is where this really speeds up) it becomes graphite. Diamonds are made of pure carbon that binds under immense pressure and heat, resulting in a sort of cage-like crystal structure (the shape the carbon atoms take when bound) made up of carbon atoms that are each bound to four other carbon atoms in a repeating series. Reheating these bonds in a vacuum without recreating the pressure just destabilizes them and converts them into the other pure form of carbon: graphite. Graphite's crystal structure is made up of carbon atoms that are each bound to *three* other carbon atoms in a flat layer that stacks upon itself. The bonds between layers are very, very weak and layers will separate from simple friction, which is why graphite is so great for writing. If you keep heating the material even further (to around 3726.88 Celsius/6740.33, you'll wind up with carbon gas as the graphite sublimates (the process of matter going directly from a solid to a gaseous state).

Now, if you instead set up an environment with a noble gas (or something else that won't chemically react with the carbon and burn it) and (somehow) increase the pressure to an extreme degree (to roughly 98692.3 times the typical pressure you feel on Earth's surface) and ramp the heat up to 4500 degrees Celsius/8132 degrees Fahrenheit, you will see a diamond melt. This is because carbon required both an immensely high temperature and pressure to enter its liquid state. I'm not sure as to whether molten carbon would be similar to molten glass, though."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why does it disturb the healing when we pop our acne, but it's fine when dermatologists extract it for us?","Think about when you pop a balloon. You just squeeze and squeeze until part of it fails. It usually tears the balloon apart and sometimes it is in several pieces afterwards. 

Now try this, or look it up on Youtube: if you put a few layers of tape on the balloon, then carefully poke a hole through the tape with a sharp needle, the hole will not spread and the balloon will slowly, gently deflate. It'll stay in one piece.

That's the difference between popping a pimple and a doctor using surgical tools to drain it. They use sterile, sharp tools to do as little damage as possible. Your fingers and fingernails are the surgical equivalent of a broken glass bottle and a hammer."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does a second last... well... a second?,"Dividing an hour into 60 parts was pretty common in the ancient world, because 60 is a number that divides evenly into many fractions - 1/3, 1/4, 1/2, 1/6. In fact this sexagesimal type of math was pretty common in the ancient world for this reason. Further dividing the minute into 60 seconds is just a logical progression of that. However, people in the pre-modern world would have used relative hours - that is, they counted twelve hours between sunrise and sunset and evenly divided them. This meant that hours were shorter in the winter and longer in the summer, so minutes and seconds would be longer and shorter as well. 

It wasn't until mechanical clocks that the period of the second became standardized as 1/60 of 1/60 of an hour (or 1/24 of the solar day)."

What you _can't_ do is empty it twice today and skip emptying it tomorrow - by the end of the third day, trash will be overflowing everywhere.  No matter how many times you empty it in a day, it still can only hold one day's worth of trash.  You can't build up an ""empty trash"" surplus."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 Why are there almost no words in English containing the letter combination ""zh"", despite the fact that that the sound is quite common, e.g. ""measure""?","It's all about where that sound comes from, historically. As many comments have pointed out, almost all instances of /ʒ/ (or ""zh"" as you write it) are written with an S. That's no coincidence. Have you ever thought it was weird that ""s-i-o-n"" and ""t-i-o-n"" are pronounced ""zhun"" and ""shun""? That's certainly not what the letters would appear to be saying. You might expect those to sound like ""syun"" or ""tyun"" (assuming you're comfortable with turning unstressed consonants into /ə/ - the vowel in ""dumb"", which is super common in English).

And actually, they WERE said like ""syun"" and ""tyun"", but as it turns out, English speakers really hate that Y sound in the middle of their words. So they take the /j/ (the first sound in ""yellow"". I know, using a j is confusing but these symbols are international) sound and basically combine it into the preceding consonant. We can see that in tons of examples:

- Statue: Statyu? More like Stachu.
- Mission: Misyun? More like Mishun.
- Leisure: Leezyur? More like Leezhur.
- Vision: Vizyin? More like Vizhun.
- YouTube: Yootoob? More like Yoochoob.

""But wait!"" You might be thinking. ""That last one isn't right! I say 'Yootoob' like it's written!"" If so, congrats, you're probably American. But much of Britain now says ""Yoochoob"", which is just the next in a long line of slow morphs in the English language. Because in ~~the British accent~~ (can't believe I actually wrote that, I should know better) *certain British accents*, it would typically be ""Yootyoob"", and there's that pesky middle Y again that we hate so much. The fact is, pronunciation changes a lot faster than spelling, especially in a world as modernized as this one. 

There's a really nice video on the topic from Dr. Geoff Lindsay [here](https://youtu.be/RRs103ETh2Q). I'm always happy to recommend his videos for linguistic questions, dude is a genius. He covers the ""ch"" case, rather than the ""zh"" case, but it's got virtually identical reasoning.

Oh, and PS: as another commenter mentioned, ""zh"" is most common in transcribing Chinese languages, it's fairly modern. China uses that sound in places that couldn't possibly have combined with the /j/ sound, like ""Zhang"". I challenge you to find an English word without Chinese origins that has the ""zha"" *(to clarify, I'd be interested in specifically /ʒæ/, like the middle of the phrase ""beige axe"". Several people have already given examples of /ʒʌ/ and /ʒa/)* sound in it (and no cheating, the ""dzha"" in words like ""jab"" doesn't count).  Maybe if English had developed with more Chinese influence, ""zh"" would be more common. 

Update: several people, more knowledgeable about Mandarin pinyin than I, have informed me that the above usage of ZH does not correlate well at all with the English phoneme /ʒ/. Now that's gotten me curious, whether English speakers just slowly mutated the /ʈʂ/ it represents into /ʒ/ (which feels weird, since it's much more in line with the English CH sound /tʃ/) or if that association of the letters ZH came from a completely different source and Mandarin has nothing to do with it.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Is a ""good"" singing voice determined by genetics? If so, can someone with a terrible singing voice overcome their genetics with training to sound pleasant and professional?","As you put ""good"" in quotes, I think that you already have an idea.

Genetics certainly plays a role in an individual's physiognomy. The voice is ultimately produced by a physical part of the body so genetics is definitely involved. 

Here it might be useful to break the problem down. 

1) There are physical limitations that can be improved with training and exercise and knowledge of how to best use what we have. Broadly speaking, doing vocal training will make nearly anyone sing ""better"". Better, in this sense, is producing tone evenly and in control, with less stress and developing the muscles and techniques to best utilize voice. It is ""technical"" training. 

2) Musicality and musical talent is another thing. A trained vocalist can make sound properly but that is separate from their musical instinct and knowledge. This is the ""artistic"" part of being a singer. Exposure, experience, curiosity and motivation play a big role here. There are many singers (popular) who have little training and perhaps even ""bad"" voices but use their ability and develop their own style and preference and make it musical. 

One of the greatest examples of this is Carole King. She is a tremendously talented and prolific songwriter. And she has one of the most popular albums ever (Tapestry). She actually has a pretty ""lousy"" voice objectively examined. She has limited vocal range, tends to screech slightly on high notes, raspy on the lows and doesn't really hold notes very well or with support. But her artistry is off the charts."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why were some ancient cities like Palmyra and Machu Picchu left to ruin and fall apart over hundreds of years instead of being repopulated?,"Machu Picchu wasn't really a city so much as an Imperial estate.  It had some significance to the Incan rulers, but exactly what this was isn't known.  

It was abandoned when Spanish invasions of Incan territory put stress on their government, and never recolonized because it had existed to serve the Incan rulers, and there were no more Incan rulers.  The location wasn't really suited for any other purpose, like trade or agriculture or mining

Palmyra has a long history stretching all the way back to the stone age.  It actually still is populated today, although it's not exactly a major city.  People lived  (and still live) at Palmyra because there's water...it's an oasis in the middle of the Syrian desert.  But Palmyra's heyday happened when lots of trade was occurring across the region....it's a convenient stop on the trade routes between the Eastern Mediterranean and  Mesopotamia, and located in a sort of no-man's land between the Roman and Persian empires.  

So Palmyra got very wealthy off trade, and was able to maintain some independence...at least until Rome sacked it and destroyed it.  But it was too convenient a spot to remain empty forever (unlike Machu Picchu) and so eventually the Romans rebuilt it as a smaller settlement.  It survived off trade for longer, but the Timurids sacked it in 1400 and after that it was basically just a village.  The reason it never grew back into a city is probably because of shifting patterns of trade. Not long after this time, overland trade between Europe and Asia shifted more to seaborn trade as European sailors started sailing around Africa.  As a result, there was no longer a strong economic reason to rebuild the city again and it remained a village.

This is the usual story with abandoned cities.  They are usually repopulated if the original reason that they were built is still there. But if whatever driving motivation goes away, a destroyed city is often not resettled."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Where did the ongoing ‘do a good deed and the mayor of the town congratulates you with the key to the city’ in movies & shows come from? Was that ever a real thing?,"The ""key to the city"" comes from serfdom, where it was originally called the ""freedom of the city,"" meaning that the honored person was to be treated as a free person, not a serf, while they were in the city. The ""key to the city"" derives from the custom of walled cities closing and locking their gates up at night; if you wanted to enter, you'd either have to wait until morning or convince a guard that you had an important enough reason to open the gates. However, if you have a ""key"" to the gates, that meant that you could open them whenever you wished; you had the freedom to enter/exit the city as you desired. Hence, the ""key to the city"" phrase replaced ""freedom of the city"".

It is entirely symbolic/honorific. Since serfdom is long gone, there are no privileges or protections to be gained by not being a serf, so getting a ""key to the city"" is just an indicator that the city government appreciates something you've done."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5, why is going to bed super late bad for you if you still get the same amount of sleep?","Your body has expected events it wants to do every night. Think of it like your going to bed routine. You brush your teeth, you floss your teeth, you wash your face, then you get into bed, and you turn off the lights.

Your body does much the same - it has a ton of physical work to do while you sleep. It knows what to do based on an internal clock. If you throw off your internal clock by not sleeping at the expected times it can cause that long to-do list to go partially undone. 

If your body can't do it's to-do list at night fully, over multiple nights, you end up exhausted. Exhaustion causes you to get sick more easily, make careless errors,and physical injuries go up. Over years you increase your risk of dementia.

Eventually, if you redefine your bed time for long enough, your body will realize that it needs to do the to-do list at a different time. The chemical message runners will start to change their schedules to suit your sleep schedule. However, people who work at night tend to gain weight, have more depression and anxiety, and acquired diabetes. Your body can only adapt so much.

It's best to fall asleep when you feel naturally tired and wake up when you feel naturally rested. For some people that's 9pm, some it's 11pm, some it's 2am. There's no perfect schedule. Our society isn't too friendly to this fact."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How do hackers take down a major corporation like MGM Resorts and not get immediately caught?,"I think there's a bad amount of Hollywood-itis at play here. Warning that this is going to be much more ""Explain like I'm 12"".

First of all, the chance that these hackers are in the US is essentially zero. They're probably in a country that's not on good terms with the US (and as such doesn't have an active extradition treaty) such as Iran, China, Russia, etc. Even if investigators knew exactly who they were, catching them may very well be impossible because they're outside of actionable jurisdiction.

Second, determining where they are is hard. In the US, where ISPs are well-regulated, it's still possible to slip through the cracks via VPNs. In countries where IP addresses are just sorta willie-nillie, or someone can accumulate a bunch by using prepaid phone SIMs for internet access, it goes from slipping through cracks to walking in a wide open canyon.

Third, it could be something that's not even network-based so it ends up being entirely innocuous.

 We call planets like Saturn gas giants, but they do have solid surfaces underneath thousands of miles of gaseous atmosphere.    And there is so much of this gas that it makes an insanely high pressure at the solid surface.  This not only provides enough pressure to produce diamonds, but all of that pressure also creates a lot of heat.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How and why can some metals like copper be antibacterial?,"It is important to remember that bacteria and cells aren't like us. Humans, and most multicellular creatures, have a layer of skin as protection. This prevents harmful chemicals from getting inside of us and doing damage.

Bacteria don't really have skin. They have a membrane which constantly passes chemicals through it. A good analogy is that we have a mouth, a butt hole, and a lot of skin. Bacteria don't have the skin so they are 100% mouth and butt hole everywhere.

There are things that we can touch but not put in our mouths. Since bacteria are 100% mouths, touching something is exactly the same as putting it in their mouth.

The second big thing to remember is that all living things are essentially just chemical processes. You put two molecules next to each other and things start to happen. All living things are essentially the universe's largest Rübe Goldberg machines.

So, what happens is that when the bacteria touch the copper they, effectively, put it in their mouths and the copper atoms go in and wreak havoc on the carefully balanced chemical dancer inside the cell.

Anti-microbial surfaces of all types work by either being so slippery that bacteria can't hold onto them or toxic to bacteria in this way.

As to how chemicals can interfere in the cell. The process of chemical reactions in a cell is similar to a lock and key. ""Toxic"" chemicals are usually ones that fit a lock in a cell better than the actual key. Once they fit into the lock, the real key can't go in and the chemical chain that keeps the living cell/bacteria stops running."

1. It makes writing cheats & hacks easier. When you have the source code it's easier to search through and find exploits in the code that could be used to cheat in multiplayer. No one likes cheaters, and no one wants to make it easier for people to cheat.

2. It reveals trade secrets. Leaked source code contains a lot of proprietary information that other developers could potentially steal and incorporate into their own games. While this might seem like a good thing for gamers, it's not particularly good for the people who make them.

3. It lifts the veil on how shitty your project managers are, and dispells any bullshit you tried to peddle to your players about why certain bugs didn't get fixed, and why things are the way they are. In other words, it makes the devs look bad.

4. It totally breaks any and all offline DRM protection, no matter how good it may be. When you have the full source code, you can simply remove the DRM from the source code and compile a custom version of the game that has no DRM protection. Put simply, leaked source code is the absolute best way to create a pirated copy of a game.

5. It creates security threats to the players. Following from my last point, pirated versions of the game could potentially contain malware embedded in the game's code that would be difficult for antivirus to detect. And following from my 1st point, leaked source code could also reveal certain exploits in the netcode that can potentially expose legitimate players to remote hacks from a bad actor in a multiplayer session."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do odors/smells have physical mass?,"Anything that is matter has mass. A fart or a smell is just molecules like the oxygen or nitrogen in the air.

In the case of farts, most of the gas (\~75%)  is hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Those don't have much of a smell, but there's also usually a tiny bit (<1%) of sulphur-containing gases that stink terribly. They're gases, not poop dust, so particles might be a bit misleading in this context. We're not talking ""intestinal solids"".

Farts range from 10 - 400 mL in volume, and the fart gas happens to weigh roughly 1 g/L, so a fart weights 10-400 mg. By comparison, a grain of rice weighs about 29 mg.

Other smells are typically gases too. They are organic molecules that stick to proteins in our noses and stimulate nerves that our brain interprets as smells."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how did propellor warplanes shoot their machine guns through the propellor?,"Oh this is actually very cool.

They would time the gun to a cam on the propellor axle, there was a little bump on the axle that would push the mechanism to fire the gun, but it was placed on the axle in a place that it would only push when the propellor was out of the way of the gun. This technique is used very often still in modern engines to time things properly.

This also kinda meant firing rate was dependent on the speed of the propellor turning."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5: At the most basic level, how is a computer programmed to know how long a unit of time is?","There are certain crystals that vibrate when we apply electricity to them. We can exploit that vibration to make a device that opens and closes an electrical switch as it vibrates. That sends a ""pulse"" of electricity and we call this a ""clock"".

The neat thing about these crystals is they vibrate at pretty much exactly the same frequency no matter what. So if we build a circuit that counts how many ""pulses"" have been sent, we know when it reaches a certain number 1 second has passed. We can use math to figure out smaller units of time.

The CPU in a computer already has to have a ""clock"" line. That periodic on and off pulsing is what tells it to perform its next instruction, it's kind of like turning the crank on a jack in the box. So it can count these ""cycles"" to have an idea of the passage of time."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is the fabric of space bendable but also not visible by eye.,"The idea is that we *do* see it: we see objects with no other forces acting upon them seeming to change direction, and we see light bend as if curved spacetime acts like a lens. The reason planets don't lose momentum to friction as they move through curved spacetime is the same reason objects in motion remain in motion traveling in straight lines through flat spacetime: the objects aren't rubbing against anything, and they're not being deflected either. 

If you take a piece of graph paper and draw the graph for Y=X you'll get a straight diagonal line. If you pick that paper up and roll it, now it looks like your line is going around in a spiral. But from the line's perspective, it hasn't changed direction: it's just following the same straight line, only now on curled paper."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is that weird 'milk skin' that forms on top of milk after boiling it?,"Proteins in the milk lose their solubility as the result of heat, and coagulate or come together to form a sticky film that floats on top of the liquid milk.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do we fly across the globe latitudinally (horizontally) instead of longitudinally?,"It's called a [Polar Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_route) and they are somewhat common. If a route would be far shorter going over the artic, they do just that.

However, the risk of going over the artic is there are very few airports up there. So if a plane needs to make an unscheduled landing they have far fewer options. So if a flight path is similar, or a little longer, but it flies over more populated areas, the airlines will choose that route."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why did we go from calling sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?,"I think it is just slightly more technically correct for what we want to talk about.

My understanding is that:

* A 'disease' is generally thought to be the collection of symptoms that someone suffers.
* An 'infection' is generally thought to be some pathogen/germ in/on your body.

They are linked, but not exactly the same.

* For instance, you can be infected, but not show symptoms yet.
* Or you can be infected, but only be a 'carrier' and never experience the disease itself, only spread the infection to others.
* (EDIT: and, while I think not the case for sexually transmitted problems, many diseases are not caused by infection.)

So if we talk about STDs, what if someone is infected but hasn't got the disease yet, or are only a carrier? Should we say they are ""STD free""? Technically that's true, but it is misleading. If we say they ""have an STD"" well, that gives a better idea, but is technically false.

If we move the focus to infection, that might be more useful, and avoid risk of confusion there."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How come just a 2 degrees increase of body temperature can make you feel so fatigue and like you’re dying?,"Your body has an internal set point to maintain temperature. There is some minor fluctuation throughout the day, but usually no more than +/- 1 degree.

When you have an infection, your body may decide to raise the set point. This has the huge benefit of increasing the effectiveness of the immune system.

Mounting an immune response takes up a lot of the body’s resources. This, and the damage being done by the invader, are what make you feel lousy."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - How do airports and other public venues keep hackers from setting up fake WiFi networks?,"In theory, well-built setups can look for ""fake"" hotspots and basically drown them out.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why does the Panama Canal have canal locks while the Suez Canal doesn't have any?,"The Panama Canal travels through some very challenging terrain, and so the canal would either need to raise/descend in elevation along with the terrain, or otherwise would need to be dug extremely deeply in some locations. They chose the lock method to raise and lower the canal sections as it moved through the elevation changes. The Suez canal doesn't have these elevation changes and so could be dug at a consistent elevation without difficulty."
explainlikeimfive,[ELI5] why is dry firing a bow so bad for it? Does the arrow really make that much of a difference in that regard?,"When you loose an (appropriate for the bow) arrow, effectively all the energy stored in the bow goes into the movement of the arrow. With a properly tuned bow and arrow, the bow should basically be at rest in your hand after the arrow flies, no vibrations or forward movement.

If you dry fire a bow, all that energy is NOT going into an arrow. There's nothing slowing down the limbs untill they're abruptly and violently stopped by the string, which itself isn't elastic. So it's sort of like you took the bow and smashed it against the wall. I think you can see from that analogy why the bow might get damaged."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why do flies rub their hands together after they land?,"They are cleaning themselves. 

Flies smell and taste through their feet and every time they land (technically, that's what they do half of the time) they get their feet dirty. The rubbing is their way of blowing their nose and brushing their teeth so they can smell/taste whatever it is they are standing upon."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do planets orbit at the same level as each other?,"1) It's because it's the net momentum of the entirety of the solar system. Initially it was all chaos with orbits all around 3D space in both directions. But as objects hit each other, they naturally tend to the overall net momentum of the whole system. 

See for example [2:50 of this video](https://youtu.be/MTY1Kje0yLg?si=dbTwYx3xXhhLUJbx&t=168). Notice how at first, they are all orbiting at different directions, but eventually, they all tend to the same direction. The same effect happens even in 3D space.

2) It is not perfectly horizontal. There are some deviations. [Especially as you get further out into the solar system.](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a5f76425b453b2fb0edcec8e579d6a92-lq)"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how do astronauts deal with explosive diarrhea,"It's happened at least once, on Apollo 8. On Day 2, Frank Borman became ill, with vomiting and diarrhea.

explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why do hangovers get worse with age?,"MD here. Your body becomes less able to deal with the stress alcohol puts on the body over time. Alcohol causes something called oxidative stress, and also dehydration by acting directly on a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. In addition, as you age, the protective layer of mucus in the stomach is less effective, and alcohol can cause injury to the lining of the stomach. In fact, any part of the body that alcohol touches can become irritated or inflamed. The mouth all the way to the intestines, the throat, etc. It is also my understanding that alcohol consumption can cause low blood sugar because it depletes a compound called NAD+ which is necessary in the body to produce sugar from other compounds, which the brain may be more sensitive to at old age."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how do architects calculate if a structure like a bridge is stable?,"Civil Engineer here. There are plenty of great answers here that dig into a lot of important details, but in the spirit of ELI5, I will try to do specifically that...

Different parts of a structure will be pushed or pulled or twisted in different ways depending on a bunch of different factors. This pushing, pulling, or twisting can cause things to break. An engineers job is to figure out all of the different pushes, pulls, and twists the structure will have to deal with under the most extreme cases, figure out what parts are most likely to break, and then choose the proper shapes, sizes and materials of all the parts to make sure nothing breaks under the most extreme cases."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5- when to use she in a sentence so it's grammatically correct, like why is ""this is she"" correct but ""this is her"" isn't correct?","If you talk about someone that is doing something, then you say ""she"".

If you talk about something that is happening to someone, then the someone becomes ""her"".

The verb ""to be"" is a special case because it acts like an equals sign in maths. I can say ""this = she"" and ""she = this"" because of how we use the verb in English grammar. Saying ""her is..."" is not correct and so we shouldn't say ""this is her"" if we're being correct."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5 - Why do some obese men get rock hard giant bellies, but you rarely if ever see rock hard bellies on obese women?","Women tend to get subcutaneous fat - on top of the muscle just under the skin. This makes our fat seem soft and squishy. 

When men put on fat it tends to be visceral fat. Visceral fat forms under the muscle and around the organs. So the muscle over top is still “hard” to the touch even with an equivalent amount of fat underneath."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how is it possible for computer chips to have billions of transistors?,"they are really really small.  In most computers, a transistor is only about 70 ATOMS wide, or about 5 nanometers. at that scale, a 2d plane of transistors that is only 1 square millimeter would hold about 40 billion transistors (assuming they are square).  naturally you cant pack them that tight in the real world.

the way we manufacture this is literally using magic crystals, alchemy, and sunlight.  UV light is shone through a slide like old slide projectors would use.  this slide contains a pattern for a single layer of the chip.  this projection of a pattern is then fed backwards through what is effectively a microscope which makes the whole design the size of a single area of a single chip.  This is then shone into a UV sensitive coating on a silicon crystal and causes take on the microscopic pattern special ""doping"" chemicals are then spread over the chip and they soak through into the silicon where the coating is missing changing the properties of the silicon crystal.  Rinse and repeat with a new projector pattern.  This builds up microscopic layers 1 layer at a time.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5:How come sexual assault is one of hardest crime to prosecute vs every other crime?,"One of the biggest factors in a case like that is whether or not the victim consented, and that can be incredibly hard to prove without any physical evidence of resistance.

Sexual Assaults don't generally happen in a public area with lots of witnesses who can say for sure the victim wasn't interested in the perpetrator. Usually they happen behind closed doors, or in an out of the way place where no one would catch them in the act. But the same can also be said about consensual sex acts. While many victims can, and do, fight back leaving physical marks on their attacker, these heal over time and unless the suspect is caught before that happens, you'll never know they were fought against.

This means a sexual assault case ends up being one persons word against another. As a rule, courts tend to avoid throwing a potentially innocent person into jail even if that means a criminal goes free, so the case gets dismissed."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are train tracks laid on top of gravel? And not on something more sturdy such as concrete?,"Railway ballast (the technical term for the gravel), has some properties which make it better than a solid foundation such as concrete.

Its largely self levelling, handles vibration better (vibrations can cause damage to concrete, and heavier trains cause more vibrations), has natural drainage (concrete would need drainage channels built into it during construction), copes with vegetation better (roots can break up concrete) and is trivial to lay and replace (can literally be done in minutes, and on a continuous basis - concrete would need time to set before you can lay the rails on it)."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Im not from Europe. Can someone explain what are the Balkans exactly and why there's ""beef"" between them?","Answer: the Balkans are the peninsula in southeast europe. The area has a lot of mountainous terrain, and has experienced overlays of many different types of people throughout history. So there are many pockets of different types of cultures.

Part of the reason there is so much conflict today, is that the area has always been a sort of crossroads. There were the Illyrians in Roman times, Slavs in the 8th and 9th centuries, Magyars came in to Hungary, and then Ottomans during the time of their empire.

The split between Eastern and Western Roman empires went right through roughly the Croatia/Bosnia/Serbia area. Which meant that to the east they were Eastern Orthodox, and to the West they were Catholic. To this day Croats are Catholic and Serbs are Eastern Orthodox. When the Ottomans attempted to come into Europe, they left pockets of Muslim peoples, primarily now in Bosnia and Kosovo. Then there were periods with the Austrio-Hungarian and Venetian Empires, and Greece. 

As others have mentioned, there's been a lot of recent history as well, but effectively the bones of conflict are simply very different groups of people, living in very close proximity to each other, with long histories of conflict."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how come Native North Americans didn’t have vast empires of wealth and cities like Montezuma had down in Mexico?,"The simple answer is: Access to resources.

Large settlements were established in areas that were resource plentiful. In North America this was in around the Mississippi River basin, the St.Lawrence river valley, and along the coast on either side. The Iroquois, for example, could very well be considered an empire. 

The plains people were typically more nomadic because their food sources travelled and weather patterns also drove what foods were available to forage. 

And further north it is simply too cold to support extremely large populations of human or animal and foraging is sparse at best.

In short: it always comes down to resource availability.

Further: not having to worry about resource availability then frees up time and energy for technological discoveries and advancement.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 why is the ocean salty, and how did it get that way?",Over millions of years water dissolved salts out of the ground.

explainlikeimfive,"eli5: I've heard orbit described as continuously falling past or missing the Earth, how then do objects in geosynchronous orbit above a single point not fall out of the sky?","The closer you are to the surface of the Earth, the faster you have to be moving sideways in order to “miss” the Earth as you fall.

As you get farther from the surface, the speed necessary to continuously “miss” the Earth drops.

The Earth is also rotating. Close to the surface, you have to be moving much faster than the surface of the Earth to stay in orbit. Very far away, you can move slower than the Earth turns and still stay in orbit.

Between those two points, there is a specific height where the speed necessary to stay in orbit results in you taking 24 hours to orbit the Earth. This is the same time it takes for the Earth to turn once on its axis, so assuming that the orbit is happening approximately above the equator, it will appear that the satellite is hovering above you to someone standing on the Earth.

But it’s not hovering. It’s still “falling past” the Earth. It’s just falling past at the same rate and in the same direction that the Earth turns."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is the Fibonacci sequence found everywhere?,"Actual mathematician here: the answers so far are all wrong, and so is your presumption. Fibonacci numbers are rare and there is no inherent mechanism in the universe for them.

Multiple answers have claimed it is all over nature, but examples of them appearing at all outside human works are pretty rare. They somewhat happen in sunflowers sometimes, if all the randomness of growth does not almost certainly screw it up. But that's about it. Beyond those rare few examples, it is usually esoteric and/or made up.

All the spiral patterns are not Fibonacci based, either. They are simply what we call _logarithmic spirals_, which have effectively nothing to do with the numbers. They are based on exponential growth, but that could be the powers of 2, 3, the golden ratio (~ Fibonacci numbers), 5, pi, and most importantly and most common, e.

When you encounter individual Fibonacci numbers, it is random chance. Especially with small numbers like 1,2 and 3, they just as well could be a million other sequences. And it it looks like it might be the golden ratio, it almost always might just as well be 1.5, 1.6, square root of 2 or 3, or a lot of other options. The uncertainty is usually very high, and often we even know that it is definitely _not_ that one number.

Some posts even compared the golden ratio and the Fibonacci numbers to pi. But unlike the former, pi has a lot of reasons to be everywhere in a physical reality. For example, the laws of nature do not change when you rotate things, hence a lot of optimal arrangements are ones that don't change with rotation as well: circles and spheres. Thus pi."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do anesthesiologists ask us to count back from 10 before going under?,"It gives you something to do while allowing the doc to watch the medications take effect. 

Induction for surgery differs a bit from what we do in the field but the concept is similar.

We start with an induction agent. This is designed to put you to sleep. It often has amnesia inducing effects which makes you stop making memories. 

Then once you’re asleep, we give a paralytic. This paralyzes your muscles so that we aren’t fighting against you. It gives us more control. It also prevents your digestive muscles from relaxing and spilling gastric contents into your airway. This is also why they tell you not to eat or drink after midnight. You can’t spill what’s not there.

You’re intubated, which involves using a curved tongue depressor looking object with a handle (and often a camera) to manipulate the tongue / airway structure and putting a tube into your trachea. This gives us a tube that we can use to breathe for you while your muscles are paralyzed (this means the muscles you use for breathing are also paralyzed, which means you’re not breathing during this). 

We take over your breathing with a machine. This is a ventilator, but can often be referred to as “life support.” 

We give you additional medications to keep you asleep. Depending on what medication we gave for induction, it may be the same, or it may be different. Similar but different. 

Now in the surgical world, they also worry about waking you up and all that. We don’t in the field. If we put you to sleep, weren’t not the ones waking you up.

Back to your original question. The easiest way to see how your induction medication is working is to just talk to the patient. Have them count out loud and you know they’re asleep when they stop counting. This isn’t always feasible for us. 

If we are intubating in the field, they’re usually really sick / hurt and they may not be able to talk. As such, I’ll poke the forehead and brush the eyelashes to determine whether our meds have kicked in. Each of those will elicit a response that will disappear with paralysis. Once your paralyzed, we intubate quickly and start breathing for the patient before they physiologically realize they aren’t breathing and start to respond accordingly.

Edit: Really long winded way of saying no, it doesn’t matter what order you count in. Once meds are pushed, everyone is just waiting for you to fall asleep. You can count forwards, backwards, sideways, list colors, or name the states in alphabetical order. No matter, once meds are pushed, you’ve got 10-20 seconds before you get sent to the best nap you’ve ever taken.

Edit 2: getting a lot of repeat questions.

Why doesn’t the paralytic stop the heart?

The paralytics we use target a specific receptor pathway / system that isn’t present in heart cells. Imagine of the medicine paralyzes everything in the body colored blue, but the heart is red.

Depends. Maybe. Maybe not. But probably. If you woke up with a cough or a sore throat, there’s a good chance you had something there."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 Moon looks different in each hemisphere?,"Yes, it appears upside in each hemisphere relative to the other. 

Imagine drawing a circle on the center of the ceiling of your room (easy if you have a skylight or similar!). Now stand against one wall and look up at it. You're looking up at an angle, so visually one side will appear ""higher"" - ie, the side closer to directly above you. Now move to the opposite wall - the side of the circle that is ""higher"" is opposite to before. But it's the same logic - it's the side closest to directly above you. 

The moon is the same - just very very far above everyone on the surface. The equator is (very approximately) like standing under it, and the further north or south you travel, the more you see the moon from an angle."

They often gave students a little bit of space (like a megabyte) to host their own webpages, presumably thinking PhD students would write something to do with their dissertations but of course were really just X-Files episode guides and REM fansites.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why does alcohol make stress and depression ""go away"" almost instantly but is making it worse in the long run?","There are multiple factors involved in this, but it comes down to neurotransmitter deficits, particularly your GABA system, and something called glutamate rebound. Searching for alcohol, gaba, and glutamate on YouTube will probably find a better video than I could explain. 

In essence though, your feel good chemicals are being withheld because of imbalance or damage, alcohol actually dumps a lot of these chemicals into the brain but without properly priming the systems that are supposed to. Then, when the alcohol ceases to do the job, the reservoir is empty because you’re body is rebounding and trying to restore the neurotransmitters and glutamate it took to make you feel that good. 

Over time, the problem is that the body stops producing that which it is having supplemented, so, if your neurotransmitters were already out of balance, then the alcohol makes it worse by giving your body another source of making this happen, so you just go deeper in the hole. 

It’s very similar to how opioid abuse downregulates endorphins so your body stops producing its own. Endorphins literally means morphine produced inside - same principle - that which comes from external sources will eventually be outsourced entirely = no more natural happy chemicals. Alcohol is just extra destructive because it’s also hard on liver and kidneys which play a key role in balancing neurotransmitters in the first place. 

This is why many people are turning to psilocybin (mushrooms), they can, in some cases, hack the internal system into producing more of the others because they mimic serotonin, BUT they carry high risks for paranoid disorders like schizophrenia and other disorders like bipolar can be exacerbated greatly. 

Neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, gaba, etc. are an incredibly delicate balancing act."

Yolks are also emulsifiers, meaning that they make it so that fats and water can mix; there's chemicals in yolks called lecithins that have a long oily bit that likes to be near fats at one end, and a charged bit that likes to touch water at the other, letting the fat and water to get close. The egg doesn't have a lot of tough stringy stuff holding it together like meat, and the water in there makes it easy to mix and pour.

The protein can be whipped so it unfolds and makes a foam that traps air. The protein in eggs also unfolds when cooked making it hold together things and trap in moisture. The yolks allow oil and water to mix so they won't separate (yay, mayonaise!) and are also very good at trapping in moisture, but have much less protein so they make for something softer and less rubbery.

This is based on this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03wwln-guestsafire-t.html

Basically, according to the historian in the article, single-letter words just looked weird to scribes in the olden days—like you made a mistake while writing or forgot the rest of the word.

The historian doesn't directly explain why ""a"" is okay lower case, but that might be because ""a"" is a much less ""important"" or ""weighty"" word. He suggests that, for those old scribes, ""I"" had too important a meaning to be written so small, so they just made it bigger, until it settled into being upper case.

It's also worth noting that, in Old English, ""I"" was not a single letter, and used to be ""ich"" or ""ic"", kinda like German (which English is in the same language family as). It got shortened over time."

It's actually the exact opposite of that. Prosecuters and defense attorneys generally prefer to use the least amount of witnesses possible because:

(a) Witnesses are people and people are unreliable, especially when put on the stand and are expected to tell a very specific story in front of a room full of people with the added pressure of telling your version of the story in a way that is convincing.

(b) Witnesses are subject to cross examination by the opposing attorneys.  Most witnesses are just regular people who have never been on the stand before and they lack experience in providing testimony. Meanwhile, the opposing attorney has a ton of experience in cross examination and can easily frame together a series of questions that will get the witness to contradict or at least cast doubt on their own testimony.  This can be especially hurtful to the prosecution and beneficial to the defense.

(c) Even expert witnesses who are brought in to testify about a very specific aspect to the case can be tripped up by an experienced attorney during cross examination. On top of that, expert witnesses can be very expensive, and if any level of govt is involved as a plaintiff or defendant, that cost is passed on to the taxpayer, so it's important that these types of witnesses are used as sparingly as possible."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 - How do people in prison get so jacked with terrible nutrition and no supplements?,"I work in a prison. While prison food generally doesn't taste great, it does have calories and protein. That can also be supplemented with the stuff they can buy on commissary (fish packs, chicken packs, cheese, etc). You don't need protein powder, it's just an easy way to get more nutrients.

Inmates also have the most important thing to getting big that most free people claim not to have: free time. I like to lift weights and do so a 3-4 times a week. But I also have other hobbies and responsibilities. Sometimes I skip a day. Sometimes Im not feeling it and don't hit it that hard. 

Inmates don't have other real hobbies and beyond following the rules, no real responsibilities. So a lot spend their time exercising. Gym and yard couple times a week.

Then there are also sleep cycles, each cycle is around ~~3 hours~~ 90 minutes long.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why oil doesn't get salty when adding salt to potatoes while frying?,"Salt does not dissolve in oil. 

Salt is a *polar* molecule because of its ionic bond. Normal sodium has one more electron than it wants and chlorine has one fewer. Unlike with *covalent* bonds, the two do not share an electron. Instead, the sodium atom gives it up and the chlorine atom takes it. This makes the sodium atom slightly positive and the chlorine atom slightly negative. Opposite charges attract, so they stick together like magnets. 

Water is also a polar molecule, although water is made with covalent bonds. The way the electrons are shared between the hydrogen and oxygen makes one side a little bit negative and the other a little bit positive. That makes water very good at dissolving other polar molecules. The positive sodium atom sticks to the negative side of one water molecule, and the negative chlorine atom sticks to the positive side of another water molecule, and the water rips the salt apart, carrying the two atoms away. 

Oils are nonpolar. The electrons are very evenly distributed so that there is no positive or negative side. That means there's nothing to grab onto the two atoms in the salt molecule and the salt won't dissolve."
explainlikeimfive,"[ELI5] Can one physically compress water, like with a cyclinder of water with a hydraulic press on the top, completely water tight, pressing down on it, and what would happen to the water?","Ok, so far everyone's given you the boring engineer answer that water is practically incompressible.

Key word *practically.* Rather than an engineer, let's think like a physicist and assume we have an indestructible vacuum-sealed press that has no limit on how much force it can output. What would happen?

Well, as much as water seems incompressible from our limited, primitive, earth perspective, one rule of physics is that everything is basically a gas when your forces are large enough. As you increased the pressure, your liquid water would slowly transition through several increasingly exotic forms of ice, characterized by different molecular structures. (You might envision ""ice"" as being cold, but rest assured it would get *very* hot and glowy)

...But let's really ramp things up. Once we're at several hundred million times the pressure of a real hydraulic press, the ice would start to undergo nuclear fusion. In other words, the electromagnetic force pushing atoms apart would no longer be able to oppose the pressure, and nuclei would begin to merge. At this point you basically have a small star in your hydraulic press

...But let's *really* ramp things up. If you increase the pressure another thousand trillion times or so, electrons can no longer maintain their energy levels, and their charge neutralizes with that of protons to leave only neutrons. Atoms don't exist as a whole anymore, and now we have all this empty space between nuclei, so we keep compressing. Ultimately, we get neutron degenerate matter. This is what neutron stars are made of. We've now compressed our ""water"" to the size of a handful of atoms, and at this point we're opposed by something called ""neutron degeneracy pressure"", which arises from the nuclear forces that hold quarks together.

If we apply more pressure to overcome this force, we get a black hole. It would be a tiny black hole, and thanks to Hawking radiation would evaporate into a burst of photons and neutrinos within less than a billionth of a second of its creation.

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 Why do birds have such twitchy movement?,"Have you ever watched how twitchy human eyes are when scanning?  Birds are essentially doing that with their entire head and body.  They have a much different field of view and different way of seeing the world.  Their eyes were less able to move or see around them...  or more importantly their ancestors had that.

Bird that takes in more information efficiently survives longer.  Reproduces.  Evolution and all.

Our brain and eyes do all those fast twitchy movements automatically and fill in the gaps to give us this illusion of one constant world around us.  They are just doing that.  

 Notice how the movements involving looking around are twitchy.  They have smooth motion further away from their heads.  Hopping and walking are smooth if you've ever seen it.

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 Why is water see through?,"It's a little bit backwards. Life needed to be able to see through water, so it created eyes that could see the light that water was clear to.

That might need some explanation. All things are ""clear"" to some kinds of light and ""opaque"" to other light. Like how an X ray can go right through your skin and see your bones. It's that way for all light, including visible light.

So there was always some wavelength of light that made water ""clear"". And some of those wavelengths are the visible light spectrum.

So when life evolved in the ocean, and eyes developed, it was very useful to be able to see the light that could pass through the water. And so you get eyes that can see in the ocean.

Edit: so the phrase I'd use for the actual 4 y/o is ""It's see-through because eyes were specially made to see through water"" or if you want it to sound more awesome but less helpful, ""because your eyes are like x-ray goggles for water"""
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why does a toothache seems unbearable compared to any other body ache?,"Dental student here, simplifying the answer as best as I can -

It's because the living, soft part of the tooth (the pulp) is at the core of the tooth structure. It's surrounded by layers of hard ""dead"" tissues (dentin and enamel)
It is literally surrounded by these hard tissues on more than 98% of its surface.

When the pulp gets infected, it doesn't have breathing space per se. It's in its own small chamber and pressure builds up because there is no proper escape for the decaying tissue - hence it results in unbearable pain."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: When somebody dies of cancer, what exactly is the actual reason the body stops working?","Cancer is a general term we use to describe any disease where cells in the body begin to divide in an uncontrolled fashion, often fast and with a very high mutation rate (so the cells begin to not look or function like those from the area of the body where they started). Cancer can be confined to a small area, or break off, travel through the blood stream, and lodge elsewhere to grow (we call that ""metastasis"" or ""spreading"").

Cancers kill by growing a bunch of the wrong cells in the wrong place. They can physically tear up organ tissue, block blood flow, cause internal bleeding, stop usable blood cells from being made... They effectively choke out organs to the point where the organs can't function and dies off. If the cancer has spread through the body, then many parts of the body will be failing at the same time.

Cancer death is typically due to organ failure, but the specifics of how it grows, the parts of the body affected, how it develops, etc. all depend on the particular type of cancer."

The trick is that the cells in your eyes that perceive the red wavelength are not working the way that you think.

They perceive mainly red at one end of the light spectrum, but are also slightly sensitive to the very opposite end of the spectrum, beyond blue, that's why you can perceive indigo there, and your brain perceives it as a mix of blue with a bit of red.

It kinds of gives you the illusion that the spectrum ""circles back"" to itself.

The purple color is kind of artificially created by the brain.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How was the ability to read hieroglyphs lost in time if there has been living people in Egypt since the pharaohs?,"In a sense, they didn't. It's more just that they got really really really mangled and simplified. But let's explain:

The specific form of writing we call ""hieroglyphs"" today weren't a commonly understood script back when they were used. Only the rich and well educated knew how to read them, because there were literally thousands of individual glyphs you had to learn to read.

When the poor eventually did learn to read, they weren't learning hieroglyphics. They were using what was, for lack of a better term, a simplified ""working man's"" version of hieroglyphs we call the ""proto-sinaitic script"".

Unalike hieroglyphs, proto-sinaitic was an abjad (consonant-only alphabet). Instead of having to learn multiple thousands of intricate characters to read and write, you had \~30, abstract shapes.

It was much easier for the layman to learn, and a lot more practical to use for leaving spur-of-the-moment notes, so it spread like wildfire. Imagine being able to talk to people, in the future, by memorizing about as many shapes as you have fingers and toes.

**Edit due to new info**: T'would seem Sinaitic wasn't the popular kid on the block in Egypt; That crown went to Hieratic, and eventually Demotic. They were the common forms of writing used by actual Egyptian speakers. Similar idea regardless, but I'm gonna dot my Is & cross my Ts.

That practicality lead to scholars using it to write, and the rest was history. The scratchy glyphs of proto-sinaitc eventually became the modern Latin alphabet you're reading right now, as well as things like Cyrillic, Arabic, and Syriac. Demotic meanwhile survives in the Coptic writing system.

So I guess in theory, you could argue that hieroglyphs never truly 'died'. They just look and act extremely different now.

That said, it seems like your underlying question is ""how do I drive stick"", and that we may be able to help a bit more with.

The thing that took me a bit to realize about driving stick is that when people say ""smoothly release the clutch"", they don't actually mean release the clutch at an even speed.  What they actually mean is release the clutch at an even speed until you feel a comfortable amount of engagement (ie your revs begin to change towards the new ratio and you feel a gentle acceleration), and then you hold it at that comfortable engagement until you feel that it's no longer slipping at all, and then at that point you can fully release (doesn't even need to be smooth at this point).  So if you were to graph the clutch pedal position over time the line would have a flat spot on it where the engine is getting to the right speed for the wheels."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 : why do manual motorcycle gear goes from 1>N>2>3>4>5>6 and not N>1>2>3>4>5>6,"It prevents accidentally going into neutral. I know it might sound weird but most riders aren't keeping track of what gear they're on. They just shift up and down as needed. A lot of the times just to make sure they're in first they'll click down until they can't any more. Since most are not keeping track it would be very common to accidentally go into neutral when coming to stops etc. The way it's placed between gears, and requiring half a click to get to it, means that you can only get into neutral deliberately. Keeping the rear wheel engaged with the gearbox is very important, freewheeling is almost never desirable in most cases, and even if it is the clutch can be used instead briefly."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 is it actually a lot worse to mouth breathe and why is it so bad?,"Former dental assistant here. 

Mouth breathing causes dry mouth, aka less saliva. Saliva helps to protect your teeth as it washes away harmful bacteria and whatnot in your mouth. With less saliva your mouth increases in acidity due to less saliva protecting your teeth. More bacteria=gingivitis=more decay. 

Also, the nose “filters” out a lot of impurities, dust etc, so when you’re breathing through your mouth you’re also breathing more impurities into  your mouth."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is the Southern Sea so rough?,The Earth rotates and this causes weather to tend to move west to east. This includes the powerful jet streams but also weather systems such as storms. Of course there are other factors involved in the movement of the weather systems so some do move in other directions but most of them tend to move from west to east. In the Pacific Ocean this means that most weather systems will end up close to the Americas where the land will slow them down. However in the Southern Sea there is no land to hit. The same storm can circle the Earth multiple times building up speed and power over time. That can make these storms enormous.
explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why does the U.S. need to import oil when we are the largest crude oil producer in the world?,"I have seen many partial answers to this here, largely because this is a very broad question. Trying to wrap this up into one. There are three main reasons with individual complexities:

1) Existing infrastructure was designed to use specific combinations of oil. Not all crude oil is the same, and the chemical properties vary significantly depending on which basin it was produced from. America produces primarily “light” oils while Canada and Russia produce “heavier” oils. American refinery infrastructure (the massive chemical plants that break the crude oil into gas, gasoline, diesel, heating oil, solids, etc.) was designed to refine a blend of lighter and heavier crude oil. Replacing this infrastructure, especially in the current American legislative environment, would be *extremely* expensive. 

2) The Jones Act: it is generally illegal to ship things from one U.S. port to another unless the vessel is domestically owned and flagged. Because the vessels must be owned, operated, and flagged domestically, the cost of operation increases dramatically to comply with environmental, labor, and safety laws. This is for a number of national policy reasons, but it does limit domestic transport of oil to rail, pipeline, or truck, all of which are more expensive than by water. If, however, the vessel is carrying oil from a foreign port, it does not have to comply with any of these regulations. It is important to remember that transportation commonly accounts for anywhere from 20%-80% of the total cost per unit depending on the consumer. 

3) Strategic underproduction: unlike almost every other major oil producing nation, the energy industry is not nationalized in the United States. As a result of this, private companies must lease the mineral right from either private or public land. The federal government has long been cautious to limit how much development of federal “land” they allow each year in order to ensure that America is the last nation to run out of oil. The vast majority of American oil lies offshore in federally managed waters, meaning that the government determines when and how quickly to lease out plots. All lease auctions stopped for during the first year-ish of Biden’s presidency in an effort to encourage the transition to renewables, but the Inflation a reduction Act partially resumed this process to curb rising oil costs as Russia continues to harm global economies, ensure that companies continue to invest in infrastructure so that there is still domestic expertise, and ensure that there would be enough support for the bill."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did NASA determine the appropriate angle of entry for spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere without burning up / skipping off?,"maths, mostly, backed up by wind tunnel and other scale model testing.

&#x200B;

the basic maths behind it are straightforward enough: you need an angle steep enough to prevent a ""skip"" can bouncing off the atmosphere, and shallow enough the friction of hitting the air at those speeds didn't burn them up. you can run the numbers of those two variables in a iterative fashion (ie at 6 degrees, then 6.1, 6.2 etc), and see which sets give you a ""maybe you wont die"" outcome. yes, this is a lot of maths, but you can run them in parallel and you once you have some ""known to be unworkable"" solutions, you can just skip anything beyond that (ie, if 6.3 degrees gives you a ""too steep"" result, you dont need to test 6.4 if its just going to get the same result but moreso.)

&#x200B;

also, they did extensive wind tunnel and other scale model testing to see if things worked like they thought. For a while, they were thinking in terms of an arrow shaped re-entry ship so minimise drag, but scale testing showed that a flat headed shape worked better because it created a buffer of lower temperature air between the high temp shockwave and the hull.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

once all that theoretical work was completed, they tested it in real life with a ""believed to be good"" set of parameters.

&#x200B;

also, this was all, initially, part of the ICBM design process, as they were working out how to get the nukes back down and onto target years before anyone bothered about space flight, manned or otherwise.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How can 'over-potting' be a thing when plants grow straight from the Earth's surface with infinite amounts of soil available?,"'Over-potting' isn't about 'too much soil'. It specifically refers to the relationship between a plants ability to uptake water, and the soil it's planting in, ability to dry out.

Most plants require a wet/dry cycle to properly grow. If you put a teeny-tiny plant in a big giant pot and water the pot until it's entirely saturated, the amount of soil in the pot will take longer to dry out than the plant's ability to uptake the water. Thus, the plant can literally 'drown' because in addition to water, their roots require oxygen, and they die.

Plants in the ground have this problem also....it's just that there's usually plenty of other plants competing for that water and they deal with it."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: So why can't we just harness the power from lightning?,"So instead of electricity, let's talk water.

Let's say you want to use a water barrel, like one of the old timey oak and steel ring numbers, to store some water that you'll use over the next few days.

You can fill it with a bucket faster than you use it, so it's an effective reservoir to store excess capacity. A light rain will fill it up over a few hours.


But now the high rise skyscraper next door demolishes it's Olympic swimming pool and all that water comes crashing down right on your storm barrel.

The barrel fills almost instantaneously, but there's a 1000x more water than it could ever hold. The barrel explodes from the force. Your house gets damaged, so does your yard. Everything's broken.

Fold it again, and it's 0.4 mm thick. Every fold doubles the thickness. Fold it ten times and it's just over 100 mm thick. Fold it twenty times? Now it's over 100 *metres* thick, 100,000 mm. Fold it 42 times in total? That's the same as (0.1 mm * 2^(42)), which is 440,000 km, a little more than the distance from Earth to the moon. 

It's not actually possible to do this. It's just to demonstrate how quickly numbers grow when dealing with exponential growth."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: can someone explain the phrase is “I am become death” the grammar doesn’t make any sense?,"It does make sense in old-fashioned English.

So the tense being used here is the perfect tense. It's a fairly normal way of forming the past tense in many languages. You have a subject pronoun (I), your auxilliary verb (have), and your past participle ""become"". 

In modern English we only form the perfect using one auxilliary, that being ""have"". I have eaten. I have gone. She has died. Many European languages (French, German and Italian do it, probably others too) have two different auxiliary verbs, ""have"" and ""be"". Most of the time you would use ""have"", but in some instances, you would use ""be"". The two main ones in most languages are to denote some kind of change, either in location (I am gone, I am arrived, I am come) or in state (I am died, I am grown, I am become).

English also used to have this. So whereas nowadays you would say ""I have become"", this is a change of state, so in older English you'd write ""I am become"". Same in German (Ich bin geworden) and Italian (Sono diventato/a).

This is also why in Silent Night, we have the line ""Christ the saviour is come"". Because it's an old-fashioned song using old-fashioned English. A more modern translation would say ""Christ the saviour has come""."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5. Why do military groups (101st airborne for example) seem to be numbered in random order,"It can seem random now, but at times of war new military units are created and numbered in sequence. After the war the military downsizes so it ""demobilize"" certain units and distributes their troops into other more established units. If a unit distinguishes itself through some kind of specialization or combat achievements then the leadership keeps it around as the skill and legacy can both be powerful tools. So the 101st got kept because it was a proven combat unit with airborne training. While other less experienced or less trained units were demobilized after the war and their troops distributed to other units."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how come after all these thousands of years. Female to male ratio appears to stay a consistent 50/50 ratio?,"The answer lies in evolution. Let's pretend we have a country where people have two female children for each male child. This means that each male has a better chance of breeding than each female. If due to my genetics I am likely to have more sons than average, my sons will also have those genes, and will themselves be more successful, and so on. Eventually the genes for having more sons will spread until males are equally as successful at breeding as females (roughly 50:50). The same works in reverse if females were initially more successful.

Therefore in most cases, populations balance themselves in terms of sex. Any time the balance is lost, it becomes evolutionarily advantageous for it to be restored.

This is known as ""Fisher's Principle"" if you want to read more."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why do we round UP if something is at exactly .5?,"That is one of many rounding methods, typically called ""round half up"". As you say, it means there are more numbers that round up than down, which introduces a trend into calculations that is undesirable for some applications of math. Other rounding methods aim to create different trends that are less of a problem for our applications - a particularly common one is ""[round half to even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_half_to_even)"", also called statistician's rounding or banker's rounding. In this method, 2.5 is rounded down to 2 because that's even while 3.5 is rounded up to 4 because that's even. This rounding method leaves things like averages unaffected. It still introduces a trend, but we don't often care whether our data set has more even or odd numbers."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 why rock n’ roll music in the 90s was called alternative? What was it alternative to? What defined it as a separate genre?,"Mainstream acts got played on commercial radio. They wouldn't touch 'Indie' or 'Alternative' music. Bands like REM (early on), Smiths, Pixies, Cure, Joy Division etc operated in a world outside mainstream. The music was an alternative choice.  
It's worth pointing out that radio was THE way you heard new songs - there was no file sharing, streaming, no spotify etc. Growing up at the time and listening to the bands I've mentioned - most people I was with had never ever heard of them because they weren't ever ever played on commercial radio. You had to actively seek it out. Music was tribal in a way that doesn't really exist now."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Refrigerate after opening, but not before?","Way back in the late 1800's there was a guy named Louis Pasteur. He theorized that foods spoiled by the action of tiny organisms called ""bacteria"", and that food could be prevented from spoiling if it were sealed inside a container that would prevent bacteria entering and then all the bacteria inside killed off (usually with heat). The sterile inside of the container then would not have any bacteria to spoil food and it could be preserved for long periods of time, a processed that came to be known as ""Pasteurization"". His theories and experiments disproved the previous concept of ""Spontaneous generation"" where such organisms were supposed to just spring out of materials for no reason, like maggots appearing in rotting foods essentially via magic.

The mayo in your pantry has been sterilized after it was placed inside its container and so there is no bacteria to make it spoil. However the instant you open it the container will be contaminated and you will need to refrigerate it to slow their growth."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does pushing a car that won’t start help start it?,"Usually to start a car, a little electric motor spins the engine until it has enough strength to spin by itself. This needs a lot of energy from the battery, so a dead or low battery cannot start the car.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5-What is entropy?,"Theres a handful of ways your room can be organized, but there are a ton of ways it can be messy.

So naturally your room will, over time, become messy. That‘s entropy. Nature‘s tendency for things to become messy.

The reason is actually pretty simple: if theres 1 way to be orderly and 99 ways to be messy then of course it‘s more likely to be messy.

I‘ve seen a lot of talk in the comments about energetic states so I wanna expand on that too.
- imagine an empty room with a chunk of coal on it. This room is organized; most of its energy is concentrated in a small part
- as you burn the coal you release its energy into the room. Once everything is burnt out you have a room filled with CO2. This room is messier, its energy is spread out.
- the room as a whole was never in a higher or lower energetic state. Its energy never increased or decreased. The only thing that changed is its entropy; the way the energy is distributed."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Tell me what “icing” is in hockey and truly, explain it like I’m 5","It’s easier to understand if you understand WHY it’s a rule first. 

Imagine 2 teams, red team, and blue team. Back in the day, a strategy for hockey was score a goal, and then for the rest of the game just turtle in front of your net. This led to a lot of boring 1-0 hockey games. Blue team would score a goal, and then just sit back in front of their net. When red team shot, someone would block it somehow and launch the puck back down the ice. Red team would have to go get it, skate back into Blue’s zone and repeat over and over again. 

The league decided to create an “anti-defensing” rule that said you can’t do that. If you want to dump it down the ice, you have to at least come halfway, then you can dump it. 

So that’s the rule.  You can’t just yeet the puck down the ice. You have to come to at least the red line before the dump. If it crosses the goal line (the other red line) from behind the center ice line, that’s icing. 

Some things negate icing. You’re allowed to ice the puck when your team is killing a penalty.  If an “attacking” player gets there first it’s not icing, if it hits a defender or goes through the crease it’s not icing, etc."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does stealth work?,"So imagine radar being a really big speaker making sounds so loud we can't hear it. They are loud enough that any planes nearby cause the sound to echo back to the radar and that's how they detect things.

The stealth bomber however uses special materials to absorb as much of the sound as it can so it can't echo back to the radar. It's also designed with a special shape in mind so that any sounds that aren't absorbed are echoed in directions other than the radar site. This way even if some of those sounds reach back to the radar it doesn't look like a big plane and could be mistaken for something else or at least not a threat.

Edit:just to be clear I used sound here as an analogy because it's easier for someone young to imagine as waves that bounce off surfaces. Radar projects a radio frequency. It's an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging. Sonar on the other hand does use sound.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why did speakers used to make a strange noise when a phone is about to receive a message? Also, why that doesn't happen as often now (little to no instances)?","It wasn't the speakers themselves, but rather the amplifier. First of all, back then the frequency phones used to operate at was different (900MHz) and fixed. That particular signal would interfere with the audio signal the amplifier was, well, amplifying.

Your phone is not constantly emitting a signal. That would drain the battery and keep the bandwidths busy. Instead, once it's registered with a tower, it stays put until that tower emits a signal seeking your phone. So whenever a text message would be received, your phone would ""wake up"" and confirm its presence to the network in order to receive the message. Also, the interference was also present during calls, but the text message had a specific pattern. If you held your phone next to an amplifier during a call, you'd hear a constant sound.

Nowadays, phones operate on a multitude of bandwidths. Furthermore, newer audio equipment is shielded against intereference, as older equipment was designed before mobile phones were as popular."

explainlikeimfive,eli5 why do swords not look like saws after battle,"While swords can develop nicks along the blade during prolonged combat, there’s a few things to keep in mind:

- most battlefield fighting actually utilized spears over swords, as they provided a ranged advantage
- if you were planning to engage on the battlefield with a sword, you likely also carried a shield into the battle. It was very, very rare for a soldier to only bring a sword with no defensive tool
- most sword on sword fights are very short, either because swords are very lethal or because many armored sword fights actually turned into grappling matches ending with one opponent beating the other to death or pulling out a dagger
- for a sword blade to get seriously nicked, it needs to be hit very, very hard, at a very oblique angle. At a shallow angle the blades will slide along one another (potentially leading to some of the edge shaving off but no nick), and even at the correct angle to cause damage not every strike is strong enough to deform the edge

[EDIT] To address some comments:

- my original 4th point was meant to address those rare cases where two blade edges made contact. In most cases, a blocked strike would involve the attacking blade’s edge meeting the parrying blade’s flat. Edge on edge contact did happen in some cases, like if the parrying fighter was caught off guard, but European sword treatises discouraged it where possible. 
- most strikes are not delivered at full strength, especially during UN armored combat. Usually you will probe your opponent’s defenses, and only commit to a real attack when you feel certain you have an opening (and even then it doesn’t take that much force to seriously would someone). On the defending side, it’s better to parry using the minimal force required. This is because it conserves your strength, and because it’s actually easier to control your opponent’s blade when it remains in contact with or close to yours rather than trying to fling it to the side
- *what if a sword strikes a shield?* in that case the blade edge will typically roll, since the “point” of contact is much longer, rather than chipping
- *what about eastern swords like the katana or dao?* I’m not the person to ask here, but would love to hear from people more familiar with these weapons"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do cities get buried?,"Look at your floor when you come home from a week-long vacation. You can see there is likely a layer of dust over everything. Now, you are going to sweep it away, but if you didn't the layer of dust would grow and grow.

These cities are thousands of years old, and were open to the elements more than your home is, so after years of years of dust piling up, eventually they are buried underground.

In places where there is naturally not much wind or dust, you don't get this phenomenon -- see the Nazca lines. However, in the locations you mentioned there is a lot of dust and wind so the piles of dust/sand/dirt will grow and grow and grow.  


Also, if a building collapses or some natural disaster occurs, it is often easier to add dirt to the pile and build on top, rather than clearing the debris away. This can also add layers of dirt to the city."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What were the major differences between South African apartheid and American segregation?,"Something that is important to understand in this context is that the US is about 75% white while South Africa is about 20% white. This means that enforcing white ethnic power in South Africa was going to be far more challenging. The solution that was found was that certain areas were to be declared ""black homelands"". These areas were supposed to be made independent (though South Africa never allowed them real independence) and black people were to be citizens of these ""black homelands"" and not of South Africa, leaving South Africa a white state. As such black people were not citizens of South Africa and were not legally able to live outside of these ""homelands"" (although those restrictions were more in paper than in reality).

To summarize: South Africa had a black majority while the US had a white one. As such enforcing white power in South Africa required much more extreme measures."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 How do golf courses decide what the par is for each hole?,"Basically it's based on the distance from the tee to the green, and how many shots a skilled player would need to cover that distance.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did people figure out the extraction of metal from ore/rock via mining and refining?,"It happened before written record so we don’t know exactly, but it probably happened by accident.

People discovered copper and tin working long before they developed iron working, and this is almost certainly due to the much lower melting point of those metals and their ores.

You can accidentally process copper ore by using it to build a fire pit, and then noticing later than some of your rocks have melted into a metallic puddle.

Then people learn that just copper or just tin are flimsy, but when you melt them together you get a metal that’s suitable for armor and weapons and tools - bronze.

Iron is more difficult to produce, and very early sources came from iron meteorites that were already relatively pure.  Making iron was much less of an accident, people were already familiar with bronzeworking and meteoric iron, and instead needed to develop furnaces capable of sustaining extremely high temperatures to melt down iron and its ores."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why do places like Africa have mainly big meat eating predators and places like Australia are known for small animals with extreme venom,"Africa is a big continent and the climate varies a lot depending on the region, but in general, the climate of sub-Saharan Africa is mostly tropical savannahs and tropical rainforests.

This means that there is sufficient rainfall to sustain grazing animals like gazelle and zebras, which in turn sustain larger predators like Lions.

In contrast, the interior of Australia is almost entirely desert. It's not ideal for larger predators, but it's a paradise for snakes.

More snakes means more competition between snake species, which means a greater evolutionary pressure for them to ""one-up"" each other with more and more potent venom."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What causes our brain to get “tired” and lose focus when thinking hard for extended periods of time like studying or thinking through a difficult concept?,"The build up of adenosine in your brain during your waking hours causes you to feel tired. This is called ""sleep pressure"". Adenosine is a metabolic byproduct. I don't know the finer details, but it may be related to the metabolic use of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) by your brain.

Caffeine keeps you awake because caffeine occupies but does not activate the adenosine receptors in your brain, preventing adenosine from fitting those receptors and causing you to feel sleepy. But when the caffeine wears off, all that built up adenosine can then cause a caffeine crash, where you quickly get really tired from the built up adenosine.

When you sufficient sleep, your brain clears out the extra adenosine in your blood and resets the whole thing. (For a detailed treatment of this, I recommend the book ""Why We Sleep"" by the sleep researcher Matthew Walker.)

Since adenosine builds up throughout the day due to brain activity, I speculate (and please note, this is just my educated speculation) that when you concentrate really hard on something and do a lot of brain-intensive work, the pace of production of adenosine should increase with that increase in brain activity, and that increase in adenosine concentration in your brain may give you that tired feeling."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why Man-made Diamonds do not Retain their Value,"[No diamonds retain value.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/)

If you ever try to sell a Diamond you’ll find this out. In the absolute best case you’ll get maybe 50% if you can find the right buyer. 25% is a better bet.

You will not be able to sell to a jeweler, at least not without a LOT of hunting around. If you find one they’re not even going to pay you wholesale, because they have work and verification to do that they don’t with their actual suppliers. You may be able to sell to another person who does need a ring, but you’re doing a lot of legwork there and should expect to take a huge haircut on your initial “investment”.

Almost all the value in diamonds is marketing. The marketing history is also kinda hilarious. Before lab diamonds were economically viable the marketing was, paraphrased: “The most flawless Diamond is the most perfect. Buy your lady the most perfect Diamond you can afford to show her how perfect she is” and has now moved to “A natural diamond’s unique and irreplaceable journey through the ages has imparted on it unique traits to make it different from any other. Buy your lady a unique Diamond to show her how unique and irreplaceable she is”.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how did the British royalty become “ royal”. What started this 1000 years ago?,"British royalty goes back a lot longer than 1000 years. Okay, so here comes a very brief summary of the last 2000 years of British history.

So 2000 years ago, Britannia contained lots of isolated tribes, all operating independently. Then the Romans turned up, and most of what is now England and Wales became part of the Roman Empire.

In the 4th century, the Romans left, leaving the Brits to fend for themselves, but shortly thereafter, immigrants from Northern Europe (modern day Germany and the surrounding areas) turned up and settled here, these were the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, known nowadays collectively as the ""Anglo-Saxons"", and yes, this is where the word England comes from.

Over time you get 4 major Anglo-Saxon kingdoms forming, those being Wessex, Mercia, Northumberland and East Anglia.

Around this time, the North East coast of Britain was attacked frequently by raiders from Scandanavia, known nowadays as Vikings. Because the coast tended to contain a lot of monastaries with lots of treasure, and only monks to guard it. Many vikings settled, and a lot of what is now North-Eastern England became known as the ""Danelaw"", where the Vikings ruled.

Some time around the 8th or 9th centuries, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms merged, and became the Kingdom of England. In 1066, the King of England, Edward the Confessor (not the same guy we now call King Edward I) died, and was succeeded by Harold Godwinson. However, two other people claimed the throne, those being King Harold Hardrada of Norway, and Duke William of Normandy. Both these men invaded, and while Harold defeated the Norwegians, he was killed by the Normans, and William (the Conquerer) became King William I of England. At this point, basically all of the English nobility were replaced with William's supporters from France.

In the 13th century, England conquered what we now call Wales, and made it part of England. Worth mentioning that ""Wales"" is a fairly modern invention, only existing officially fairly recently. For most of history, it was officially just part of England. But the fact the Saxons never got Wales is why the Welsh language exists. Welsh is basically the native British language before the Saxons and Vikings brought their languages to corrupt it.

In 1603, Queen Elizabeth I of England died with no apparent heirs (she's not called the Virgin Queen for nothing). So the throne went to a distant relative, King James VI of Scotland. He became King James I of England. At this point the two kingdoms were separate still, but with the same man as King. In 1649 King Charles I was executed, and we had 11 years of rule by a religious dictator before his son King Charles II was restored in 1660.

In 1689, James II was deposed and replaced by the Dutch William of Orange (who is a different William of Orange to the one famous in the Netherlands) and his wife Mary, who became joint rulers, King William III and Queen Mary II. This is the only time we've had 2 monarchs. Usually the King's wife is ""the Queen consort"" (which is what Camilla is now) and the husband of the proper Queen (like Prince Philip was to Elizabeth II) is a prince. This was done, I believe, since her claim to the throne was stronger, but they didn't want a woman in charge.

In 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed by Queen Anne, combining England (which included Wales) and Scotland into one nation.

In 1714, Queen Anne died, again with no obvious heirs. Desperate for a protestant King, they found George of Hanover, who became King George I of England. This is the main reason why people claim the British royal family are German to this day. George didn't speak English, which meant he had to delegate a lot of power, leading to the first Prime Minister as we know them today.

In 1801 the United Kingdom was created, combining Great Britain with Ireland. This would remain until 1922, when (part of) Ireland gained independence, giving the UK its modern borders."

The easiest way to calculate the probability of an event happening at least once in a given number of attempts is to first calculate the probability of the event not happening at all, and then subtract that from 1. If there is a 1 in 10 (or 0.1) chance of something happening in a year, there is a 9 in 10 (or 0.9) chance of it not happening in a given year. The probability of it not happening at all in 10 years is (0.9)\^10 = 0.3487, approximately. Therefore, the probability of it happening at least once in 10 years is 1 - 0.3487 = 0.6513 or approximately 65.13%."

Why does the doctor know that its liver cancer that spread to the lungs and not lung cancer that spread to the liver?,"For livers and lungs a doctor schedules a procedure called a “biopsy” where they take a bit of tissue out of the tumors. They send that to a specialist called a “histopathologist” that looks at the cells under the microscope and can tell what kind they, are and look for things that tell them more about the cancer.

Tumor cells will tend to look most like the cells that they originally came from, so if you see liver-looking cells from a lung tumor, you know that’s where it came from (and vice-versa).

Usually it’s pretty easy, though. The original tumor is typically pretty big compared to where it spreads to, so it’s pretty obvious even before they look at the cells

Doctors might not take biopsies from risky areas where it could harm a person taking a sample."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do we still expect ""successful failures"" on rocket launches and not just scale up or scale down the same design on successful rocket ships and launch pads to make bigger or smaller ships with more stable structural material?","If you double a rocket's height (see edit), then the area of things goes up by 2^2 = 4 and its volume goes up by 2^3 = 8. Significantly it's weight (which is a function of volume) goes up by 8, but the amount of fuel which goes through a pipe (which is a function of the cross section area of the pipe) only goes up by 4. So you'd need to increase the speed the fuel is moving, which requires a stronger pump and higher pressure in the pipe which means...

And there are countless other systems which have similar problems being scaled up. At some point you need to build the thing full size and test it.

Edit: as well as doubling the height, you do, of course, also need to double the other dimensions (radius or depth and width) which would keep it a scale model as OP was asking about.

This concept is known as the square/cube law."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Newton's Third Law of Motion,"Do that on ice, and your reasoning is on point.  Do it on pavement, with good sneakers, and you have two interactions to account for.  First, you're pushing the object forward, and it pushes back.  Second, you're pushing back on the ground (through your sneakers) and the ground is reacting to that.  Both interactions have equal-and-opposite in action."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are fridges in cold climate countries not mounted into the wall of a house so the ambient air could cool the inside?,"I have lived in houses without fridges or where the fridge was too small where we did this. The pantry is usually in the corner of the house so it gets cooler or even an outside pantry. The problem is that there is very little temperature control. In the summer temperatures can get quite high even in cold climates so the pantry would become room temperature or even higher. And in the winter you might risk frost in this pantry which destroys a lot of food. So it requires constant attention to the temperature and it might not be fully usable for large parts of the year.

Having a fridge inside is not a waste of energy in cold climates. The fridge will dump its excess heat into the room which means you do not need to heat your house as much using other means. Even the overhead from the compressor and such that gets got from use will end up as heat inside the house, which is where you want it. In fact split fridges is something you see in warmer climates, commonly industrial fridges, where you do not want to heat the inside of the house. So you can actually save energy in a warm climate by having the radiator on the back of the fridge stick outside the house. But in cold climates this would just waste energy."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: How does pinching a ribbon and sliding your finger nails along it make it curly?,"OH!OH!OH! I know this.

When you pinch the ribbon and pull on it, if the force applied exceeds what's called the 'yield' force, it causes the outside of the ribbon to deform while the inside of the ribbon stays the same. This induces the curl.

There's actually a study on this. This was the topic of a SciShow video on youtube."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did remote places in Asia and Africa not succumb to the same wave of disease and death that the Native Americans did?,"Japan might not have had contact with Europe, but they did have contact with China. China, in turn, had contact with India, which had contact with Persia, which had contact with Europe. All of Eurasia is connected, so plagues were never unique to one part of this land. The bubonic plague came from Mongolia, and cholera came from India. Japan had experienced all the same plagues as Europe, the Americas hadn't."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are there so many fintech startups when they all seem to do the exact same thing?,"Speaking as someone who works in cyber security software, you see a lot of start ups who do the same thing pop up to fill a new niche, essentially with the hope they'll get aqcuired by a major player for their technology. Im watching it happen right now. I assume the same applies to Fintech and most other software industries.

It's much easier and cheaper to get a software startup off the ground.  Very little overhead with the remote work world. All you need is a handful of engineers, a project manager or two, computers, and cloud infrastructure, and there you go. 

Not like starting other traditional businesses that need physical machines or merchandise with a high startup cost.

Also, a lot of them are just living off of investors who have the hope they either make it big or get acquired - They'll go under in two years and/or the IP will be sold off if it was half decent."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did Konami lose the source code for the original Silent Hill game? Why couldn't they just datamine the source code from the retail copies of the game?,"Source code is different than the compiled code.   

Think of it like a recipe for a cake, and a baked cake.     

Having a cake, or even eating it and being able to tell “flour, eggs, butter, vanilla, sugar” doesn’t necessarily tell you how to make the cake. You can get some info from this, but generally not an entire full recipe and steps from it. 

Source code is the exact text of the programing language that is human readable, “if hp = 0, then player = dead” (not a real language, but an easy example). 

It is then fed through a compiler that translates it to “machine speak”. 
Like mixing it then baking it in an oven so it can be eaten. 

Compiled/object code is what the computer makes sense of.   
You can reverse engineer some things from compiled if you’re really dedicated and skilled, but even then it’s not an exact match and things can get messed up. You lose variables, notes, etc which would then need to be un-borked.  
In the previous example, it would end up like “if [unknown variable] = 0 then…”  
But games have a lot of variables. Player locations, loot values, damage, HP, ranges, light values, player speed, etc. 
So now unless that’s fixed the game is broken. Which *can* be fixed, but it’s often easier to recreate the game.   

As a side note, it’s why source code leaks are a big deal for programs. For games as an example, it would describe how the game works, including things like anti-cheat."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does the first second seem longer when you suddenly look at a clock?,"This is actually super interesting, and you are correct that it is Biology. The effect is called ""chronostasis"", and it will also probably change how you think about how you experience reality!

Humans aren't that great in visual acuity but we can distinguish colors fairly well compared to other animals, and we are *amazing* at visual processing. We may not be able to see tiny details in the distance like a hawk or operate in dim light like a cat, but we can form a 3D mental model of the world like no other. There is speculation that this evolved along with the ability of humans to throw weapons at stuff. But whatever the reason there is significant brain resource devoted to processing visual stimuli from our binocular vision.

However, binocular vision requires both eyes to focus on one spot. Our eyes can follow a focused target as it moves, but they really can't smoothly sweep across our visual field. That is just too hard to process, so our eyes naturally jump from point to point. BUT, when our eyes are doing that jump (called ""saccades"") our brain just doesn't even try to understand the blurry mess of sensation that comes in. In essence you momentarily go *completely blind*!

But you don't *feel* like you went blind, right? Your vision doesn't go black or anything and it seems like you could see that whole time. The reason is because our brains fill in the lag while our eyes are moving, making it seem like instead of being blind for that time we were seeing something. What is really weird is that our brains fill it in with **what we see when they stop**! Yes, our brains go back and edit our memory of a split second ago to make it seem like we were looking at our new point of focus the whole time our eyes were moving to actually see it!

This is what is happening when you look at the clock's second hand. When you glance over to the clock your brain will tell you that you were looking at it for longer than you actually were, adding that time while your eyes were moving but you didn't actually see the clock yet. If the second hand was moving while your eyes were then your brain will think the second hand was in its new position for longer than it actually was. Based on that flawed memory it will seem like the second hand stayed there longer than a second! That is why the first second sometimes seems longer than it should when you glance over to the clock!"

If a property is empty then the owner must pay the rates. If it is occupied then the tenant pays. So the owner gets in any random, cheap to set up business at close to zero rent. The business occupies the premises for say 9 months, then folds just before the rates come due. The local authority can’t collect taxes from an extinct business and so loses out, while the owner saves themself a big tax bill."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why is it that homo erectus is usually reconstructed as a vaguely black African, while homo neanderthalensis is usually reconstructed as a white European?","Neanderthals may have been dark skinned. The assumption of light skin is due to where remains have been discovered. There is a strong correlation in human populations between skin tone and latitude.

Homo sapiens and the genus homo both originated in Africa.  Neanderthal remains have been discovered between England and Siberia. They have not been discovered in Africa.

Homo erectus remains have not been discovered in latitudes where light skin has appeared in homo sapiens.

There have been multiple out-of-Africa migrations in human history. The populations that eventually became Neanderthals appear to have migrated out of Africa and then evolved into what we classify as Neanderthal.

If  Neanderthals were light skinned it would be an example of convergent evolution where two populations independently evolve the same traits."
explainlikeimfive,eli5 What is a liminal space?,"“Liminal” means “transitional”. It’s space that you pass through without noticing like an alley or a hallway.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What has caused maternal mortality to rise so dramatically in the US since 2000?,"I did a quick bit of research on this a few years ago and found little to know actual increase, but a standardization of how to measure and report it.  Several states were tracking it differently.  Some states included deaths of pregnant mothers, some didn’t.  Some included deaths up to six months postpartum.  Some were up to 24 months.  When these metrics were normalized across several states, it looked as though it was an increase but it was the change in how it was measured."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How were kings not ""hacked"" in the olden days?","Making an exact copy of a signet ring would require expert craftsmanship - not something any random person could do.

The number of expert jewelers was relatively small, and each would be well known in their area.

A signet ring forgery would be discovered eventually, and the number of suspects would therefore be very small. Getting caught for such a crime would result in a very painful death.

Therefore, the risk/reward would be quite poor.

It almost certainly did happen quite a few times in history, especially when you're looking at thousands of years of history. But it would be sufficiently rare that the seals were ""good enough"" for their purpose."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 : Why is q always followed by u in a word?,"After Normandy France took over England in 1066, it changed the spelling of many Germanic words to look more recognizable from their Latin perspective. 

So English that were spelled with 'cw' changed to 'qu'. For example, the word 'queen' was originally spelled as 'cwen' in old English.

German keck became Old English cwic became quick.

Old Norse kvelja became Old English cwellan became quell, which is the same root as kill.

""Q"" makes a K sound because Kappa was originally the shiny new letter to replace Qoppa in ancient Greek. But Qoppa stayed around, but only to partner with the ""ew"" sound. 

Many ""qu"" words are either going to be originally k/cw words or they will be straight outta Latin. All thanks to the French influence on English. *A French dynasty* ruled England for about 300 years. 😘 The government and royal court spoke Anglo-Norman French."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 why can't limbs be transplanted to the needy just like heart, eyes etc ?","Sowing a limb into someone is difficult, but it can certainly be done. 

The issue is that just sewing a limb on doesn't mean the new owner can control the limb. That's because there are thousands of tiny nerve cells that run up and down your limbs, each connecting muscles and sensory organs to the brain. These allow the brain to both sense and control the limb.

Nerves are extremely small. So small the individual cells can only be seen under a microscope, and for a successful transplant to be done, thousands of nerves in the new limb would need to be connected to each corresponding nerve in the host, and unfortunately that's beyond our medical capability at the moment."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do washing machines always say they have one minute remaining, but it always takes so much longer to finish?","When there's one minute remaining, what the washing machine is doing is spinning to remove water 

One reason it could take longer than expected is load balancing: for the washer to spin the clothes at high speed, they need to be evenly distributed around the drum.

If they're not balanced, the resulting vibrations can be quite destructive.

So the washer will spend some time to balance the load, and how long this takes really depends on the type and quantity of clothes. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's impossible and the washer gives up without actually spin drying the clothes. Most of the time it's somewhere in between."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why can't JPEGS be transparent?,"Because the image format doesn't support it.
In order for an image to be transparent you need to encode in the image how transparent it should be. That is, for each pixel, in addition to knowing the red, green and blue values, we also need to know ""how transparent is it"". That's commonly referred to as ""alpha"", and so the image has to store RGBA (or ARGB) pixels, rather than just RGB.

JPEG doesn't do that. It only stores three color channels, red, green and blue. The image format doesn't give us a way to specify how transparent each pixel should be.

(Edit: As many commenters have pointed out, JPEG images *don't* actually store red/green/blue information -- and for that matter, it also doesn't store values for each distinct pixel. They store other information which can be used to work out red/green/blue values for each pixel)"
explainlikeimfive,eli5 Why can't we just drop rocks on landmines to make them explode?,"In WWII they had flail tanks which were basically tanks that hit the ground with big chains, hoping to set off land mines. You can also use a big roller like a steam roller. However, these are not reliable for clearing all the mines, only clearing ""a lot"" of mines. For a unit moving through a mine field, that might be enough. For kids playing or farmers farming, not so much.  


There is a charity (HeroRats) that trains rats to sniff out mines. Rats are cheaper than dogs, and they are too light to set off mines."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why are humans the only animals that need to wipe? Did hunter-gatherers walk with dirty butts?,"A greater need for that comes with upright posture, other animals don't have their exit chute buried in butt cheeks which are prone to catching and smearing feces. 

That said, we're not the ONLY ones. There are plenty of species that have intermittent issues with poop clinging to fur, skin, scales or feathers and causing problems. Ever seen a dog drag it's bottom on the ground or licking itself? Same idea happens in nature as well. 

Both of those said: diet and body hair also plays into this. We have nothing like the diet of our ancestors. Even among people today some people have relatively little trouble while others are posting that Parks and Rec meme about the marker.

Our ancestors cleaned with what was available.  Leaves, water, sand, a hand if they had to. No one likes diaper rash in any time period."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Can someone explain the Boy Girl Paradox to me?,"This problem is actually a notorious example of how it can be difficult to assign meaningful probabilities to everyday statements, at least so long as those statements leave room for some unorthodox interpretations of the information provided.

The first question gets us into the spirit. If it had asked about families where the *oldest* daughter was a girl, then the probability of a second girl would be the intuitive 1/2. This is because the information about one specific child is not informative about the other. However, we're instead told just that *one* of the children is a girl, so we have to consider all possible family formations (BB, BG, GB, and GG), restrict to the families that satisfy the condition (BG, GB, GG), and calculate the percentage that have a second girl. As other users have pointed out here, that's 1/3.

But then the second question, in a sense, takes things ""too far"". We intuitively think that the information that the girl's name is Julie is incidental to the procedure just discussed. We could have picked a family with one girl that doesn't have a daughter named Julie. However, the person discussing the paradox isn't treating it that way. For them, having a daughter named Julie is necessary to be a selected family. That requirement actually changes the set of families we could draw from because families with two girls get two chances to have a girl named Julie. The population being sampled from is thus BG(j), G(j)B, G(j)G, and GG(j) - where (j) indicates that the Girl is named Julie). Half of those families have two girls. The weekday of birth works similarly - it treats the  girl-born-on-Tuesday condition as essential to being sampled, giving families with two girls more chances to be sampled. The math is just more annoying.

Editing to address a few common misconceptions I'm seeing in the comments:

* I wrote possible families in a way where order matters because it was an easy way to keep an event space where all events have equal probability. An alternative way to do the first question would be to say there are three possibilities: {2 boys, 1 girl and 1 boy, and 2 boys}. You just have to keep in mind that the middle possibility is twice as likely as either extreme. This is because the families themselves are formed by independent draws from a 50-50 gender pool, regardless of what subset we're talking about now or later in the question. 
* Likewise, the probability of finding a family with any daughter named Julie is quite low, so the probability of e.g. GG(j) is much much lower than BB. However, because every possible family considered in that part has exactly one girl named Julie, you're just multiplying all 4 by the marginal probability that any girl is named Julie, so it cancels out in any comparisons and you don't even need to know what it is.
* There are of course many simplifying assumptions being made to keep focus on the probability puzzle here. 
   * Yes, a family could name BOTH their daughters Julie. To properly take this into account, you would have to actually know the probability that any given girl is named Julie.
   *  Sex ratios are naturally skewed just a hair towards females and sometimes unnaturally skewed towards males, so treating it like a coin flip isn't entirely accurate. 
   * (Nobody actually caught this one, but it's my favorite): Among 2-child families who have stopped having kids (who will be a subset of the families you'll draw from and hence will skew results relative to the mathematical ideal), MORE than 50% will be one boy and one girl. It's a documented phenomenon that families with two children of the same sex are more likely to have a third due to a preference for having at least one boy and at least one girl. This doesn't sway THAT many families, but it's enough to make a detectable difference."

They own big swaths of land, and have tenants (including tenant farmers) who pay them rent. They may also have other forms of wealth that generate income, like stocks or bond, but until the 20th century, most wealth was held in the form of land. Novels by Anthony Trollope tend to be more explicit than most from that era about the exact nature of characters’ wealth."

Wood actually contains a very high content of water, so it's very hard to burn it. What does burn easily though are dried out shrubs, leaves, and branches. That's why in a drought with little rain wildfire risks climb so high. It is these things that will catch fore first then spread until it's hot enough to ignite large trees."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is the difference between a Non-Comissioned Officer (NCO) and a Commissioned Officer (CO) in the military rank structure?,"In the United States military, and is common in many other militaries, there are a few different types of military members. 

The three are Enlisted, Warrant Officer, and Commissioned Officer

Your question deals with Enlisted and Commissioned Officer

Enlisted members are ""the masses"" if you will.  They can (but don't necessarily) join after high school, have little if any post-high school education, and they learn a skill or a trade via training and execute that skill.  They are foot soldiers, mechanics, medical technicians, radio operators, and a whole host of other ""technical"" specialities.  

Their rank titles start at things like Private, Seaman, Airman, and denote ""the lowest"" of all military ranks when they start. 

Commissioned officers are ""leaders"" and ""managers"" from the very beginning.  Often the baseline requirement is a 4 year college degree.  Many officers attend West Point / Navy Academy / Air Force Academy and learn military and leadership skills in a very intense military and academic environment throughout their college years.  Others do ROTC at other colleges and learn military and leadership skills throughout college.  Others finish their degree and then attend officer training.  Officers start at ranks with names like Lieutenant or Ensign, and move up to Captain in a few years (in all services but the Navy).  Although new out of college, they can be assigned to manage dozens of Soldiers / Seamen / Airmen / Marines, etc, even those with greater years in service. 

When an enlisted person has been for at least a few years (this varies by each service) they can get promoted to the ranks with names like Corporal, Sergeant or Petter Officer, and become a ""Non-Commissioned Officer"" or NCO and have more responsibility and authority over other enlisted people.  However, the NCO is always lower in rank than any officer.  The NCO may have a lot of knowledge, and expertise, and some very good leadership ability, but there is no natural rank progression from NCO to commissioned officer track. 

After several more years, the NCO can become a Senior NCO, (SNCO) or equivalent.  

Note that the Commissioned Officer has a ""commission"" from the President of the United States.  They are by default in the military until they retire or request to resign.  The enlisted person has a contract for a set number of years and then has to request to extend or get a new contract. 

The enlisted ""pay grades"" which are the levels across all the branches start at E-1, and then go all the way up to E-9.  Of these the NCO ranks are usually E-4 or E-5 up to E-6, and the SNCO  grades are E-7 through E-9.  

The officer pay grades start at O-1 and go all the way up to O-10 (which is a four star general). 

So to summarize, a person enlists right out of high school, is a ""worker bee"" or ""technician"" for a few years, then might be able to be an NCO and supervise others, and can increase in promotion to be responsible for more people.   An officer has a degree, and can be given a lot of responsibility over a lot of people right away, and can increase in rank all the way up to the general ranks.  Every officer outranks every enlisted person. 

Since I mentioned Warrant Officers at the beginning, I will briefly explain.  Warrant Officers are higher than enlisted, and they are lower than commissioned officers.  They are often former enlisted people, and they keep their technical expertise without as much of the supervisor roles. 

If I can compare it to a factory

An enlisted person is operating a machine to make a product (new enlisted person), after some years that person can be put in charge of a few people operating machines (NCO), and then eventually be a floor foreman of sorts (SNCO).  There are also machine experts there who design and overhaul the machines and keep them running in top shape (Warrant Officers).  Then there are the managers who are in charge of all of those folks, even if they have only worked there a short amount of time, but have fancy degrees in business or something.  Those are the officers. 

I hope that answers your questions."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 what “the universe is not locally real” means.,Ok the eli5 isn’t working for me.  Can we try eli3?
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do file names use underscores? What is wrong with just using a space?,"It has to do with how it's a pain to work with filenames that have spaces when writing program commands in scripting languages.

Imagine you are a computer, and someone types this command:

- RENAME carrot root

And you know that command means ""Find a file called 'carrot' and change it's filename to 'root'"".

But, what if the file had been called 'carrot A', so the user typed this:

- RENAME carrot A root

Now you, the computer, don't know what was intended, because while this *could* have meant ""Find a file called 'carrot A' and rename it to 'root', it just as easily could have meant ""Find a file called 'carrot' and rename it to 'A root'.""

The usual way for a human to get around that is to put the filename in quotes, so it's clear which way around it was meant.  i.e. you would type one of these two things:

- RENAME ""carrot a"" ""root""
- RENAME ""carrot"" ""a root"".

But people really hate having to do that all the time, so they got into the habit of typing underscores where the spaces go, so they don't have to, like this:

- RENAME carrot_a root
- RENAME carrot a_root

There's other reasons for this, besides just being lazy, and that's what if someone *ELSE* who's not you wrote that script that failed to use the quote marks, but you need to run that script as part of your normal business day?  If you made all your filenames use underscores not spaces, then your filenames would work in lazy scripts someone else wrote without quote marks in them, that you might not be able to change.

People just got in the habit of ""defensively"" using the underscores so other people's badly written code can't mess it up.

Then there's also the fact that in some very old systems, spaces were actually disallowed in filenames to make sure the above problem never arose, and then people had no choice but to put in the underscores."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5 Why are air embolisms so deadly? Like, what about an air bubble can't your body fix pretty easily?","Perfusionist here! Rule number one of my job is NO BUBBLES. The true ELI5 here is that your brain has small vessels, bubbles can get stuck in these vessels, blocking blood. No blood to the brain = bad. Your heart also has some small vessels. No blood to the heart = bad. 

Some more important detail, but not ELI5, “air” is mostly nitrogen which does not dissolve into blood as easily as CO2 or O2. Looking at solubility coefficients, nitrogen dissolves about half as well as oxygen, and CO2 about 20x better than oxygen. Bubble size also greatly impacts dissolution times since surface area and volume are not linearly related. In water, it takes 1-6 seconds for a 10 micrometer diameter bubble to dissolve. At 100 micrometers that time jumps to 100-600 seconds. The time increases even more considering a lodged bubble is more of an oblong shape than a perfect sphere. This is very patient dependent, but <15 micron diameter bubbles typically make their way through microvasculature without much issue. The boundary between gray and white matter in your brain is perfused with a lot of vessels in the 20-50 micron range, which is unfortunately right in that range of long dissolution times. 

During cardiac surgery (the field I’m most familiar with) we know bubbles get into the brain, typically in the low double digit micrometer range. If a noticeable air emboli were to be pumped up into your cerebral arteries, the turbulence in the blood can break it up into many many devastating emboli, leading to permanent tissue damage. Not something you want in your thinking blob.

This is all just brain stuff. As someone mentioned before, venous air emboli can cause lung perfusion issues (although lungs are excellent at removing gas from the venous system). A very big bolus of air could “air-lock” the heart, causing a drastic decrease in cardiac output. Air down the coronary arteries can block perfusion to the myocardium effectively causing a heart attack. This last one happens pretty often in cardiac surgery, but we’re typically still supported on cardiopulmonary bypass, it’s easily noticeable on the EKG, and the surgeon can massage air out by hand right there. 

I love talking about bubbles in medicine, so thank you for asking this question.

EDIT: It’s important to note the pulmonary and systemic circulation do not tolerate bubbles equally. If a bubble leaves the left side of your heart (beginning of systemic), the first vessels that blood flow perfuses are the coronary arteries and the head vessels. Very bad. Stoke, death, etc. as explained above. 

Small bubbles in your venous system are *unlikely* to cause any issues, but if you ask me, it’s not great practice. A venous bubble will travel back to the right chambers of your heart and get pushed into your pulmonary system. Usually they’ll dissolve away there without a problem. “50cc” seems to be the accepted limit, but not a chance in hell I would let 50ccs into my circulation (several feet worth of IV tubing). Not sure where that number comes from… 

It’s not too unusual to have an undiagnosed shunt between the right and left chambers of your heart (~1 in 6 adults have a patent foramen ovale, 1 in 3 have IPAVA shunts), meaning bubbles could potentially pass straight to the left side, ejecting to your head vessels. Funny enough, a common way to detect these opening is by injecting micro bubbles to the right side and watching an ultrasound to see if any end up on the left. Air-blood interface activates platelets, clotting, cytokine release, causes glycocalyx damage, and a bunch of stuff you generally don’t want. If you’re sitting upright, air can also travel retrograde up the SVC and work it’s way into cerebral vessels. Are you going to die from a small bubble in an IV? Probably not. There is, however, a fair bit of research suggesting it’s not a totally insignificant event, and bubble traps exist. Whenever I donate plasma and see a bubble coming back my way, I fold the line to shut off the pump and politely ask someone to clear it. I don’t knock nurses/other providers for saying it won’t hurt you, because that training is pretty standard throughout medicine, and no one is consciously ignoring problems. I don’t consider myself a lucky person (more in my profile about that), so it’s a risk I don’t care to take, and I’ll shout about this whenever I get a chance."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: Why do charged electronics (Game controllers, eReaders,) lose their charge when they're not being used?","Two things factor into this. All batteries have what's called a self discharge rate, which is where energy is lost over time because even when not being used the chemical reaction that makes power is still slowly happening. How fast this happens depends on what chemistry the battery uses.

The other (larger) factor for electronics is that even when they are ""off"" they are still running a program to watch things like power button presses. Running this program uses power and slowly drains the battery.

Edit: 3rd factor I forgot about for some battery types (li-ion and similar) they have built in battery management system electronics (BMS). These use a small amount of power and monitor the health of the battery, making sure it is not discharged too low or charged too high."

And in that contract, they agree to a fee schedule for any songs that they actually choose to air.

Then they are required to keep a record of every song they broadcast, which they report to the organization whose license they bought, along with the agreed-upon fee. That company then passes that money (minus their cut) down the chain to the individual companies (usually a record company) who own the license to that specific song. Then THAT company takes a cut, and they pay the artist(s)."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 why rabies is so deadly, why it has such a high kill rate and how/what does it actually do?","Man this is a popular question. I'll start by saying nobody knows for sure how exactly rabies kills you, but I'll start with a tl;dr

tl;dr It takes a few weeks for your immune system to eliminate rabies  but it only takes a few days to disrupt the brain enough to stop your heart and breathing. 

&#x200B;

The longer answer begins with the fact that that our brains are fragile and easily damaged. Rabies isn't the only brain virus, there are many others, yet none of them have the near 100% mortality rate of rabies in humans (dogs and bats sometimes actually fight it off however). But viral infections of your brain are still very serious, and you can even die from chicken box once it gets into the brain. So to answer the question, you first need to understand why any virus is deadly in the brain. 

1) Our brains are trapped unlike any other organ, inside a pressurized shell of bone, the skull. That means there is no room for any swelling. You can die just from a little bleeding in the brain because the pressure from the blood. When a virus attacks, the swelling can be enough to cause damage or change how the brain normally works, or it can be bad enough to cut off blood flow to parts of the brain. 

2) The immune system is somewhat restricted in the brain because of #1 above. You don't want any swelling. So it's like building a really tall wall but with no soldiers inside. That's a good defense unless someone sneaks in, then you're dead. Rabies is unique in that instead of using the blood stream which is where the wall to the brain is, they sneak in through nerves channels. like a secret door into the castle. 

3) All viruses do some damage in the beginning while your immune system ramps up. If it's a sore throat , no big deal. the cells die and get replaced. But your brain is a very finely tuned instrument. And damage or even just change to the chemistry of the brain can lead to death. Your brain doesn't have the ability to heal like other tissues. Damage may be permanent and cumulative. It takes a few weeks for your immune system to eliminate rabies  but it only takes a few days to disrupt the brain enough to stop your heart and breathing. In other words you don't have to kill brain cells to make them stop working. 

final tl;dr human brains are easily damaged by any virus, and rabies is really good at getting into your brain."

Incredibly unlikely that any two would ever lock together in the same arrangement throughout.  Incredibly unlikely that any two would have exactly the same number of molecules.  And incredibly unlikely that any two would also have the same impurities (dirt and others) distributed the same way throughout.

So it's very likely that there have never been two that are identical, even though we might be fortunate enough to find two that seem to look alike."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 What does a CEO Exactly do?,"The CEO is the highest ranking person that works at the company every day. The board of directors can fire the CEO, but the board usually meets only quarterly and its members usually have other jobs.

A CEO's day to day will depend on the size of the corporation. Generally, they are responsible for hiring and managing all of the other executives. So they might hire the head of product development, head of sales, head of marketing, general counsel, chief financial officer, and more. It's their job to attract good people into those roles, then motivate them to do a good job. All of those folks have different areas of expertise (sales, legal, accounting, engineering) so they need to listen to their expertise and then decide a plan for the company based on that.

For instance, the CFO can tell them how much money they have in the bank, and the CTO can tell them that investing an extra billion dollars in R&D can produce a product that will increase revenues by an estimated $100m/year after 3 years. The CEO needs to decide whether they can afford that, whether they believe those revenue projections, and whether the new product would be an overall positive direction for the company. When the company has a really bad year, they need to figure out what needs to change: do they need to fire and replace some of these executives, change company culture, cut some of their product line? All the decisions are ultimately either up to them, or up to people that they hire and trust to make those decisions."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5: In the days of muskets, why did armies March straight towards each others fire?","We like to think of muskets as guns. Which makes sense because they are guns and would develop into a modern military doctrine centered around guns. However, at the time of musket formations it actually makes more sense to view them as spears that occasionally shoot bits of metal very fast. If you have ever seen old timey bayonets they are very long, because being a spear was more the goal than being a gun. When you have an infantry line of musketmen, the reasons why you  would  want them in formation are the same as why  you would want a formation of spearmen. Having large numbers of guys side by side increases volume of fire. Think a volley of arrows or a volley of spears being thrown. One guy probably isn't going to hit anything, but 100 guys throwing spears in a big block probably will hit something. Muskets aren't very accurate, but a big formation of muskets firing will probably get some type of advantage.

What happens if enemies charge your position. Bayonet charges where very common, because they worked. Whats the best way to handle a bayonet charge. A nice line of spears. One guy with a spear probably isn't going to be able to handle much, but a bunch of guys with a spear that can protect each other is a much harder thing to handle. It also allows ranked fighting where the guys in the back of formation can still stab over and between the guys in the front essentially making bayonet charges very difficult without softening up the formation first, which is where the gun bit comes in.

Its also important to remember that cavalry is still very dominant at this time. Cavalry breaking through your formations could absolutely turn battles. Whats the best way to stop cavalry? A line of spears to stab the horses before they make it to the line. a group of dudes with a musket spread out will be easily flanked and torn apart piece by piece, but a formation makes that much harder. 

Finally it just makes command structures significantly easier. How do you as a general command thousands of men in battle? The answer is you dont. you break them up into formations so you only have to worry about commanding a few dozen formations instead. If order started to breakdown and formations started to get spread out, then commanders would usually lose the ability to effectively command."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is so difficult about developing nuclear weapons that makes some countries incapable of making them?,"The main problem is the nuclear fuel that powers the bomb.  Uranium is a fairly rare element on its own, but to make a bomb you need lots of a very rare isotope of uranium (U-235) that’s chemically identical but weighs ever so slightly less.

To separate out this rare isotope you need to turn it into a gas and spin it in a centrifuge.  But this is so slow you need a gigantic factory with *thousands* of centrifuges, that consume as much electrical power as a small city.

Another fuel, plutonium, is refined differently, but it also takes a massive industrial operation to make.  Either way, this is all too expensive for a small group to do, only medium and large countries can afford it.  

But the even bigger problem is that all this factory infrastructure is impossible to hide.  If you’re making nuclear bombs, you probably have enemies who want to stop you, and a giant factory full of delicate equipment is an easy target.

So to make a bomb, you need to be rich enough to build both a gigantic power-sucking factory *and* a military powerful enough to protect it from people who would like to stop you."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Where did the 5 Day Work week come from?,[deleted]
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how nuclear inspectors can inspect other countries nuclear weapon inventories and uranium refining abilities in a way that can be trusted and not just staged by the inspected country,"Due to the rarity of plutonium, initially you pretty much have to start with uranium if you wish to build a nuclear weapons program. So, let's start with uranium.

Uranium just taken out of the ground cannot be used for bombs or fuel. This uranium contains only about 0.7 percent U-235, the type of uranium that can sustain a nuclear reaction. For actual use as fuel you need something like 3 - 5%,  and for use in nuclear weapons you need something like 20%.

It is necessary to process the uranium to make the type of uranium needed for either one in large centrifuges. Such a facility is very hard to hide, so if someone wants to process uranium in this fashion they will likely have to explain the processing plant as a plant for producing nuclear fuel for reactors and allow inspection.

A single pass through a centrifuge does not do the job. You have to have the output of one centrifuge fed into another in a chain until the end product has a high enough percentage of U-235 for your purpose.

Since fuel needs a lot less refining than bomb material, the bomb material chains of centrifuges are much longer than ones used for fuel. Given the size of the centrifuges, the difficulty in moving them about and reconnecting them, and being able to cover up the fact that you did this, all in a short period of time after you are told that an inspection is coming, it is effectively impossible to hide a nuclear weapons uranium purification plant by disguising it as a nuclear fuel plant.

Similar issues occur if you try to build a breeder reactor to make plutonium. You can't just rebuild the reactor every time the inspectors show up, and so you cannot hide the fact that your reactor is producing plutonium. Since nearly the only use for even moderate amounts of plutonium is nuclear weapons, again, you are given away.

Minor edit: 20% is reported to be the minimum needed for weapons development, which I believe means used to create plutonium. It is at or just under 90% if you wish to use straight uranium. However, a straight uranium bomb is  larger and harder to deliver than a plutonium one, and as much more likely to be used in creating a weapon"
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: Why do you use ""they"" for non-gendered speech instead of ""it""?","There's a concept in linguistics called animacy, where nouns indicate whether the subject is animate, inanimate, or somewhere in between. Humans and things we anthropomorphize, like our gods, our pets, etc., are described with the highest degree of animacy the language has. Chairs, rocks, dishware, and other non-living objects are generally assigned the one of the lowest degrees of animacy. The absolute lowest degree usually goes to abstract nouns, like emotions or concepts. Plants, animals, microbes, dehumanized people groups machines, celestial objects, etc., all fall along a spectrum, in different places on the spectrum in different languages, and there are exceptions to all of this. For example, in the Navajo language, the highest tier of animacy is reserved for adult humans... and lightning. If you were raised speaking English or any other European language, that probably makes little or no sense. Just gotta shrug that one off as different strokes. 

In English, there aren't many words with a distinction of animacy. Mostly, it's just he/she, it, they, who, whom, and what. It and what have a very low degree of animacy, and should rarely, if ever, be used to refer to people. If you use ""what"" to refer to a person, it actually changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Who are you?"" asks their personal identity. ""What are you?"" asks about their physical or immutable description. The latter is also generally seen as rude. ""It,"" on the other hand, is not applicable to people at all, unless that person has explicitly asked to be referred to that way. The word implies that the subject is an inanimate object. 

The issue of ""they"" being plural is irrelevant. It's grammatically plural, but it's been used to refer to single people for over 500 years. And it's not even the only pronoun to get this treatment. ""You"" is also grammatically plural, and referred specifically to multiple people until just a few centuries ago, when ""thou,"" the singular form, fell out of common use. And like the singular they, the singular you kept its plural grammar, including conjugations. If you see or hear archaic English that uses ""thou,"" you'll also see that verbs with ""thou"" as a subject are conjugated oddly. The Bible is a great example - ""thou shalt not"" is used several times. Using the modern singular you, that would be ""you shall not,"" using the plural conjugation. It's sort of like how the Spanish usted uses plural conjugations, even though it's singular and the plural is ustedes."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why do we use serrated blades to cut things like bread and wood but regular blades for other things?,"Serrated blades add additional pressure at each point of contact. It cuts faster than a plain edge, although not as cleanly. 

Flat blades work best when you can push as you cut. Serrated blades are best used with a drag cut. 

Serrated blades work better when cutting through thick, tough, or fibrous materials. They also work better when speed is more important than precision.

Thus you might saw a tree with a serrated edge because it’s fast and works on all kinds of wood and bark. But when whittling wood you want a flat, precise blade.

Bread is obviously softer than wood, but has a tendency to crumble when cut. And if you push on it as you cut it’s liable to squish rather than cut. A fast cut with a serrated blade avoids those problems. And precision is not important."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: There are infinitely many real numbers between 0 and 1. Are there twice as many between 0 and 2, or are the two amounts equal?","To start off with, let's talk about how mathematicians count things.

Think about what you do when you count. You probably do something like looking at one object and saying ""One"", then the next and saying ""Two"", and so on. Maybe you take some short cuts and count by fives, but fundamentally what you are doing is pairing up objects with whole numbers.

The thing is, you don't even have to use whole numbers, pairing objects up with other objects also works as a way to count. In ancient times, before we had very many numbers, shepherds would count sheep using stones instead. They would keep a bag of stones next to the gate to the sheep enclosure, and in the morning as each sheep went through the gate to pasture, the shepherd would take a stone from the bag and put it in their pocket, pairing each sheep with a stone. Then, in the evening when the sheep were returning, as each one went back through the gate, the shepherd would return a stone to the bag. If all the sheep had gone through but the shepherd still had stones in his pocket, he knew there were sheep missing.

Mathematicians have a special name for this pairing up process, *bijection*, and using it is pretty important for answering questions like this, because it turns out using whole numbers doesn't always work.

Now, let's get back to your question, but we're going to rephrase it. Can we create a bijection and pair up each number between 0 and 1 to a number between 0 and 2, without any left over?

We can, it turns out. One way is to just take a number between 0 and 1 and multiply it by two, giving you a number between 0 and 2 (or do things the other way around and divide by 2). If you're a more visual person, [here's another way to do this](https://i.imgur.com/exWVWkU.mp4). The top line has a length of one and the bottom line a length of two. The vertical line touches a point on each line, pairing them up, and notice that as it sweeps from one end to the other it touches every point on both lines, meaning there aren't any unpaired numbers."

I'm sure if you actually got super precise and technical each side is a little different but not in any way that would affect anything a normal person would be doing.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 - What is Web 3.0, and why is it a big deal?","Web 3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. This is the definition according to [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)

Let's break it down:

* **Decentralization** \- this basically means they want to transition to a model of the internet where big companies aren't the main providers of online services. E.g. Google provides email, maps, search services, chat apps, etc. Along with provision of those services most of them free, they profit from monetizing your aggregated data to provide advertising. Web3 proponents imagine a reality where these services aren't controlled by one entity like Google on their servers but distributed along individual nodes instead perhaps computers like you and I are on.
* **Blockchain** \- this one is the basis of cryptocurrencies. The idea behind the blockchain is that data is written to it, it's accessible to all, is immutable (can't be changed) and permanent. The blockchain was first used to produce cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In exchange for computers performing the complex work to produce a coin, they are awarded that coin.
* **Token based economics** \- the crypto coins produced by the blockchain had no initial value besides being traded as a ""currency"" so some folks had the idea to use those tokens as currency for NFTs. Why NFTs? Because you could use regular currencies like dollars and euros for pretty much anything else in life. So instead they made something that specifically needed these new crypto coins (tokens) to purchase and sell.

**Why is this a big deal?** So far it hasn't been.

The decentralized aspect hasn't taken off except in the production of cryptocurrency which is by nature decentralized since it is a bunch of individual computers solving an equation to produce them.

The blockchain doesn't have a real purpose except to produce cryptocurrency. There just isn't much data that should be publicly accessible to all, immutable and permanent. In addition the process to write things to the blockchain is slow.

Finally token based economics is probably the most public failure. NFT's had a short surge in the initial frenzy but have since plummeted in activity. It has literally [plummeted 99%.](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/09/15/opensea-nft-trading-plummets-99/) Most people realized the pictures they were paying for had no real value except to others who thought they could sell it for more.

Edit: a lot of other explanations lumping in VR into Web 3, which is not accurate for several reasons.

VR was invented in [1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland) long before even Web 1. VR as a concept (immersive simulation) has nothing to do with decentralization, blockchain or token based economics. The Metaverse (that Meta is building) is basically a rehashing of Second Life which was built in 2003. Ironically, the Metaverse if it is built out and takes off wouldn't count as Web3 since it would be owned, managed and run by one of Web2's largest centralized entities i.e. the company formerly known as FB.

Edit2: explaining decentralization to someone else, I realized there is one semi-successful decentralized tech that has taken off which is Bittorrent. However this is far from mainstream and I'd posit that if you stopped a random person on the street and asked them what BT was, they would have no idea what you're talking about and speaks to it's limited adoption given that it was invented over 20 years ago in 2001."

It's done as fast as possible so that animals don't suffer too much, but it's still, well, a slaughter. The english word is very on point.

The actual way may depend from country to country, so I'll answer with how it is done here in France :

The animal is led to a trap, that is very tight. Someone put a gaz-pressured gun onto the animal's forehead, and when pressing the trigger a metal bar pierces a hole right in the part of the brain responsible for pain (the metal bar is a part of the ""gun"", nothing is left inside). Almost immediatly, the throat is sliced : the dying heart must pump all the blood out as fast as possible, because blood rottens meat (yeah, to many people's surprise, meat ""juice"" is actually not blood). It's beheaded, skined, cut in half by the length, and organs are removed.  Then the long halves are colded with huge fans, put in fridges, and the next day when it's cold enough we cut steaks and stuff. 

TL;DR / less gore version : the animal is put to (definitive) sleep, cut open, and peeled and emptied so that only meat and bones remain. Kinda like an orange if oranges had a skeleton, if you put it that way."

When you’re filming an episode a week, every week, for months on end, that’s a huge amount of never ending work, so having a ton of producers all working together can better divvy up the workload week to week."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why is it that when fertilizers make their way into waterways, all the oxygen disappears, killing the fish?","Oh! I can actually answer this! 

Fertilizers have a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus. When they enter a waterway, that causes algae to grow really rapidly and form “algae blooms” that cover the surface of the water. This blocks sunlight and makes it harder for plants to photosynthesize, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the water. As the plants and algae die, they’re also eaten by bacteria that require oxygen which limits the amount of oxygen in the water even further. The whole process is called eutrophication.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: When drilling like 12 km deep into the ground, how is it possible that a 12 km long pipe (drill string) is able to turn the drill bit AND be pushed down enough to drill??","The drill rig doesn't actually push the pipe down at all. In fact, a drill rig is a glorified crane. The weight of the drill string alone can be a million pounds whereas only on the order of 25,000-50,000 pounds of weight pushing the bit is needed to drill. This is accomplished by lowering the drill string and letting some of its own weight push the bit.

Rotating on the other hand is accomplished two ways. First off, the drill rig itself can spin the drill pipe. It takes on the order of 20,000 ft-lbs of torque to turn the pipe due to friction but it has the power to do it. The second method of rotation is called a mud motor. A motor can be placed at the bottom of the drill string. Mud that is pumped through the drill string spins the motor independently of the drill string.

EDIT: A few more details for the interested:

>Isn't it like trying to drill a hole with a 258 ft long piece of spaghetti?

Yes. As mentioned in the first paragraph, at no point does the drill rig push the pipe. It uses a little bit of the drill string's own weight to push the bit. The term for lowering the pipe so that it rests on some of its own weight is called ""slack-off."" As far as the rig is concerned, it is *always* suspending the drill string like a crane suspends a weight in air. If you hold a wet noodle in the air and lower it to touch your dinner plate, you are always holding the noodle up. The more noodle that you lower onto the plate, the less weight you are holding and the more weight that the noodle is pushing against the plate.

As for rotation, steel is incredible at being able to transfer torque, but at those depths it will twist around 10-15 times before the bottom of the drill string starts turning.

Others mention stabilizers, all stabilizers do is keep the pipe in the center of the hole. Keeping it concentric reduces vibration and some wobble at the bottom of the drill string.

A follow-up question could be, ""How do you control where the bit goes?"" This process is called directional drilling. The simple explanation is that you **push off the wellbore in the opposite direction that you want to steer the bit**. There are many sophisticate tools to figure out where the bit is, what direction it is pointing, and to get it to drill in a desired direction."

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: why are baseball players allowed to run past first base and not be considered “off base”?,"The reason why you’re allowed to overrun first base is because you’re already at a disadvantage trying to get from the plate to first - other runners can take a lead off (leave their base before the pitch is thrown,) but the batter can’t leave home plate until he hits the ball. If he had to slow down in order to not overrun first base, it would be much harder to hit singles… which means less offence, fewer runs scored, less exciting."

explainlikeimfive,eli5: What are the checks and balances that prevent a military coup in the USA?,"The military has a very long tradition of being politically neutral, and (as was shown in the behind-the-scenes stuff that came out about the Trump administration) actively refuse any and all orders to deploy within the United States itself against domestic parties (e.g. protestors).

Further; the US military bureaucracy is pretty massive, such that it'd be unrealistic to expect any single person (other than the POTUS) to be able to issue orders to the entirety of it. The only way to *potentially* do it would require a massive amount of popular support for a given general among both the enlisted *and* the officers (who are broadly recruited from two different economic and demographic classes of Americans).

At present, the only general that could even *hypothetically* command that level of support would be Mattis, and he ain't launching a coup. He certainly had numerous opportunities to do so from 2016-2020.

On top of *that,* you also would need buy-in from a significant portion of the governors (who have a degree of control over the various National Guard units attached to each state), as well as the intelligence community (which is spread over a number of nominally independent agencies) and the FBI. And this doesn't even touch on the civilian population, which has 350+ million weapons, and which would almost certainly be bolstered by defectors from the military who don't agree with the coup.

The *only* person who nominally has the ability to issue directives to all of that is the POTUS, and not only would the POTUS never launch a coup against themselves, but again; all of these individual facets of the US government have a track record of telling the POTUS to pound sand in the event that they issue an order broadly believed to be illegal."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are there no actual videos of any hundreds of feet high tsunamis?,"Tsunamis don’t look like a big tall wall that breaks over land. 

Waves break (fall over forming a tube of air inside a tunnel of water) when the water depth equals 1.3 times the height of the wave. 

So, a 6 foot tall wave at the beach will always break when the water depth is about 8 feet. And a 6 inch tall wave on the shore of a choppy lake will break when the water is about 8 inches deep. 

The scale is always the same. 

So a 100 foot tall rogue wave in the ocean breaks if the water depth is 130 feet. 

There are very few areas with shorelines that drop that steeply away from land, so the tall waves always break further out to sea. 

But just because a wave breaks, doesn’t mean that that water stops moving. It’s just not moving the way we picture big waves. 

That entire volume of water still hits the shore and comes onto the land, but it does it laying down instead of standing up."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why were prehistoric era animals so gigantic in comparison to animals from the ""modern era""","One huge consideration about mass extinction events: When one happens, food becomes incredibly scarce.

Predators that prey on huge herbivores run out of herbivores to feed on. 

Little critters manage to eke out a living long enough to arise the undisputed underdog champs of evolution. So multiple mass extinction events lead to adaptable, small, and low maintenance as the biggest factors in long term survival as a species.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why is it that we can structure a sentence like “I’m in school” but not “I’m in nightclub”?,"The definite article (aka the word “the”) in English is a hard one for English learners, and even among English speakers this particular question you’re asking can depend on where the English speaker you’re talking to is from. 

Generally speaking, words such as school, hospital, church, prison, university, are all institutions, where you might be referring to them in a general sense as a concept, rather than a specific place. If you’re referring to a specific place, you’d use the definite article. If you’re referring to the concept of such a place, you can omit the definite article.

“I’m in school” has the connotation that I’m enrolled in such an institution, that I’m attending one. “I’m in the school” implies a specific place, like if I’m calling you to pick me up in your car and telling you where I am. It doesn’t imply that I’m a student the same way as the first phrase does.

If you ask me where I am and I say, “I’m at church,” I’m telling you more about what I’m doing, not where I am. If I say, “I’m at the church” then it implies we both know which church I’m referring to, and I’m telling you I’m at that location. 

So that’s the simplest answer - if it’s a specific place, use the definite article. But of course there are exceptions. 

One that varies by dialect is hospital. When a British person is sick, you would tend to say “she’s in hospital” meaning she’s in the care of a hospital. In American English you would never say this, you’d always use the definite article. “She’s in the hospital” to an American implies the same thing as “she’s in hospital” would imply to a British person. The British way of saying it would sound odd to an American. The American way of saying it wouldn’t sound too odd to a British person because they’d just assume you were referring to a specific hospital.

Those are just some of the examples that I think are difficult for English learners.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do long haul truckers warm up their engine for 30 minutes before leaving?,"Cold parts behave differently than warm parts. Most things expand as they get warmer. Some things like belts and hoses are stiffer when cold and get more pliable as they warm up. 

That means if there's a problem with a part, that problem might not become apparent until it's been sufficiently warmed up. For example, a belt might be tight enough when cool but as it gets more pliable it starts to slip. Or a hose might have a tiny leak that becomes more apparent when it's warm. 

Truckers also have a lot more gauges than normal cars for things like oil pressure and several different fluid temperatures. It can take a while for those things to stabilize, and they want to see where the numbers stabilize before they get going.

That's because odds are if the engine's been off for a while they're at a truck stop or some other place where it's relatively convenient to stay put and get some maintenance done. If they YOLO and hit the road and find out in 20 minutes they're overheating, there may not be anywhere safe or convenient to stop and it will be much more difficult for them to get it fixed. 

It's also possible some of those systems just won't work well until everything's stabilized. Letting the engine idle while they get prepared for the trip helps eliminate a lot of aggravating issues, or at least helps make sure aggravating issues happen before they're more difficult to address."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does going faster than light lead to time paradoxes ????,"So...  

""The speed of light"" is not actually the speed limit of the universe. The speed limit of the universe is actually the speed of *causality*. Causality is the relationship between an event and the things that happen as a result of that event. Obviously, if you throw a baseball at a window, the window is not going to break until after you throw the ball. That's causality. It's the order of events in the universe.  

Well it turns out that the first thing we ever discovered that moves at this speed was light. At the time, it was the only thing we knew that moved at that speed, so we thought that that speed was the speed limit. It turns out that light is following the same speed limit as everything else, but it has a special property (it has no mass) that allows it to actually move at the actual speed of causality.  

For reasons we don't understand, causality has a speed limit. If something happens, the effects of that thing happening propagate out at the speed of light (causality). For example, if the sun disappeared in a magic trick, the Earth would continue to orbit the position where the sun was for 8 1/4 minutes, because the orbit of the Earth would not be affected until causality reached us. In summary, the effects of an event can never occur before the event that triggered the effects, and the fastest those effects can occur is the speed of light.  

Due to all of this, if something moves faster than light, it would be moving faster than cause-and-effect. The baseball could shatter the window before you threw the ball. And that could startle you, preventing you from ever throwing the ball in the first place. And then causality itself is broken. Time itself no longer has meaning. The burned popcorn stink fills the room before you even buy the microwave. The universe doesn't make any sense.  

With this information, now I can summarize: Time is how we measure causality. If you go faster than light, you're going faster than causality, and that means you're going faster than time. And that doesn't just send time in the wrong direction; it outright breaks it.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why do overly sweet foods make your teeth “hurt”,"Actual answer: hydrodynamic theory

Let’s say teeth have 3 layers. The inside layer is pulp, which is like the core of the tooth, containing pulp cells and nerves.

The middle layer of the tooth, surrounding the pulp, is the dentin. The dentin is made up of many tiny tubules containing finger-like projections of the pulp cells. These tubules open into little pores on the tooth surface.

When sugar meets these little tubules, osmosis causes the fluid inside to rush out, stretching the little fingerling projections of the cells, triggering a nerve response.

The outer layer of the tooth is enamel, which is kind of an insulation keeping many stimuli away from these sensitive little tubules. When enamel is damaged or absent, say from a cavity or recession respectively, it no longer present to protect those tubules and they become exposed to stimuli.

Toothpastes like Sensodyne contain potassium nitrate, which plugs up these little tubules and protects them from these outside stimuli.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 what the electric company does to restore electricity during a power outage and why it can take so long?,"If it’s because of downed lines, they gotta   locate it first, drive out there usually in debris filled roads, clear the broken tree/branches out of the way, re-string and reconnect the wires, then test to ensure that it works, all while following safety standards."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: Why are so many office blocks and retail shops in UK that are "" to let"" remain empty for months, rather than to reduce rent ? Why do landlords do this?","A pretty substantial amount of the commercial space in the UK is ""owned"" by the UK's old aristocracy, but controlled by an intermediary class of landlords whose predecessors rented that space on perpetual leases in the 1800's or early 1900's.

The intermediary landlords' perpetual leases only require them to pay rent to the actual owners if the premises is being used by someone - if the premise is vacant then they don't pay anything.  What this creates is a somewhat bizarre situation where the commercial space is being rented out by middlemen who have a minimum monthly rent they have to charge to make money - if they charge less than that minimum, they lose money.

These perpetual leases have clauses that index the rent to inflation based on whatever it was when the lease was originally entered into >100 years ago.  Any building that is currently in a downtown urban area are in areas that were fabulously wealthy back then, though many are not so wealthy now.  This results in the inflation indexed minimum rent being far too high for the current economic status of those areas, hence the space remains vacant.

Or to put it more simply, for historical reasons, most of the commercial space in the UK is currently controlled by middlemen who quite literally cannot rent the space at its market rate without losing money, but who don't have to pay anything if the space just lays vacant."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does an API work?,"APIs are used to communicate between systems (it's the middleman between systems), where the API just exposes an interface that other developers can use. Developers that call the API don't care how the API works, what it does or where/how it gets the data you want, all you care about is that you get what you wanted.

&#x200B;

Imagine a restaurant; you come in, sit at a table and a waitress comes. You tell the waitress what you want to order, then the waitress brings you your meal.

Now, you don't care how the meal was made, who cooked it, or from which ingredients, likewise you also don't care what the waitress had to do in order to get and bring you your meal. All you care is that they brought you your meal and you didn't have to do anything else other than tell the waitress what you wanted.

The waitress is the API in this case (the middleman between you and the kitchen), the kitchen is the server's backend and the customer is the developer."

When someone is counting off a song, they're typically doing it to set the speed of the song so everyone can start at the same time and at the same speed. They use 1-2-3-4 because that's typically how everyone will be counting the time in their heads as they play.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 What is Critical Thinking,"A lot of people are missing the ""critical"" part of critical thinking. In order to get closer to the truth, you need to challenge your ideas, which often requires to confront them with information or opinions that contradict them.

explainlikeimfive,"ELi5 if Einstein says gravity is not a traditional force and instead just mass bending space time, why are planets spheres?","Planets are spheres because the effects of gravity are radial. As long as you stay the same distance from a planet, its gravity stays the same strength. This makes any high points get pulled down until they're at the same potential as the rest.

Whether it be a traditional force or a bending of spacetime, the object still *moves* at the end of it. That's why calculations treating gravity as a force *usually* give really accurate results.

To be clear, a ""flat"" universe just means that the geometry you learned in high school still applies. For example, a triangle cannot have three ninety-degree corners in our universe. A (3d) spherical surface would allow you to do this while a flat one would not.

Space is not locally flat, either. Gravity makes it so that under very specific circumstances you could make a triangle with three ninety-degree corners. This is mostly unrelated to your question though. It's only on larger scales that our space is flat, like a yard with a bunch of pits in it."

The team with the ball has four plays/chances to gain ten yards. If they fail to do so, they forfeit the ball. That's basically the whole thing.

If they gain that distance enough times they eventually score a touchdown. If they are on their fourth attempt and don't believe they can make up the distance, they will ""punt"" the ball away to the other team. They lose the ball but the other team will have further to go to reach their end zone.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 How can the Southern power grid handle months of blistering heat with everyone blasting air conditioners, but can't handle two days below freezing?","In general, in extremely cold times like there, there is a much larger temperature difference between the inside and outside of a home compared to warm summer days, so more work has to be done to maintain that difference.

Heat pumps (where gas furnaces are not used as a primary heat source) also tend to be less efficient at very low temperatures. As a result, performance may be inadequate and electrical heat will be used as a backup, which is even less efficient.

At my parents home in the middle of Alabama right now, their gas furnace at nearly an 80% duty cycle can barely maintain a internal temperature in the mid 60s, and so they're also using space heaters in a bedroom for comfort."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did we determine that the sun is ~4.6 billions years old?,"Our Sun and all of the objects in its solar system were formed at roughly the same time in astronomical terms (a few hundred thousand to a few millions of years). So all of the matter is about the same age.

Moreover, the matter clumps differently at different distances from the Sun's gravitational center. Objects closest to the Sun (such Mercury, Venus, and Earth) are quite dense, while the objects farther out are much less dense (such as Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus). Even though these objects have different amounts of elements (with the heaviest elements being found in greater proportion closer to the sun), all of those elements are about the same age. 

So what is their age? In the case of elements that have a radioactive half-life, we can calculate how much decay has taken place. Isotopes of these elements have different rates of decay. For instance, carbon-14 decays quite rapidly (thousands of years) so it doesn't surprise that most of this has all decayed. Carbon-12, in constrast, is stable and it doesn't surprise us that it's all still here. How much of each isotope is left can be used to calculate how long it's been here.

One important element to look at is lead (Pb). Lead is formed when uranium decays, so the ratio of Pb-207 to Pb-206 changes because  U-235 decays to Pb-207 and U-238 decays to Pb-206. By comparing these, we can figure out how they have been hanging around, and the number comes to about 4.54 billion years.

We can check our math by comparing really old stuff like meteorites. We know how old they are by how much of each kind of lead isotope they have. The oldest ones seem to be about 4.568 billion years old if we do that. So this might be the higher possible age of the solar system and the Sun.

We can also check our math with rocks from the Moon, which hasn't had the same biological and geological action as rocks on Earth. If we calculate based on those rocks, we get an age 4.51 billion years, which is probably the lower possible age of the solar system.

That's really a pretty tight range on astronomical scales, so we can be quite confident the actual age is within that narrow range. However, we can do even better than that.

Remember we compared the proportion of isotopes U-238 to U-235 and assumed that this proportion was about the same through the solar system. However, in places where curium (which has a very short half-life) we find a little more U-235 than we expected. That's because curium also decays to U-235. This helps us be even more confident of our estimation of the age of the Sun. We sometimes want to account for the Sun being formed slightly earlier than the planets, so we add a little extra and use a age of 4.6 billion years.

Oversimplified TL;DR: We can calculate how old the Sun is quite precisely by looking at how old the different rocks are."

They are effective at cleaning, but can be somewhat chemically harsh to your skin and strip it of oils. Detergents are like synthetic versions of soap, but designed for a specific cleaning purpose, and can be engineered to be less harsh and reactive. Facial cleansers are (usually) a kind of detergent designed to be so mild that it can be used frequently on your face.

So probably your strap won't stand up to harsher chemicals like soap with regular cleaning. A facial cleanser is about as mild as it gets."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do govts raise interest rates to slow the economy instead of tax rises?,"In most Western countries interest rates are controlled by a central bank.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why are crevasse crossings, like on Everest, two ladders strapped together?","Professional Alpinist who trains with the Khumbu Ice Fall doctors here. 

The ladders you’re talking about are on the lower reaches of Everest - the khumbu Ice Fall on the south side. 

The khumbu ice fall is a deadly place, with blocks of ice the size of building regularly falling and killing people. An ice fall is basically a vertical glacier that is always moving and changing. The ladders are fixed by a team know as “The Ice Fall Doctors” - it’s a govt run team that is funded and staffed by sherpa contributed by companies all over Nepal. 

Being a glacier, the Ice fall does not come with a map. The team does not know what they will find till they get there. Some crevasses are narrow enough to comfortably walk over. Some can swallow a house whole. 

The aluminium ladders are carried up from Kathmandu to Lukla by rickety airplane. Then from lukla to EBC on a mule’s back. Then on human back up there ice fall.  There, they are anchored in fricking ice, which as you know, is not cement. 

If it were your job to fix only 1 crevasse on the ice fall - just 1 - with ladders, the catch being you are not told how wide this crevasse is, and if you fuck up, you die on the spot, what would you rather do? Would you rather start from KTM with one 50 foot ladder, or 5 x 10 foot ladders?"

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why do magic erasers work so well?,"The 'active ingredient' of magic erasers is [Melamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melamine_foam). It is a surprisingly hard material that only feels soft, and when it's a foam it has many abrasion surfaces to work with. So essentially it is a sandpaper that can get into cracks of anything that is harder than it (and it scratches off layers of anything softer than it). Once it scratches off the thing it's cleaning, it crumbles away from the sponge while surrounding it; so greasy residues are caught and contained, kind of like a pencil eraser and graphite.

Edit since this got some attention, but I think people are focusing on the wrong part: Most aggressive cleaners are abrasive in some way (they are also known as [scouring powders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouring_powder)), so melamine isn't special for that; instead, it's because it's a ""reticulated foam"" (that means ""net like""; the 'bubbles' of the foam are only made out of the lines where they intersect, while there is still lots of open space). Because of this, both the hard melamine can get into the cracks as I mentioned above (the foam is flexible, even though it's made out of hard stuff) and the mess can actually get into the foam instead of just being pushed away. Once the mess is inside the foam, the chunk of foam with it can break off and keep it from going back and being a mess. This second part is why melamine works in places that chemical cleaners or scouring powders have a tough time."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are we the only species who needs to use toilet paper?,"A big item here is our huge butts.

Having these rockin' cans means we get dirty butts that need to be cleaned after poopin'. Unlike other animals we prefer not to lick our butts clean, but we still prefer clean butts over the alternative, hence wiping. 

But for real, if you look at other animals you'll notice as a general concept that they can poop without get their skin nearly as dirty as humans can. We evolved to poop in a sort of a crutching position which naturally spreads 'em and helps with cleaning but as a society we generally use sitting positions which means dirty cheeks that need to be wiped."

Light is just one of the many things that travels at this speed. The term is the speed of causality or the fastest any information can move though space.   

As you move faster through space, you move slower through time. At the speed of light, you don't experience time at all. To something moving at light speed, it arrives at its destination instantly. You cannot move faster than instantly. It is only to the viewer that it seems to move at a slower rate of time.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why does food need to be cooled to room temperature before refrigeration?,"Food safety professional here. This is actually a very poor idea as it puts the food in the ideal conditions for spoilage for a longer time. The danger zone for food spoilage is 40-140F, so you want to hold food at those temperatures for as little time as possible. The thoughts about hot food overworking your fridge or warming other foods up to the danger zone may ha e had a grain of truth a long time ago, but nowadays it is a myth, as modern refrigerators are more than capable of sufficiently cooling whatever is put into it. 

The best practice is to take food and place it in shallow containers, then immediately place it in the fridge. This is what promotes the fastest cooling, and maintains your food in as safe a condition as possible.

Edit: fun fact showing the importance of shallow containers. The very center of a soup/stew/chili in a large stock pot can take up to 24 hours to get completely cooled down"

explainlikeimfive,eli5 how do compression stockings help your body while flying on an airplane? And is it just older people that should be wearing them?,"Your heart pumps blood through arteries, but it's more difficult to get that blood pumped back to the lungs and heart though veins, especially against gravity. Down with a push is easy, up without one is hard.

Your muscles do some of the pushing back. When you move and walk your muscles squeeze and provide some pressure to your veins. 

But when you're sitting in a seat... for hours... with your legs bent... sometimes the blood backs up, and it can clot up. (It's called thrombosis.) It's not super common but if you're older, or pregnant, have cancer, or dehydrated, the risk of it happening is higher. Thrombosis can dissolve in its own, or it can be fatal. 

Solutions are to get up an walk during the flight, flex your legs and feet, wear compression on your legs to help the 'push' back up to your lungs and heart, and stay hydrated. If you're particularly at risk, your doctor might prescribe anticoagulants. 

Compression is one thing that can help lower the risk of a blood clot in your veins."

It’s also useful for keeping elderly minds sharp. Excellent for young learning minds too, especially learning new words. For TV and social media, we might imagine what a setting smells or feels like based on what we see, but all the visuals are provided so it’s a more passive intake of information that requires less processing and concentration.

In another photo, the ball is just a motion-blurred smudge from one side of the frame to the other. This is photo B.

In photo A, we have a perfect idea of where the ball was at the exact instance that the photo was taken. But if I asked you to try and guess what direction the ball was thrown in to make that photo, you'd have no idea. It could've been thrown upward, sideways, away from you; there's no evidence to any one answer. You got 100% certainty of position, 0% certainty of velocity, and therefore energy.

In photo B, you know exactly what direction the ball was flying in, and if you knew the shutter speed of your camera and had a yardstick to measure against, then you'd know how fast it was going too. But if I asked you to point out exactly where the ball is in the photo, the best you'd be able to do is vaguely point at the ball-coloured line smeared across the whole-ass photo. 0% certainty of position, 100% certainty of energy.

So to get the best idea of the ball, we make a compromise on the shutter speed (basically the measurement accuracy) of our photo. Finally we get a photo where the ball is still a little motion-blurred, but can still clearly be identified as a ball in the photo. It's a little fuzzy, but you can at least tell it's moving. Photo C: 50% certainty of position, 50% certainty of energy.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do some muscles become sore immediately after a workout, while other muscles become sore after a couple of hours or the next morning?","Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) are just an inflammatory response to tissue use without the capabilities to remove the inflammation before it develops. Inflammation in general is actually not a positive thing (such as rolling your ankle) as it is the body's natural defense system ensuring that we don't use that tissue or joint etc anymore to prevent further ""injury"" to it. 

Strength and conditioning is training the body's various exercise systems to be better at whatever their roles are, be it hypertrophy/muscle size, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, fat loss, etc. As the training impetus continues on, the physiological systems responsible for each of these pathways improve by increasing the various enzymes or transport proteins etc needed to function efficiently and by extension the body calls for less and less ""inflammation"" (DOMS) to take place. 

DOMS are not indicative of ""a good workout"" like is commonly perceived. A new program taxing your musculature in a different way than previously experienced will invite inflammation, especially if said musculature is weak and focused during the early training days.  Think glute muscles in today's society where we spend so much time in a stretched and weakened glute state, so when these muscles are focused directly in a program you'll have more ""soreness"" early on as this tissue isn't used to being used purposefully. Compare this to a bicep workout, a muscle we use pretty regularly and purposefully in normal activities of daily living, and you'll have less DOMS as a principle after the workout. 

Most DOMS don't set it until 24-72 hours later though. As a strength coach, I don't think I've ever had myself or any clients report DOMS within the same day of a training impetus. You'll have varying degrees of *weakness* for the musculature for the following 10-12 hours after a lift, but this is just due to the tissue being exhausted during training.

The pill works by elevating your hormone levels to mimic pregnancy levels.  (this is what prevents you from ovulating.)

These hormones do a lot of the heavy lifting during fetal development, so they are not in and of themselves harmful to the fetus.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do firefighters (or investigators idk) find the cause of a fire? Isn't that super hard if everything is just ash and dust?,"Not always. First of all, fires need lots of oxygen and as they spread they suck more and more, which typically means the place a fire *starts* gets quickly surrounded by new fire which suffocates and puts out the original fire. Meaning if you go to a room that that's all burned up and you see a random spot in the corner that looks surprisingly *less burned* that's probably where the first started. 

Similarly you can often see how fire's spread, how hot they burned, but looking at the char and burn patterns. If you see areas that are overly burned, meaning they burned hotter than they should have, or paths of fire travel that don't appear to be the most obvious, that's probably due to an accelerant. For example, someone poured a stream of gasoline down a hallway to spread the fire, you'd be able to see that gasoline path in the char. 

But yeah, if you're talking about complete burning down to ash and dust, you can't tell super much. It's the middle ground fires that can tell you a story."

For the area of the country we were working in, engineering had designated a Target Neutral Temperature of 95 degrees fahrenheit , which means that if the rail was installed and anchored down at that temperature, the track structure would be able to resist both the compressive forces generated by higher temperatures and the tensile forces created by cold (shrinkage... the pool was cold damnit!)

After the new rail is installed, the rail ends will be joined, usually through a process like thermite welding:

It's not perfect, time and heavy traffic can cause the rail to ""flow"" in one direction, potentially leading to excess rail being in an area. If this is not caught and destressed by cutting out a portion of rail you could end up with a ""sun kink"" or thermal misalignment.

A flag on the moon has an angular size of ~0.002 arcseconds (an arcsecond is 1/60 of an arcminute, and an arcminute is 1/60th of a degree). In comparison, the Hubble telescope can do about 0.03 arcseconds of resolution. So even the hubble telescope cannot make out a flag on the moon."

explainlikeimfive,"eli5: If most electronic appliances' efficiency losses are through heat, does that mean that electric heaters are 100% efficient?","Pretty much. There’s negligible energy lost to other sources - sound, for example if it makes any noise, but basically 100% efficient.

In a similar vein - the old incandescent light bulbs were about 98% efficient, if you used them for heating…

This doesn’t mean electric heaters are necessarily the best way to heat a house using electricity. Provided the temperature difference to outside isn’t too much (outside isn’t much below freezing) heat pumps are much more efficient at heating a space because they use thermodynamic wizardry to *move* rather than *create* heat and can move more heat into your house than an electric heater of the same power could produce."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is it so hard to replicate the ideal conditions are plants like truffle or wasabi? Like I get they can only grow under certain conditions but what about it’s surroundings is so hard to replicate?,"I can’t speak about wasabi, but truffles are hard to grow because they actually grow from fungi that germinate alongside trees. These structures don’t form rapidly the same way you might easily be able to farm portobello or shiitake mushrooms. These fungal life cycles are extremely complex and not well understood (it’s a very niche product, and where there isn’t a massive audience to appreciate it, there isn’t a ton of money funneling in to research it), and the conditions under which truffle growth happens can vary widely from place to place, making it hard to find a one-size-fits-all solution to allow for mass production. Replicating this process on a larger scale is very expensive and time-consuming since you constantly have to generate new mycelium structures (which form mushrooms and which in turn form truffles) on new trees and let them grow up together. Truffle farming has only just started to come about in the last decade, but it’s still not done very efficiently."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: what is the difference between a generic drug to the original drug, and why do some doctors will swear by the original drug?","Most medicine doses are actually very tiny. On their own, a single dose of most medicines might look like only a few specks of dust. This creates problems if you actually try to dispense medicine in that format: it becomes too hard for people to measure out the right dose, or tell two different medicines apart. It's even too small to really swallow effectively.

To get around this problem, medicines are packaged up into larger pills. Each pill has a predetermined amount of the medicine inside it, called the active ingredient. The rest of the pill is made up of inactive ingredients: fillers to make the pill bigger, colors to make it easier to identify, coatings that make it easier to swallow, and so on. None of these inactive ingredients are medicine: only the active ingredient is. But the inactive ingredients help make it possible to take the medicine in a safe, efficient way, and so in that way, they help the medicine do its work.

The active ingredients in generic drugs must be chemically identical to the ones in name-brand drugs. However, other ingredients can be different. Doctors can specify on a prescription that the brand-name version is medically necessary, if, for example, they think the patient might be allergic to some of the inactive ingredients in a generic version of the same medicine."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why can't we use the heat from combustion to make cars more efficient?,"I mean, we *do* use heat from combustion to make cars work in the first place, but around 2/3rds of it is lost either as heat in the exhaust or heat lost through the engine block.

For a modern, liquid-cooled engine, you *could* hypothetically recover heat from the coolant, but that would either require you to replace the radiator with another heat exchanger to put the heat into something with a lower boiling point, *or* allow the engine to boil the coolant (which will almost certainly cause thermal stresses on the engine block). Then that boiled vapor can be expanded through a small turbine for power.

As for the exhaust heat; there is the potential to extract that exhaust heat, but it's somewhat tricky to do because the exhaust gas is already expanding back to ambient pressure, causing the temperature to fall (which causes you to lose efficiency on any kind of work extraction as a result of Carnot's Law). More to the point; we already use turbines to attempt it; they're called turbochargers. Alternatively, you could use variations of the same low-boiling point energy recovery (e.g. Organic Rankine Cycle tech) on the exhaust.

The other problem is actually emissions; a lot of the technology that cleans your car's exhaust is dependent on heat as an energy input to drive the process. If you extract more energy as work, you necessarily lose heat in the exhaust, which makes exhaust catalysis much more difficult, thus the car's emissions will likely get worse.

Point being; all of this requires lots of extra equipment, weight, and complexity added to the vehicle. So yeah, you can do it...but it makes absolutely no economic or thermodynamic sense."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 how ""Mushroom Grow Kits"" only say they fruit once or twice on the box, but wild/cultivated mushrooms usually don't stop.","The kit has a limited supply of resources and all of the various toxic biproducts of metabolism are building up inside the kit.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How did people throughout history sleep comfortably on surfaces like wood beds and stone slabs without experiencing severe back and neck pain, while a slight wrong position on a comfortable mattress and pillows can cause pain the next day?","What's not shown in the video are the cloth or natural materials (say, moss or animal fur) that were often added to those wooden beds to make them softer and more insulated to heat.

But, if you look at our close relatives who sleep on the ground, such as great apes, you will see a tendency to sleep on the ground, on their sides, with their arms tucked under their heads as a quasi-pillow. This position is known as ""ape sleeping"". (Google for pictures.)

Without pillows or soft mattresses: ape sleeping. But humans have the ability to craft items to help them sleep more comfortably, such as pillows or bedding and they usually do, it's just that pillows and bedding are often missing from archeological sites (because they can easily be removed or deteriorate faster) or recreations (because they require different skills to make.)"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does Pi show up in so many diverse equations if it's only related to a circle?,"The short answer is that circles are simply everywhere. And thus pi.

Earth? A giant _3D ""circle""_. Everything trigonometry? Sine, cosine and tangent are just aspects of triangles _in a circle_. Anything periodic? As sin and cos are the archetypal periodic things, lots of pi ensues. And so on and on.

So, why are circles omnipresent? Because they are the most ""perfect"" shape in 2D; similar with spheres in more dimensions:

They look the very same everywhere and from every direction. They are those points of exactly a fixed distance from the center. They optimize area/volume for a given circumference, related to why water forms little drops. They also optimize for other things, for example this is why large bodies in space are spherical.

There are so many things circles/spheres do, most of them as a result of their symmetry. And as a consequence, they are all over nature, from stars, planets, water drops, down to atoms and nucleons. If something in physics/reality does not change under rotation, such as all the laws we know, it will make spheres."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is playing dead a trend in animal behavior?

Mostly, it’s scavenger animals who will eat meat from already dead animals and they’re not too difficult to defend from.

So if you can trick a predator that you’re already dead, their instincts might say don’t risk eating it and they’ll go away. Then the animal playing dead can get away before scavengers start bothering it.

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: what is physiologically happening when my brain feels “heavy” at the end of a long, busy work day?","Your brain is composed of neurons that send little jolts of ‘electricity’ to function. I say ‘electricity’ as it’s not, but usually the differences don’t matter, in this case it does.

Your neurons send their jolts of electricity by moving charged atoms across their membrane (inside to outside or the other way). They need to take time to set up a balance of these atoms so that when they’re triggered they can rapidly respond. If you make a neuron fire repetitively it will unbalance these atoms faster than it can balance and will reach a point it can’t fire. You can see this effect easily with semantic sanitation whereby you say or read a word a lot in a short amount of time and it becomes temporarily meaningless. The neurons in charge of adding meaning to that word are unbalanced and can’t fire so you lose that function. There are things your body can do to make them able to fire more often but regardless every neuron needs some rest.

In addition to the unbalanced neurons, sleep removes a large amount of toxins that your brain naturally produces, so you build up toxins while you’re awake then clear (hopefully) them all while you sleep. The combination of unbalanced neurons and toxin build up is interpreted as a heavy sluggish feeling to discourage you from thinking as much and encourage you to start resting to fix both of these"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Arch Linux. What makes it different from the other distributions? Why is there some weird elitism paralleled by disgust around it?,"As part of a society that uses computers for nearly every facet of daily life, we typically know astonishingly little about how they operate.  Arch Linux breaks up all the fixtures of computer operation into manageable chunks to be put together (assuming it's user knows how they work) so that if anything ever goes wrong, there is a small presumption it can be repaired (for excellent ego points).

However, this is like building your own home in a way. You may be able to go on the Sears catalog (or Menards catalog for this century) and get all the parts of a house delivered, but putting it together and having a house you're proud of that seems stable and pretty to other people isn't always possible if you don't care to learn how houses work. Many people would just like a house to be built by professionals because they would rather everything work without them knowing how than try to fix a magnitude more problems that they do know (usually) how to fix.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does super glue (or any such products) don’t stick to the equipments making them?,"It's tough. 

I worked in a place that made a isocyanate glue for our products.  

We used a ton of replaceable plastic items in the production line.   Plastic buckets, replaceable hoses, etc. 

We tried to limit the availability of the reactive agent (water in the air, in our case) that the glue comes in contact with.   But eventually everything gets a coating and needs replacement. 

Other parts that were metal that could be taken out and left in a solvent bath for cleaning. 

Everyday, most of the production equipment that came in contact with the adhesive would be disassembled and cleaned or replaced.

But we don’t use calcium fluoride, a.k.a. fluorite in toothpaste because it isn’t very soluble in water.

When the warm ground released energy back out as a form of light, it's a different 'color' of light than originally hit the Earth and made it warm in the first place. The greenhouse effect is a barrier based on the 'color' of the light so it lets in the Sunlight no problem, but it becomes to a barrier to the Earthlight."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why in the USA a bunch of random people (jury) decide the fate of other people and not the actual judge?,"Because the people who founded our legal system believed that governments can become corrupt, judges may abuse their power, and that the law should be upheld by the community themselves.  So before punishing someone for breaking the law (in most cases), they get to go before a jury of their peers, and let the jury make the decision.  A jury of non-lawyers is much harder to bribe or corrupt, and since they aren't being paid by the government (besides a tiny juror fee), they don't have any duty to give the state a win in any case.

If you're being found guilty of breaking the law, it's because your neighbors examined the evidence and found it to be true, beyond reasonable doubt.  This means that the community has power over itself, rather than being at the total mercy of the government."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 how singers like Dave Grohl, Dan Reynolds, and others “scream-sing” without instantly losing their voice or coughing up a storm?","Most people think that this kind of vocal quality is achieved by tightening or constricting the vocal cords, because this is what comes naturally when screaming in anger or joy.

Even some singers who try the screaming style make this mistake and they do lose their voice and eventually damage their vocal cords permanently. 

However, singers who do this expertly utilize a different technique.

The first step is typically to produce a powerful, clean voice first. This is not unlike normal power vocals.

The second step is to introduce just enough vocal distortion by way of several techniques, depending on the kind of screaming and which range it happens on. One technique for example is to utilize a technique similar to vocal fry and integrate that to the “clean” singing. 

As one commenter has said, Melissa Cross has some videos that explain some examples of these techniques. 

At the end of the day, the technique is not to “force” sound through “constricting” the vocal cords, but to add vocal distortion to an already powerful clean vocal performance by using more relaxed vocal cord techniques that produce the distortion effect."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5, why is the acid scale going from 0-14?","> ... why isn't it something like 1-10?

Water (H2O) molecules aren't inherently unchanging and stable for all eternity, there is actually a fair amount of breaking apart (into H+ and OH-) and reforming that is constantly happening.

When scientists went through the work of discovering this they found that, if they measured the concentration of H+ ions that were loose in the pure water, that the concentration was very nearly 10^-7 M.  When they tested some Hydrochloric Acid solutions they found H+ concentrations around 10^-1 M; and when they tested some Sodium Hydroxide solutions they found H+ concentrations around 10^-13 M.

Then, when it came time to decide how to make an acid/base scale, somebody had the bright idea of *""Hey, why don't we just use the negative exponent of the H+ concentration as the scale itself?  Like a H+ concentration of 10^-7 M is pH 7, 10^-1 M is pH 1, and so on.""* and everybody else was like *""Yeah, that works.  Plus it'll really simplify conversion calculations for concentrations to pH and back again!""*."

Its also not just mass, its any energy will cause gravity, mass just happens to be the only large concentration of energy you encounter at a human scale.  Photons have gravity despite not having mass its just really really small since each photon carries so little energy.

Basically every ""Pirate Bay"" you see now is a proxy/mirror of this original system, which doesn't host anything in itself outside of a database.

The legalities around torrenting are very hard to pin on the distributor, as the ""Pirate Bay"", is only hosting the magnet string, with some basic information about it, which connects you with the others torrenting the data itself. So the website isn't doing anything illegal, and can only really be shut down with a lengthy ""lawyering"" proceedure, that the specific host of the website's credentials has to agree to.

The original makers of the pirate bay, were able to be taken a step beyond this, because they created the distribution network, and could be pinned with that, but it was still a very lengthy proceedure, and not something that can be done anywhere near as quickly as the internet can evolve.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is sleep quality so much better when exhausted?,"Sleep is when the body undoes the the processes which lead to exhaustion.  As neurotransmitters are replenished and neuro-physiological byproducts are washed away and reprocessed, neurological capacity is restored and your brain becomes ready to exert itself again, becoming more active.  

However, much of your urge to sleep (which is distinct from actual measure of exhaustion) also depends on your circadian rhythm, your body's cyclical sense of day and night.

So when you go to bed totally exhausted after a crazy active day, your physiology takes all night to recover. Your brain only becomes ready to go again just before you wake up. But this is fine because your circadian rhythm has begun to tell your renewed body ""It's time to get up, lazy bones.""

Meanwhile, when evening comes after a relatively easy day, your circadian rhythm still dutifully leads you to bed. But after only a few hours, your brain has restored iteself and becomes active again.

This activity wakes you up somewhat. But when you become a little more conscious, your circadian rhythm remains in ""stay in bed and sleep"" mode. So you toss and turn, your brain bouncing between ""I'm ready. Let's go!"" and ""Fuck off. It's 3 a.m.."""

explainlikeimfive,Eli5: What's the difference between a single phase electric current versus a 3 phased one?,"All of these smart people here are having a problem explaining this at a conceptual level:

There are two forms of power, DC and AC, and you can imagine them as a rope, and the power as friction in your hands.  DC (direct current) is like having a rope tied in a circle and constantly spinning it.  The rope goes one direction and causes friction (power) on your hands.  However, this requires all power to be looped to the power source-- not practical on a large scale.

So the power that goes to your house is AC (alternating current) , which you can think of as a single rope.  Instead of going in a loop, the rope is tugged back and forth, also creating friction (power) in your hands.

The problem with AC is that when the rope switches direction, the power being produced hits zero at some point-- sort of pulse-like.  This is not good for some types of equipment.   To mitigate this, they take 3 different ropes that are all in different ""phases"" of being pulled, so there is never a time where the power equals zero, and the power is more or less consistent.

I am a firefighter, we have had to look at EV's in detail not because they are catching fire at a greater rate, but because of the risks to fire crew on scene and the difficulty in keeping an EV extinguished.  There are special storage and space considerations for an EV once it reaches a yard for insurance inspection and eventual scrapping too.  An EV fire is toxic as hell (not that a gasoline fire is a delight either of course).  


We have to know and understand that if an EV catches fire in a rural or remote location, then it is likely that we will not have access to sufficient water for cooling/extinguishing.  We can call for 'make tankers x ' to have a shuttle system in place for deliveries of water in 6 ton loads, but at any typical motor vehicle accident you find yourself trying to manoeuvre in 14 ton tanker vehicles in a traffic jammed, restricted location and it becomes a serious hassle.  


In short, it appears that EV's are vastly less likely to catch fire, but when they do it's a pain in the arse.  It's worth noting that EV's as modern high-tech vehicles have so many safety features too (compared to 100 years of gasoline vehicles) which would help with the incidence of accidents."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: In the US, why is ‘E’ skipped in grading is schools? Students can get A, B, C,D or F but not E, why?","E is not skipped. The grading goes from A to D. 

A-D represent the passing grades. F is shorthand for Fail, aka did not pass. F is not really a grade, moreso than it is just saying you did not pass. F for fail or did not pass would mean the same. F is nice shorthand. 

Second. It avoids confusion. Grading systems varied and can be confusing. Some times E was used for Excellent in systems that started with stuff like Excellent-Good-…- ending with Fail

Omitting E works to solve both problem and confirms a grade of F means Fail."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 what is El Niño and why is it concerning?,"So the El Nino and La Nina cycle themselves are not of concern they're the normal cyclical pattern of weather for multiple countries that border the pacific ocean. Others have given a more technical explanation but the more layman one is: ""When it is El Nino, places such as Canada and northern half of USA experience warmer/drier weather, the south eastern corner becomes quite dry, countries such as Australia experience dry spells and lower rainfall while southern half of USA experience increased rainfall. When it is La Nina this almost flips, with Canada and north half of USA experiening cold weather and increased rainfall while the southern ends of NA warm and dry up. Australia and eastern Pacific regions experience increased rainfall, cooler weather""

Why it is concerning is the effects of climate change are amplifying the effects of these weather patterns. So what once might have been a once in 50 years drought is now becoming ""once in a decade"" drought and catastrophic bush-fires are becoming a almost yearly event for the dry side of the cycle, meanwhile on the wet side those ""once in 50 years flood"" is becoming a biannual occurrence.

We're coming off a particularly long La Nina period, so Canada, Australia/South Pacific and northern USA are bracing for the inevitable droughts and fires that climate change are amplifying which have plenty of fuel to burn after years of cool weather with plenty of rainfall to encourage plant growth.

Meanwhile the southern half of USA is bracing for flooding and more intensive cyclones."

What makes lemon more effective than say an orange or lime?,"Any lighty acidic hot beverage with fructose (or sucrose) would cause the same effect of reducing coughing (most regular cough ""medicine"" is 99% sugar), so if you ran out of lemon you could try with apple cider vinegar, and honey can be really substituted with any other syrup.

Lime would be ok but most orange variants are heavily engineered towards sweetness in detriment of acidity, so not as effective.

A century ago, the original treatment on Europe was hot herbs/lemon liquors (diluted in water) and sweet wines, which also comes with a few extra ""side effects""."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: how can sommeliers spot nuts, tobacco, berries, chocolate and similar in wine when it’s only made from, you know, grapes?","Somehow, I don't see anyone else saying it. Yeast and aging.

Yes taste is subjective and in some industries like wine, often BS.

However, the chemical complexity yeast and barrel aging can impart are totally real. 

How? Yeast are single celled fungi that eat sugar and shit out alcohol. However, they also fart C02 and other trace chemicals. These trace chemicals can be the same or have similar smell/taste to chemicals found in all the silly tasting notes mentioned on the label. Don't believe me? Read up on Belgian beer yeasts. Belgian beer is designed to be very yeast forward, and many many flavor profiles can be made out of simply water, grains, yeast and hops. 

Same goes for barrel aging. Oak or whatever kinds of trees soak up chemicals from the air and soil, concentrate them, then leach them out during barrell aging (if your wine in this case is aged). It's not fundamentally different than why BBQ might be advertised as being hickory or cherry smoked. The wood contains complex flavors. 

Not too mention that for some very specific grapes, yes, even the soil composition can cause specific traits in the grape juice as well. Much like oak or cherry trees soak up and create a chemical profile in the wood, grapes will have a different flavor profile based on where they grew. 

Does all this sound like bs? Most mass produced food will not contain fruit from one single field, like some high end wines will. Your loaf of bread is made from many fields of wheat to balance out the flavor and make it more predictable, at the loss of what might be a very unique flavor profile from individual fields."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how fast is the universe expanding,"The universe appears to be expanding at a uniform rate everywhere. The rate at which it expands depends on the distance you're measuring.

If you have galaxies evenly spaced like this

A-B-C-D-E  

and after a million years they're like this

A--B--C--D--E

then you can see that C is now one dash farther from B, but *two* dashes farther from A. And A is four dashes farther from E. All in the same amount of time.

This is why we observe that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. The galaxies themselves aren't moving, it's space itself that is expanding, and carrying the galaxies apart. So the more space is between them, the more space is expanding, so the faster they are receding. Add up all that cumulative space, and you can see that very distant galaxies are moving apart faster than the speed of light."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why hasn’t the audio quality of “on hold” music improved in decades?,"a) it doesn't have to and b) it's actually gotten worse.

TomScott has a pretty good video about it.  What it boils down to is that there's only so much room on a wire for signals but there's lots of ways of compressing a signal so it takes up less space.  Different methods of compression have different tradeoffs.

One of the tradeoffs they use for telephone signals is they can compress it a *lot* but the compression makes things outside of normal speaking ranges sound terrible.

And then that signal reaches a company where it goes into their internal telephone system, which uses another compression.  And that might go into a third, fourth, or more different system to end up at the call center, all with their own compressions.  Some are better than others, but stacking them on top of each other cannot end well.

And on top of that splitting an amplifying an analog signal is pretty straight forward.  Give it more power, connect multiple wires together, and you've got an amplified and split signal.  But a digital signal?  You need processing power for each one, so whatever bottom shelf cheapest possible system they have serving up the hold music has to simultaneously handle all the conversations that are being held as well as play hold music - which mind you is being compressed to hell and back in a way that's not good for music - for everyone, all at the same time.

So between terrible compression and minimum possible hardware, you end up with truly atrocious sound quality."

To simulate an aircraft’s flight mechanics, pulling down on the joystick caused your plane to point upwards and go higher or gain altitude.

When FPS games came along, you again had access to left and right, and up and down movement. The camera functioned in much the same way the “plane” did. Therefore, all of us that learned “down is up” on flight sims brought that same muscle memory to FPS’s, and the inverted y-axis option was born."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: When/why did vocals-guitar-bass-drums become the vast majority of rock music group makeups? Even with the occasional keyboardist, bands are almost entirely the same instruments.","The holy trinity of any popular music (at least before full-on digital production) is:

1. Something to keep time (drums of some kind)
2. Something to lay the musical foundation (bass)
3. Something to play the melody (guitar, keys, vocals, horn, etc.)

With more people, you often dedicate one of the instruments that can play multiple notes at once (guitar, piano) to outlining the chords that underlie the music. 

Rock music developed when the most exciting new percussion instrument was a drumkit, and the most exciting new tonal instruments were electric basses and guitars.

Think of the skin as being the largest organ in your body. Damage to the largest organ will inevitably have an impact on other organs. The first organs that start to go are the kidneys. Think of how your skin retains moisture in your body. It keeps the water in your blood. Your blood becomes thicker now without as much water in it. Your kidneys filters your blood. Your heart pumps your blood.  Now you have nothing to keep that water in . Your thickened blood is more susceptible to clot. Cause a stroke or a clot in your lung. We try to keep blood flowing to all our organs to deliver oxygen to them. We divert this blood to the most important areas- our brain, our heart.  Everything works harder in your body. Your lungs work harder to put oxygen in the blood. Your gut doesn’t get enough blood flow, and not enough oxygen. The tissue starts to die. It starts to breakdown with your stool in it and spread infection inside your body.  And of course the obvious answer that’s mentioned above is the large amount of open skin is highly susceptible to infection."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do organ recipients need to be a match but have to take anti rejection meds for the rest of their lives?,"""A match"" is a matter of degree, and ""rejection"" is a matter of degree. No organ transplant will ever really be a perfect match, your body will always recognize foreign DNA. But some are a closer match than others. If it's not a close match at all it will be instantly rejected, if it's a close match, it'll take many years before it's fully rejected. The anti-rejection meds slow down the process of rejection, but they can't cancel the basic biology of it all. The drugs won't work at all on a bad match, and even with a good match, they won't work forever. It's considered lucky if you get 20 years out of a kidney transplant before it finally fails and you need another transplant. They usually fail within 10 years."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How come dinosaurs like the titanosaur grow to such large size, when animals like the elephant cant grow larger due to the square cube law?","The square cube law doesn't mean you can't have bigger things, it just means you can't scale up an existing thing indefinitely and expect it to work.

The bigger animals, like the dinosaurs you're thinking of, simply had differently structured bodies that allowed them to be bigger (more bone to body ratio, hollow bones...). 

It's not like an elephant is the upper limit for mammal size. If you took a mouse and made it as big as an elephant, it would also collapse. If you took a small dinosaur, and made it bigger it would also (probably) not work.

The square-cube law isn't specific to biology, it's just an observation about how volume grows faster (cubically) than surface (squarly), which also (usually) means that mass will grow faster than the support structure for that mass. An elephants weight is supported by its bones, muscles etc. If you scaled it up the bones would get bigger too, but the mass of the bones would get bigger faster, and at some point, it would get too much. If you wanted a bigger elephant, you'd need to change how much bone it has compared to It's body size (not just how much bone it has compared to a smaller elephant). The reason real elephants can't get any bigger is that when a new one is born, evolution doesn't go on a character select screen and pick what kind of bone-to-mass ratio it would want. It's stuck with what it has, at least for now.

Edit: Just to address this, because people keep posting bits and pieces of it in the replies: yes, the square-cube law has many more biological implications than just collapsing under your own weight because your bones and what not were not prepared to handle it. That's just the most common thing you hear when people talk about it in popularization, because it's kinda fun, in a morbid way. 

One other thing that becomes a problem, and you can see this very well with elephants specifically, is that as you grow, you become to have cooling problems, since you gradually have less and less skin to disipate the heat, proportional to how much you're producing. That's why elephants have such huge ears. But there's many other implications, such as not being able to absorb enough oxygen, because your lungs are too small, not being able process nutrients fast enough, because you don't have enough gut surface... Really anything that has anything to do with the surface or cross section of an organ will become problematic if you scale an animal up or down."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5… when a massive cloud of dust finally coalesces into a star, is there one magic moment when it “ignites“, like a lightbulb? Or, does it just start to faintly glow in the middle, and get brighter over a long time?","I assume by ignite you mean that the energy from fusion starts being emitted from the star, but far before that happens the proto-star will already be very, *very* hot and bright. This is because as all the dust collapses, it is all hitting each other and all that kinetic energy (which was previously gravitational potential energy) is ending up as thermal energy. This is what we call the virial theorem.

Before we understood how stars worked, many people thought that this was where all the energy of stars came from, what we call the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why do you start laughing when you hear or see something funny?,"My understanding is that the best hypothesis among neuroscientists right now is that laughter is an extension of an early primate's ""all clear"" signal. The idea is that you see or hear something that seems like it might indicate danger, but then you identify the source as something that is actually silly and innocuous. You make a noise, both to release the tension of the situation and to indicate to your fellow primates that there is no actual danger here. In other words, ""Ha ha! For a second I thought that vine was a snake.""

Most jokes in some way hinge upon this mechanic. The setup builds up some kind of tension, and then the punchline reveals the source of the tension to actually be something silly rather than serious.

It's also theorized that this may have something to do with the reason why we laugh when we're tickled. Tickling is the rough equivalent of the ""play-fighting"" instinct in cats and dogs--someone reaches out and grabs you in a manner that seems threatening, and weak spots (like your armpits, neck, and belly) are the ones that elicit the strongest response. The person being tickled laughs, as a way of indicating to onlookers ""Don't worry, this is not actually a threatening situation! We're just playing!"""

explainlikeimfive,"Eli5, why is the average life expectancy for men lower than women?","Many of these answers cover the societal reason why this is the case.  Yet there is also a biological component - even in wild animals, averaged across all species females live on average about 18% longer than males.  As the sex capable of reproduction, it makes sense that evolution would favour their survival, but by what mechanism?

The biggest reason, in humans at least, is hormonal.  Estrogen breaks down cholesterol, and changes where the body prefers to store fat.  Women tend to build fat under the skin, distributed broadly across the body, this is [subcutaneous fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue#Subcutaneous_fat) and is relatively benign.

Men on the other hand form excess fat stores in the trunk, around the organs.  This is called [visceral fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue#Visceral_fat) and leads to so-called 'beer bellies' or 'apple-shaped bodies'.  Visceral fat greatly [increases risk of heart failure](https://www.nature.com/articles/hr200732.pdf) and leads to the biggest difference in longevity between sexes."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is e (2.718…) and why does it literally appear everywhere?,"It's a number that comes up when how fast something changes depends on how much of it there already is.

That sounds confusing, but it's really easy to understand with some examples.

A bunch of rabbits live in the meadow. They do the rabbit thing, and soon enough there are more rabbits.

Now that there are more rabbits, that means more pairs of rabbit parents, which means they reproduce even faster! Which makes more rabbits, which leads to faster reproduction, which makes more rabbits... etc.

As you see, how fast the rabbits reproduce depends on how many rabbits there are. And when they reproduce, it creates more rabbits, which continues the loop! (obviously, for simplicity, I'm not including all the rabbits who die or get eaten or the time it takes them to grow up)

The other common example is interest. You gain interest based on how much money you have. And once you gain interest, now you have more money! So you gain more interest, which gives you more money, which gives you more interest... etc.

It appears in nature, e.g. in the patterns of certain plants, because how fast the plant is able to grow depends on how big it is already. Lots of things in nature, as well as in human society, have this kind of relationship.

Basically, when you write out the equations representing this relationship, e is the number that comes out as the most basic number that, when you put it in the equation, causes the equation to grow at the same rate as its current size. Everything else is just multiplying this basic equation by some other numbers to change the exact rate and amount.

explainlikeimfive,Eli5 Where does the dirt come from?,"On land, you can easily see dirt forming around you. It's the natural remnants of a crumbling world: trees decay, drop leaves, animals poop, living things die, rocks erode and turn to dust ...all this matter becomes dirt. Now imagine a new volcanic rocky outcrop emerging from the ocean. It's barren. But over time, life happens: seabirds poop on it. Lichen spores blow in on the breeze, settle down, begin growing on the rock, and eating into it. They emit acid which helps break down the rock a litttle, but also hold onto dust in the air, and trap it, accumulating it. Rainfall and wind helps grind down the rock. In just a few years, a barren rocky island in the middle of the ocean begins to form dirt on top, and soon offers a home to seaborne seeds which happenstance washes ashore, to become the pioneers of a future forest."
explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why does 'its' not have a possesive apostrophe?,"It did in the past, but that fell out of usage for two reasons - first of all, you don't want to confuse it with the contraction it + is, which continues to get the apostrophe. Secondly, grammarians noted that *its* is used as the possessive pronoun for ungender third person alongside *his*, *her*, *my*, etc. which never get apostrophes because they are pronouns. For example *hers* also does not have an apostrophe for the same reason, it's a pronoun, not a contraction."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how does fantasy football work? And why are so many US men obsessed with it?,"Fantasy sports, including baseball, basketball, American football, Soccer/football, etc. basically all work on the same principle. Before each season participants join leagues, say a group of 8 friends might form a league.  The people in a given league participate in a draft where they take turns picking different players to fill out an imaginary team.  Usually there are requirements or limits on how many players of each position they can choose. 

Then during the season before each game the fantasy participants set their lineup. Participants are matched up with different opponents each week.  The participants gain points based on the real performance of the sports players, not just points scored but other criteria such as yards gained, tackles made, etc.  The participant whose “team” scores the most points is the winner.  

Why do people do it?  For fun, for money, to make games where the team they don’t usually root for more interesting, etc.  There’s lots of reasons and it’s different for each person. It’s no different than any other hobby in that sense."

Tl:dr the tire pushes a bit of dirt into a mound before driving over it. They grow as the process repeats."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How are average-sized and above-average-sized people sometimes able to develop huge tolerances to alcohol and not immediately die?,"There are basically two mechanisms of alcohol tolerance. The first is that your body (specifically your liver) gets better at clearing alcohol from the bloodstream. This means that if you drink the same amount, it doesn't raise your blood alcohol content (BAC) as much. The second mechanism is that the places where alcohol has an effect in the body become less sensitive to it. Your body ""recalibrates"", as it were, to the presence of alcohol. This means that, even if you have the same BAC as someone else, you won't feel the effects as much. The flipside of this is that you won't feel good if you have a BAC of 0. Because your body (and esp. your brain) has recalibrated to having alcohol around all the time, having no alcohol means you don't function well. 

People who drink a lot of alcohol will ""train"" both of these mechanisms. So an alcoholic who chugs a fifth of scotch will (A) not raise their BAC as much as a healthy person and (B) not feel the effects of the BAC they run up as much as a healthy person would. 

The ""breakdown tolerance"" mechanism can eventually fail as people rack up so much liver damage that their liver just gives out. 

The ""systemic tolerance"" (I'm making these terms up btw) mechanism is very important to be aware of when trying to get rid of alcohol addiction, because it get can to the point where an alcoholic **needs** to consume some amount of alcohol, or they might actually develop seizures and even die. Their brain chemistry is so adapted to constantly having alcohol, that without it the chemical balance gets totally screwed up. People with severe alcohol addiction therefore need to be weaned off alcohol gradually, and not quit drinking all at once. This is best done under expert medical supervision, of course."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: upon its discovery in the 20th century, why did AIDS spread so rapidly in Africa compared to the rest of the world?","AIDS is the medical condition resulting from prolonged infection with HIV, 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus.'  

To understand why AIDS spread rapidly, it's helpful to know two things. 

Firstly, HIV is prevalent amongst apes, and it is thought to have crossed the species barrier when people in rural African communities consumed contaminated bushmeat (not necessarily through direct consumption, more like infected blood contaminating the minor scrapes and scratches on hunter's skin.) 

Second, once infected with HIV, there is a long latency period before you begin showing symptoms of AIDS.

Both of these factors meant that it took years for anyone to comprehend that we were facing a new (for humans) disease. The HIV virus jumped the species barrier, and infected individuals would be asymptomatic for a long time - passing the virus along without any knowledge whatsoever. 

When HIV develops into full blown AIDs, it means your body is more vulnerable to run of the mill, everyday diseases. You die from catching a cold, and not being able to fight it off because your immune system is shot and it develops into advanced, lethal pneumonia. 

In Africa, there is less medical care readily available, and so there is already a higher mortality rate than in many developed countries. Especially for babies, and babies born HIV positive would likely pass away in their first couple of years. Ultimately, the increasing mortality rate brought on by the increasing prevalence of AIDS was not immediately clear or obvious. People often put illness and sickness down to God's will. 

It was only when young healthy men in New York began dying of (usually) rare cancers and complications, that doctors began realising their immune systems were shot, and traced the emergence of HIV to Africa. 

Now, there was a great deal of fear regarding AIDS. In the US, it was primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual contact (and therefore the gay community got hit hard.) But in Africa, the lack of access to condoms meant all people were exposed to more unprotected sex, and so HIV spread exponentially. And because HIV is also transmitted vertically, babies were being born HIV positive - and as birth rates are typically higher in Africa, this meant AIDS proliferated quickly. 

As time went on, there was a systematic lack of education and a lot of fear regarding AIDS which led to desperation. Some infected people thought that by sleeping with virgins, they could transfer the virus away from themselves - which led to a great deal of sexual assault, especially of minors. Whilst this happened worldwide, it was more prevalent in poor, relatively unpoliced regions of the world. 

Once HIV was identified and appropriate medications developed to halt the spread, they were made accessible to people in the developed world. The complex nature of HIV means you need to take a rotating assortment of 3-6 kinds of anti-viral drugs to suppress development, and they must be stored in the right conditions to be effective - there just isn't the infrastructure to facilitate such medical regimes in all parts of Africa, especially considering the medicine must be taken daily."

explainlikeimfive,eli5 Why can't black boxes in Aeroplanes update data to a cloud throughout a flight or after a crash has occured? why do we need to find the physical box?,"Black boxes are fairly basic devices. They record everything with the intent of it being preserved through a crash. A lot of aircraft data is recorded and broadcast, such as ADS-B data, but streaming the cockpit voice recorder as well as flight data requires a lot of additional technology that costs more money and requires more equipment that needs to be made robustly (to avoid dying in a crash). That said, companies like Inmarsat are trying to create a black box in the cloud.

There basically needs to be upgrades to the aircraft, as well as ground supports/satellites to manage this information. For the ICAO to consider this as good enough, not only does it need to be as strong as a black box type recorder but also have the reliability that we just don't currently have infrastructure for, nor the real desire from an aviation money side to implement."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: During the medieval times, alcohol was commonly drank instead of water, as it had less chances to carry diseases like cholera. However, the portraits of people at the time don’t show FAS symptoms. Why?","The typical table beer or ""small beer"" was less than 1% alcohol by volume.

Stronger beers were produced as well but it wasn't like everyone was getting smashed all the time."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Does a volcano have a 'floor' under the lava? or does it go straight to the centre of the earth?,"The entire crust, including the volcano, sort of “floats” on the Mantle.

The Mantle isn’t quite liquid, but it’s not quite solid either.  It’s highly viscous molten rock under considerable pressure.  It “flows” over very long time scales but you couldn’t swim in it.

Think of it like *really* thick tar.  You could walk on it, but it’s not solid."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why did it used to be harder to sail over deep ocean, compared to shallow waters","It is more to do with being far from land. Land does a few things for a sailor. First, it is a convenient reference point; if you keep the shore to starboard, you know where you are and are going. Second, land tends to decrease the power of weather; trees, mountains, etc. dissapate the wind, and don't let it build up as much. Third, being close to land made it so you did not have to keep as many provisions; you could usually go to land to forage or trade for food and water.

One area where the depth of the water mattered was in the size of waves. In shallow water, if a wave gets big enough it starts to rub against the bottom, and starts to die out. In deep water the waves can get much bigger. Also, waves are usually driven by wind, and again, land breaks up the wind."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why did a heart shape, which looks nothing like a physical heart, become the undisputed symbol for a heart?","The truth is, the simple and boring answer is correct.  The heart shape represents a heart because it _does_ look like a physical heart.  I ran anatomy and physiology labs for years, and I've dissected more sheep hearts than I care to think about, so I know what I'm talking about from personal experience.  

The heart symbol looks about as much like a real heart as a smiley face symbol looks like a human face; it's a simplified representation of features.  When you look at an actual heart that has been cut out of a sheep or cow or whatever in real life, what you see is the two atria at the top, then the heart coming to a point at the bottom.  People were quite familiar with animal hearts because they butchered livestock.  

Why don't we in the modern world think heart shapes look like hearts?  Well, it's because most people in the modern world have much less contact with the process of butchery, and much more contact with diagrams of heart anatomy.  Our diagrams show a bunch of veins and arteries connected to the heart, but those are cut off when removing it from the body.  Our diagrams show two ventricles at the bottom of the heart, but these are not very visibly distinct on a real heart.  It's not so much that the heart symbol doesn't look like a real, physical heart...rather, it doesn't look like our _diagrams_ of a real heart.  

Now, for a bit of a history lesson:  the heart shape goes back thousands of years, but for most of that time it has just been another shape...often associated with plant leaves, which often have a similar shape.  This is where the idea that it's related to silphium comes from.  But the association of physical hearts and heart symbols goes back only to the late middle ages, and starts with anatomical depictions in medical illustrations before coming to symbolize love as well due to the late Medieval/Renaissance association of the heart with love.  There's no real evidence that this modern use of the symbol had anything to do with the long-extinct silphium plant."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do movie studios know that cinemas are paying them correctly?,There is a 3rd party company named Rentrak (that was recently bought by comScore) that collects the numbers and submits them to  the studios.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: why can't you float in water forever?,"There's several reasons: 

Any water that is not at least as warm your own body temperature will over time cool you down so you'll experience hypothermia.

 At the same time, you'll start cramping up and also getting tired. 
Because it's just a little harder to breathe when your chest isn't at surface level, you'll usually kick your feet every now and then to come up a little to make it easier to breathe which contributes to you getting tired. 

Also, when you're in the ocean, the waves are a factor because they can easily prevent you from breathing properly. The animals of the ocean are another topic altogether. 

One more  problem is that people who realise that they're having a problem in open water don't usually stay calm and collected but panic, use up their energy and try to fight the water. 

Last but not least it's hard to keep your head in a position that makes breathing easy enough for hours or even days on end. 

So although it's quite possible to float for a LONG time given the right circumstances, it's not that easy."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How is Costa Rica so stable?,"On a map, Central America appears to be a small area with several geographically close countries.  However, those countries are surrounded by dense jungle that was, until recently, inaccessible to people.  

So even though Costa Rica looks like it shares a land border with Nicaragua and Panama, the truth is that the jungle on those borders is actually more of a barrier than the ocean is, so Costa Rica is almost like a geographic super island.  Because of how difficult it has historically been to move between countries in that region, issues in one country tend to stay isolated within that country, rather than spreading throughout the region.

As to why Costa Rica is generally more stable?  One of the longstanding issues in Latin America is the existence of a distinct, Spanish ethnic group of aristocratic landowners.  That aristocratic class typically has economic and political dominion over countries that are composed mainly of poor, mixed race mestizos.  The instability in Latin American countries is largely due to the ethnic and economic conflict between those two distinct ethnic/social classes.

Costa Rica's ethnic makeup doesn't look like other Latin American countries.  There was virtually no indigenous population in Costa Rica when the Spanish got there and the indigenous population that did exist all lived in inaccessible highlands.  Whereas in other Latin American countries, the large indigenous population was more or less interbred and enslaved to become the countries' peasant class, in Costa Rica the tiny indigenous population spent most of the country's history isolated in small bubbles in the interior of the country.

One of the effects of this is that Costa Rican society never stratified into a Spanish race aristocratic class and mixed race peasant class like other Latin American countries.  Instead, Costa Rica formed into an ethnically homogeneous society of economically equal, small holding farmers.  The fact that there were no large, distinct ethnic or economic groups to compete for power has kept the country stable.

IE, most Latin American countries are socially similar to countries in Africa, where you have one, distinct ethnic group that holds all of the wealth and political power lording over one or more extremely poor ethnic groups.  Costa Rica, on the other hand, is socially similar to a country like Australia."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did HIV spread from non-human primates to humans?,"Almost certainly it was transmission from someone butchering a primate. This actually happened twice, since there are two different strains of HIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is from chimps, and HIV-2 is from a monkey called a Sooty Mangabey. 

There's evidence that this occurred quite a long time ago, it appears to have been circulating in the 1920s in Kinshasa (called Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo at that point). So it was likely circulating in smaller populations earlier than that."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why do chickens get hypnotized by drawing a straight line?,"The scientific name for this is tonic immobility and is something some animals do if they think they are about to die, as a last ditch effort to avoid danger. Possums famously do this when they get scared. 

One theory about the line method in particular is that  the chicken thinks it sees a snake, though this isn't proven. And there are other methods of getting a chicken to enter a ""hypnotized state"" including tucking its head under its wing as though it's sleeping"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: how were Oppenheimer and Groves able to stand at ground zero right after the first atom bomb exploded without getting radiation poisoning?,"Trinity created radiation hazards similar to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - most of the danger was concentrated in the first few hours.  The difference is that civilian victims had *no idea* what they had been subjected to, how or where to hide from fallout, for how long, etc.

In contrast, Los Alamos scientists didn't *immediately* drive into ground zero.  They sent crews in lead-lined Sherman tanks to do an initial survey, wore dosimeters, etc.  Some of those tankers did receive significant doses, over ten rads, but those were several times too small to cause ARS.

Dose limits weren't understood at the time.  The project had a few criticality accidents, two of them fatal, and had seen ARS but they didn't have enough data to predict what a lethal short-term dose would be.  That data would come from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Oppenheimer died of cancer, but we know enough now to say it was far more likely the result of smoking than his atomic career.  

Trinity did cause harm to civilians.  We know that roughly a hundred cattle were burned by fallout; the government purchased 88 of them as compensation - and people lived and worked in the same places.  The fallout from that test was never properly mapped and victims never compensated.  This is partially because it was the world's first public radiation emergency, nobody knew what to do - and mostly because of military secrecy.

In short, they were careful and were lucky to have been careful enough."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why is it that when we find a food tasty, we want to eat a lot of it, instead of just keeping it our mouths longer to savour it?","People make a good argument for the evolutionary pressure to find more tasty -- and thus usually calorie-dense -- food, but there's also the fact that food held in the mouth for a long time just doesn't taste the same, at least sometimes. The reason for this is that your mouth is the first stage of digestion, not just in a physical sense (chewing your food to make it easier to get to your stomach, where the real heavy lifting of digestion is done), but also from a chemical sense. Your saliva is filled with an enzyme called [amylase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase), which works in the same way that other enzymes do: it helps to break down large molecules (in this case, starches) down into smaller molecules (in this case, sugars).

You can easily test this at home. If you hold a piece of even the freshest, most delicious bread in your mouth for a while, it will begin to taste sweet. Why? Because the amylase is doing its job, and is converting all of those long chains of starch molecules into the short sugar molecules that your tastebuds recognise as 'sweet'. The mere act of holding it in your mouth changes how it tastes, so if you want that delicious fresh-bread flavour, you're going to have take another bite."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: What do people mean by ”the exception that proves the rule”?,"If you claim that an exception to a rule exists, that must mean you accept the rule itself also exists.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is a housing market crash a bad thing?,">I can't see the downside to houses getting cheaper.

You're only thinking about buyers, not owners. For people who already own homes, if home values fall quickly, owners can find themselves underwater on their mortgages, which means they must either stay in the house until the market recovers or sell and lose money.

When home prices drop during housing market crash, homeowners can end up owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth and can no longer sell their homes to get out from under crushing mortgage payments. People with floating interest rate mortgages will suddenly see their monthly mortgage payments skyrocket because their interest rates have gone way up, if they cannot make the new, higher payments, they will lose their homes to foreclosure and often have to file for bankruptcy in the process, ruining their credit and their ability to obtain future mortgages or other types of loans for many years.

In short, housing market crashes can financially decimate homeowners.

Edit: I didn't plan on addressing any of the comments on here but I've seen enough comments along the lines of ""homeowners deserve it"" or ""it's their fault for gambling on a home loan"" or ""their fault for not planning better"" or ""I have to pay rent so its good that homeowners suffer like me"" that I need to speak up. People making this comments are ignorant and spiteful. The vast majority of homeowners are middle class families who bought their homes to live in. Their homes are the only thing they will ever own with substantial value and the only thing they will ever own of substantial value that they can pass on to their children. So much of the reason for racial wealth inequality in the U.S. is because for a really long time (and to some extent, still today), black people could not get home loans and thus could not pass on a home to their children to build up inter-generational wealth the way that white people could.  Yes, there are people out there who own homes for shitty reasons such as flipping or renting, but when you're shitting on homeowners, you are by and large shitting on the average family. Does that make you feel good?"
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why does a higher heartrate not burn more calories when exercising than in the ""Fat Burning Zone"" which is about 15 BPM lower?","It does. And this whole fat burning zone thing is a misinterpretation of the science.

Your body has two main stores of energy, fat and carbs. Carbs are easier for the body to turn into energy but it’s harder to store, your body still maintains a reserve of about 2000 calories worth of carbs, anything over is turned into fat.

Your body wants to use these stores of carbs only when it really has to, say you’re running from a tiger or chasing prey. So it’s designed to actually use mainly fat for energy when you are resting and only use those carbs when you are going full out. When resting you use 90% fat 10% carbs for energy and when running full speed you use 90% carbs 10% fat. But you are still using say 20x more energy than when you are when resting, so still burning more fat.

The idea of the “fat burning zone” is using this higher proportion of fat burned, however in total of calories from both sources, you still burn more by running faster, though get diminishing returns from fat. And at the end of the day those carb stores are replenished by the food you eat, and any extra is turned into fat anyways. 

At the end of the day what matters is calories in calories out. There are various tricks you can play to improve these to lose weight, for example running slower may mean you can run for much longer without getting winded and burn more calories total. But it’s still calories in calories out."

Sleep is an unconscious act and we have no executive control over it, we just *fall* or *shift* into a sleep state."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 why do we find so many dinosaur skeletons but so few skeletons of our own ancestors like Lucy?,"Lucy (*Australopithecus afarensis*) lived about 3 million years ago. The first things we'd look at and call ""our ancestors"" in that way aren't much older, maybe 6 million years at most. Until *Homo erectus* these beings exclusively lived in east-to-south Africa and were a pretty small part of the ecosystem there.

Dinisaurs (excluding birds) existed for **200 million years** and for almost all of that time they were the dominant large life on the planet.

So not only have we been around for, like, 1/40 the time as they were, but we're also a handful of species that lived in one small part of the world for most of that time. 'Dinosaur' isn't one lineage like hominids - 'dinosaur' means *millions* of species over that time, in every possible niche - big, small, apex predator, little bug eater, jurassic equivalent of a cow, etc. 

There's LOADS of individual dinosaur species that have less fossil evidence than Lucy's species - most are known from only one single fossil find."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is a 555 Timer and what makes it so versatile?,"It's really useful for digital signals for there to be a line that goes ON/OFF/ON/OFF/ON/OFF over and over again quickly. That's a square wave, but it's also what's called a ""clock signal,"" and it's a key part of digital circuits.

A 555 is useful because it's a really easy way to generate a clock signal with a wide variety of speeds.

A couple of really basic examples of when a clock signal might be useful:

* A clock. Every time the signal changes, advance something slightly. Choose the right speed for the signal and the thing that happens, and you've now got a clock.
* Sounds. Send the on/off signal to a speaker. The speed of the signal is now a frequency.

Most importantly, for digital circuits, a clock signal is a critical synchronization tool that's fundamental to how they're constructed."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: How is Charcoal activated and what makes it different from normal charcoal?,Activated charcoal contains many tiny pores which will trap molecules of a certain size while not affecting smaller molecules. It is made by subjecting charcoal to high temperature steam which breaks down the charred remains of the cells in the wood leaving tiny pores behind. There are various guides showing you how to make activated charcoal at home. The results is generally not as good as the industrial made activated charcoal as you have less control on the size of the pores and generally make less pores then the commercial stuff. But it is certainly possible.
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How were the Manhattan Project scientists able to predict the possibility of the atmosphere igniting after using an atomic bomb, and how did they come to the conclusion that the atmosphere wouldn't ignite?","If you pumped enough energy into air (or really, pretty much anything) the atoms that make up the air will fuse together to make heavier elements (Nitrogen combining to make either magnesium and helium or oxygen and carbon). This would release a lot of energy, the same mechanism that makes a hydrogen bomb work. This energy could (potentially) fuel further nitrogen-nitrogen reactions, releasing more energy and so on into an every increasing explosion. This is what they were worried about.  


However reaction requires a LOT of energy. As the explosion happens, it expands outward in a sphere, and as it expands the energy spreads out so that the ""local"" energy in any particular spot drops quickly. Moreover, only a portion (a tiny portion typically) will actually go into making the nitrogen atoms collide and collisions would actually be pretty rare, the actual atoms in air are pretty spread out.  


The Mahhatan project scientists calculated the very upper limit for the energies that a bomb would create, along with the very lower bound for when fusion would occur in the atmosphere. From those calculations, they determine that the atomic bomb would not have nearly enough energy to fuse nitrogen. Furthermore, they also calculated that even if nitrogen fusion occurred, the reaction would fizzle out and it would not be enough to fuse more nitrogen. The world was safe."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How are people able to solve a Rubix Cube in only a few seconds?,"I feel alot of explanations on here are a bit misleading. I'm a speedcuber. My best time is 8.22 seconds. I'm not world class but I'm probably decent.

Basically the cube is solved (by most people) in 4 steps. Solving the cross (4 edge pieces), then the first 2 layers (solving 8 pieces around the cross), then the last layer through 2 steps, orienting the last layer pieces then permuting them. This is where I see most people get it wrong. The last 2 steps are done using algorithms. This is probably 1/3 of the solve. The whole solve is NOT algorithms, nor do speedcubers plan out the entire solve in their head beforehand. Even the most skilled speecubers can't plan out that much, unless it's an incredibly lucky scramble, which then maybe they can plan out 2/3 of the solve. 

I usually plan out 5-10% of my solve in my ""inspection time"" (15 seconds before I solve where I'm allowed to look at the cube). The rest of the solve is figured out as I go through it. I've practiced enough to be able to do turns without looking or thinking about them too much, so I'm able to look at other pieces and plan ahead. This planning ahead is what I do for the entire solve, over and over. This is how speedcubers figure out what to do on the spot, without having many pauses. Tracking pieces while they move around the cube at extreme speeds and making split second decisions comes from practice. Then the last layer is performing the right algorithms fast. I probably average 6-7 turns per second throughout my solve but the fastest people average 10-12. So they're able to solve it in 4-6 seconds instead of my 8-11 seconds."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does my electric company know what exactly is using the electricity?,"Depends.

Some of it may be reasonable guesses (your base usage on days you wouldn't need AC vs the spike on hot days).

Some of it may be based on load monitoring and what that tells them. e.g. The compressor coil for your fridge and AC are going to have identifiable start up characteristics, and then the increased draw of them can be extrapolated vs the background levels of things like lighting that's relatively static. They may not be able to tell a toaster from a curling iron, but with a clever enough meter they can probably tell a blow dryer from a toaster based on the motor.

Utilities have used (and use) both methods, as well as smart appliances that ""talk back"" to the grid for those sorts of things.

The smart appliances are usually ""big"" appliances like your AC or water heater that you've agreed to letting them turn them down/off at periods of peak demand."

There are smaller airports with plenums and oversized HVAC systems but you’d have to localize the HVAC systems for each gate instead of just using chilled water systems before flights. 

Taller ceilings help dissipate the heat around the entire building. Also, like someone else mentioned, airports are basically symbolic welcome mats to tourists & businesspeople alike so a great deal of expensive architecture goes into them. Some of the most expensive firms serve as the architects of record on them."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do dishwashers remove E Coli and other organics from our dishes. Are they really safe.,"165F kills E. Coli instantly. 155F kills E. Coli in around 15 seconds. Since this temperature is sustained for much longer throughout the cycle than just a few seconds it's still effective in killing most pathogens and bacteria.

This is something that is often used in cooking too, for meats especially. For example a lot of people cook chicken to 155F internal temperature, even if the recommendation to kill salmonela is also around 165F. But chicken breast as we all know is a fickle dish and it's easy to end up with a dry and crumbly chicken breast. But this can be avoided if its cooked to a lower internal temperature as long as its sustained long enough to kill bacteria."

Given those facts, we're probably not the one true reality (cuz there's only one). 

Of course, it depends heavily on the IF part. We don't know if it's possible or if there is any reason to want do it. There is no evidence, yet, that it is (or isn't) true. If it was true, there would be little-to-no practical impact on you, specifically. It's not like we comprehend what we're missing out on. maybe it's a little scary to think we exist at the whim of some person simulating us, but I don't personally see how it is any different than the normal existential dread of being a tiny, insignificant mind that will one day disappear into nothingness and it could happen anytime from random accidents."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why are dangerous chemicals added to street drugs? Who benefits from this, and how?","The most important thing to consider here is that the low level drug dealers ""cutting"" their products with other substances generally have no training whatsoever in chemistry or medicine, and so they may not be making fully informed decisions about efficacy, safety, or sensation. Someone may add borax or some shit because it makes the burn feel right, not based on any underlying science. This should inform how you feel about everything that follows. 

As for why it's done, it allows you to sell more of your drug than you actually have. It's not like the government is there to make sure your product is pure and it's not like your customer will notice if you sell them 98% pure cocaine even though you originally bought 99% pure cocaine. Another problem is that since all of this is illegal and completely unregulated, everyone is doing it. So if the guy making the cocaine makes it 95% pure, and then someone else buys it and ""cuts"" it to 95% of its original strength that gets it to 90% of its original strength, then someone else does the same thing and if there are 5 people in the chain each only adding 5% of the weight in impurities, the final concentration ends up as 77%. 

Since street level dealers get their drugs fairly far along in this chain, they may get some product that is pretty impure from the start, and so they may decide to try to add substances that give their customers the impression of quality or strength. This is where adding other drugs like fentanyl comes in, as fentanyl is easy to get super cheap and is effective even in low doses. A street level dealer may try to add in a bit of it to give his product more ""oomf"" since it didn't start off that great to begin with."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 what it means to “process“ your emotions,"for me: start with the most basic understanding of what you’re feeling right now, and try to identify the why from it. “i’m annoyed because…”

usually, the base feeling isn’t all that’s going on—you’re rarely just annoyed, just angry, just disappointed, with nothing behind that. so once you’ve named the base emotion and source, the next step is identifying why the source is triggering the base emotion—yeah, really. “i’m annoyed because we had made plans, and now the plans are changing. i’m no longer sure what’s going on, so i’m having a hard time planning the rest of the afternoon with the new schedule. ohhhhhh—i’m annoyed at this change because it’s making me anxious.”

boom, new emotion. okay, so now we know we’re responding to a situation that’s making us anxious by expressing annoyance. in order to deal with the annoyance, we *actually* have to deal with the anxiety first—so the next step is to identify what you need in a given moment to resolve the root feeing. “i’m anxious about our plans changing because i expected the day to look one way, and now i don’t know what the day looks like. i need the new plans to be expressed clearly so that i can recalibrate my expectations for the day.”

once we identify the thing we’re feeling, cause of what we’re feeling, and any root emotions *behind* those feelings, it’s a lot easier to work from the bottom up to manage the whole situation. the feeling of annoyance is processed by understanding exactly what we’re annoyed about and, with that knowledge, identifying and taking actionable steps to resolve the situation. processing doesn’t always mean “making the feeling go away,” it can also mean “gaining a better understanding of the feeling and situation,” but that’s how i usually approach it"
explainlikeimfive,eli5 How does a coup d’etat actually work?,"In this case, the answer is that it probably wouldn't have worked no matter how well they occupied the building. 

For a coup to work, you have to remove the people currently leading the government, and somehow coerce or convince the people who are in charge of the apparatus of the state (the generals, the higher bureaucrats, the chiefs of industry, etc) to follow the new government to follow your lead, then gain power of the communication apparatus to make sure that your messages are the only ones getting out, and then the population at large has to be okay enough with the new state of affairs to not revolt. 

This is pretty easy in a non-democratic state- why does a peasant care who the current dictator is, and what could he do about it if he did care? It's much harder in a democratic country where the rewards for following the coup leaders are fairly small.

If you're the head of the police in Berlin, for example, do you say ""Oh, what a good deal if I throw in with this lot!"" or ""Hey, I'm comfy as I am- round up the boys, crack open the good weapons lockers, and let's go bust some seditious skulls""?

If you're really interested, an author named Edward Luttwak wrote a book on the subject of how one works- ""Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook"""
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If planes fly empty to maintain their airport slots, does it mean that people massively deciding to fly less wouldn't change a thing?","The assumption during the pandemic was that the lower passenger counts were _temporary_.  Airlines were willing to operate at a loss in order to keep their operations the same because they believed (correctly) that people would return to flying shortly after the pandemic was over.  Reducing then rebuilding operations was calculated to be more expensive than just continuing to operate as normal in the short term.

If they believed the drop would be permanent, they would not maintain operations at the current scale.  They would reduce the number of flights offered and scale back their operations to accommodate the new normal of passenger load.

By way of analogy, if your boss tells you that this month, your paycheck is going to be 50% of what you expected, you aren't going to sell your home or your car - you are going to dip into savings to ride out the month of lower income.  However, if he tells you that _every_ paycheck is going to be 50% lower, you'll make lifestyle changes."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5: How did philologists (people who study ancient languages) learn to decipher ancient texts, if there was no understandable translation available upon discovery?","Two ways: 1 finding cases where it's translated into another language, that's why the rosetta stone was such a big deal, it had several languages all saying the same thing on it, one of which was ancient greek, which we already knew so they could use that translation to work backwards.

The other way, is what another commenter said, you look at where words pop up, if you keep seeing a word show up on things at greengrocers and farms, it's probably a plant of some kind.

And once you know a few words it starts to become possible to work out the others through context."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5 - If RNA was created by a soup of chemicals, is it possible that it's being randomly created in pockets around the world? and could those random rna strands create life out of nowhere?","Well a few things.  

1.  When you have random RNA being generated, the chances of it forming a self replicating molecule are ridiculously small.  When it happened on earth, it took potentially a billion years.  
2.  The conditions that existed on earth when life developed no longer exist.  There are no longer blood-warm seas filled with tons of organic molecules.  There may be some RNA being randomly made, but much less than during Earth's early history.  
3.  Assuming a new form of life did spontaneously generate, it would have to compete with the existing forms of life.  We know that when life first evolved, it wasn't very efficient or ""good"" at living.  It took a long time to evolve into the modern rugged, adaptable, and fast replicating forms it has today.  A new form of life would probably get bullied out of existence by existing life forms."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is the difference and/or benefit of a DLSR camera vs. a standard phone camera?,"The size of the sensor in the DSLR is much larger, resulting in better quality pictures. 

You can change lenses on DSLR cameras with dozens of choices to meet your specific needs. I have 13 different lenses for my cameras. 

DSLR lenses have adjustable apertures and you have full manual control over all camera settings. All settings have a wider range of adjustments than what’s possible on a phone camera. 

This list could go on forever with a bunch of technical stuff. Pretty much the only advantage a phone camera has is that the phone is pocket size and you always have it with you."

Theyre reffering to how much pure BLOOD. There is a lot more mucus / discharge and tissue that makes up the rest of the volume.

Secondly the issue with measurements. I think teaspoons and tablespoons get mixed up a lot. A teaspoon is about 5ml, a tablespoon is closer to 20ml.

If your testosterone is suppressed to a *very* low level (like, ""nuke all the testosterone in your body"" low), you will stop having nightly erections. A side effect is that your penis will essentially ""shrink"" due to a lack of  use, making it *very* painful to get erections afterwards. Having regular boners ensures it can still be used in the future when you want to.

The random ones during the day are just because you are a young guy. They'll happen way less frequently once you get older."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If someone committed a crime in Antartica, what would happen to them?","Depends on where you're from.

For example, The Antarctic Act 1994 extends the laws of every part of the United Kingdom to UK nationals in Antarctica. Additionally, the Commissioner of the British Antarctic Territory may enact laws for the territory.

Americans have The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (enacted 12 October 1984) which covers crimes committed by Americans or crimes committed against Americans. Any American who is outside of the United States, but not in another country, is still subject to certain U.S. laws. All Americans committing a crime, and any foreigner committing a crime against an American outside of a sovereign state, are subject to prosecution in a U.S. federal court. This includes international waters and Antarctica. Although nations claim territory in Antarctica, the United States does not recognize these claims.

This theory was tested not too long ago in 2018 when a stabbing occurred at the Bellingshausen Station, a Russian research station on King George Island. The perpetrator was Sergey Savitsky who stabbed Oleg Beloguzov. Savitsky surrendered to the manager of the station and, 11 days later, was placed on a flight back to Russia where he was placed on house arrest. February 8th, 2019, Savitsky was at a preliminary hearing at the Vasileostrov District Court of Saint Petersburg. Savitsky was remorseful and was willing to accept a criminal punishment rather than rehabilitation. Beloguzov was forgiving of Savitsky and proposed dropping the case. The public prosecutor was supportive of Beloguzov's proposal, and noted that Savitsky was remorseful and had no prior criminal record. Judge Anatoly Kovin decided to drop the case."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do F1 cars overtake each other if there is not such a large difference in the top speeds?,"The typical F1 pass:

Step 1: Trailing car follows in the “slipstream” of the leading car, taking advantage of the lead car’s draft to gain speed down a long straight.  The car in front is doing more work moving the stagnant air and can’t go as fast.

Step 2: Once you have a good “run” and are moving faster than the lead car, pull back out of the slipstream to get traction back heading into a turn.  Downforce cars like F1 can’t follow closely through corners, they need air moving over the wings to grip the road surface.  Carry more speed into the corner and complete the overtake.

If your car is *way* faster than the opponent, you can just burn ‘em on a straight too.  Some cars are overtuned for cornering or just underpowered and you’ll see them get eaten up in drag races before the cars even need to corner."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How does a well work? Is there a finite amount of water in a drinking well? Why is it okay to drink? Do they somehow replenish water or if they dry up that is it?,"Wells work using the water underground. The ground is full of little cracks and lets water seep down into it when it rains. Some of this is lost on the surface due to evaporation but some of stays in the ground.  Using scientific methods we can see how far below the ground the water is. This is known as the water table. If you dig a hole that goes deeper than the water table, the water, following gravity, will flow into the gap you have just dug. This fills it up the hole and is how wells replenish thier water. 

The best example i can give of this is digging holes in the sand at the beach. The water table there is pretty much level with the sea. When you start digging the sand is dry, then it seems to get more 'wet' the deeper you go. And when you get below the water level the hole fills with water quickly."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are there more tornadoes in the US compared to the rest of the world?,"Tornadoes like to develop when cold air masses and warm air masses collide over flat land. The US just so happens to have the jet stream to the north of it (which being cold air down from Canada and the arctic) and the very warm Gulf of Mexico below an area of very flat topography. Those three things combine to create tornadoes. There’s not really anywhere else in the world where those three criteria come together so perfectly, hence we seem to have a monopoly on tornadoes in the central and southeast US.

Edit to add: flat land doesn’t technically have anything to do with tornadoes forming. However, tornadoes are very finicky and are easily dispersed by sudden changes in elevation. That’s why flat land helps them survive long enough to become significant."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: The Big Bang did not start as a singular point but happened everywhere at once.,"There aren't any great analogies, in the sense that none of the analogies you're going to encounter are actually fully analogous. As human beings, we've never experienced in our lives anything even approximately accurate to what happened during the Big Bang.

The most straightforward analogy is the balloon analogy. Imagine you have a balloon and you use a Sharpie to put a tiny dot on that balloon. That dot represents the entire universe at the beginning of the Big Bang. Now imagine blowing up the balloon. The dot gets bigger. But it doesn't get bigger from expanding away from a particular location. All of the little tiny ink particles in the dot are moving away from all of the other tiny ink particles and it doesn't matter where you are in the dot at the beginning, you see the same amount of expansion as you're blowing up the balloon. If you imagine sitting on top of one of these tiny ink particles, no matter where you are, all of the other ink particles you see are moving away from you at the same rate. 

There are some flaws to this analogy, but I'm not going to mention them because it might actually make it easier for you to understand if I avoid pointing out some of the holes."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5 why does licking your lips make them more dry,"Your skin, including your lips, is not wet with water but with oils. Water and oil does not mix. The oil in your skin helps make your body watertight as the water can not penetrate the oily layer. Your spit however is water based. When you lick your lips you might think that you are adding moisture by coating it with spit, but what you are actually doing is scraping away some of the oil on the lips making it dryer. This is why in order to fix dry lips you need to use an oil based substance of some kind. You can use petroleum gel, lip balm, lipstick, or any other similar substance. Similarly taking a shower can dry out your skin, soaps and alcohol are even worse as they dissolve the fat. But a moisturizing cream can add back some of that fat in the skin."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does anesthesia work,"Short answer: we're not really sure.

A bit longer answer: The most popular theory is that molecules of anesthetic drugs connect to certain molecules called receptors in your brain. Once there they prevent other molecules from doing their job, basically switching off certain parts and functions of the brain.

How EXACTLY do they switch off consciousness is still under a lot of research."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: If two countries go to war, how can the opposing army know which army is theirs without accidently shooting their own teammates?","It's difficult!

Countries that fight each other generally will have different camouflage patterns, but not always. (Especially for vehicles, it seems, for some reason.) That's one reason you see Ukrainian soldiers wearing yellow armbands and Russian vehicles with Zs painted on them.

But hiding is really important in war. If you can see someone well enough to go ""that's enemy camouflage!"" the camouflage isn't doing its job well. So you can't always tell by sight. Often soldiers will be shooting at other people they can barely see - or might want to shoot, just as long as they can be sure they're not friendly.

One way to help with this is the simple (in theory) practice of knowing where your guys are and what they're doing. If you're launching an attack, know that the rough plan is for this squad to move here, that squad to move there. To know that there are survivors of a friendly unit in this area, but everyone has been pulled back from that area.

A good ""command, control and communications"" system will keep your side up-to-date. Your squad manages to rush on ahead, you radio in to tell your platoon HQ, and they tell others.

A simple principle, but very hard to manage in practice.

Aircraft also have ""identification, friend or foe"" systems, since they're often shot at without being seen. These lets a friendly aircraft or ground system ping them and check if they respond with a 'friendly' code. I'm not sure if any other vehicles have incorporated these; I don't think so."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How do these Chinese Content Farms, where dozens of people sit packed in front of selfie rings in dilapidated locations, work? What are they streaming?","The big gap between streaming in China as opposed to in the west, is the way it's viewed. In the US people dream of becoming a star, and work mostly individually online to do so. In China, the career is more guided by agencies and companies. In the U.S., streamers make most of their own money, while in China they are beholden to companies and often only receive a small share as they are coached on appealing to a wider audience. 

The relationship between streamers and users is also a different, significantly more para-social than the usual streams on twitch.

As an example of this effect in microcosm, take the live streaming of young women on Chinese websites. 

From the audience perspective, in wide swaths of china, poorer men, who have little chances of a romantic match given the gender disparity, often engage with streamers, for the chances to feel like they're the big brother to a little sister, like they matter to them. Being a big brother often means spending money to ""save"" their streamers. **The more you spend,** **the more well respected you are, both to the streamers** ***and to the online communities surrounding them***. That last piece applies not just to the specific form of streaming targeted at young lonely poor men, but to nearly every variety of streaming in China. In theory, however, this acting as a ""big brother"" is a fabrication the streamers keep up, a joke everyone but the most devoted viewers are in on, like simps for streamers in the west, right? Unfortunately, that's not the case.

From the perspective of the young women streamers, those viewers actually **are** acting as big brothers, paying to ensure their job and position, their increasing rise in their agency or organization. Furthermore, to increase popularity, **many young women engage in punishment games**. For an idea, think the sort of excessive embarrassment found on Japanese game shows, except significantly more malicious. Remember, **these women are beholden to their agencies**, so they can't simply ignore pushes toward that sort of content. They put themselves essentially at risk to increase views, and hope that their more well paying clients come through. Many of these women are being manipulated emotionally by those companies to **view their audience as ""big brothers""**. This sort of two-way street makes for a significantly better paying audience, with plenty who can barely afford their current lifestyle dipping further into their pockets to ""save"" their streamers. 

The end result is that many of the para-social relationships developed here spread to far more of the streamer's lives than otherwise, their streams become not just about content but about their lives in every sense. Things like ""she actually had a boyfriend"" are incredibly uncommon as a result, many of these kinds of streamers themselves don't draw the necessary boundaries to have separate public and private lives.

The market for that kind of ""younger sister"" streaming is **fucking huge**, and that ""big brother"" portion, and the associated risks of failure, given that many of these streamers aren't necessarily wealthy to begin with, and are hoping not just to become a star, but to escape problematic financial conditions in a country with limited social safety nets, results less in a ""city of dreams"" scenario like hollywood, but instead in the sort of desperation that drives people to move under bridges for streaming to maximize payoff. That sort of desperation is the main reason they'll go so far.

To be honest I'm barely scratching to surface of one sector of streaming in China, I hadn't even gotten to the sexualization present given the lack of (legally) available porn in China

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: How does flipping up my rear view mirror still show the same view, just less bright?",Your rear view mirror is composed of a piece of glass and a reflective surface behind it. The glass will reflect about half the light and the surface behind it reflects the other half. This is how all mirrors work. But the leaver in your rear view mirror allow you to flip the reflective surface away leaving just the black interior of the housing. So only about half the light gets reflected and the other gets absorbed into the black paint. This is useful for when you have someone with bright headlights or the sun behind you.
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5 : I have bad service, how do ads still play perfectly?","So there are services called CDN. or content delivery networks. Their purpose is to let content providers store cached copies of their content on servers closer to where this content would be requested from. A lot of advertisers will contract the services of a CDN to put copies of their ads on servers that are usually installed directly in the data centers of service providers.

Because of this, the video you're trying to watch ends up being on a server on the other side of the country or in a different country, but that ad you're being forced to watch is probably coming from a server within your internet service providers internal network and doesn't even have to go out to the internet to stream the data to play it."

* It has to be docile enough to interact with people and live in captivity
* It has to eat something that's both readily available and not more valuable eaten directly
* It has to reproduce quickly under human direction

Goats may have been one of the first animals domesticated for use as food. They eat grass and plant materials that people can't eat themselves.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How is artillery so precise?,"The most basic answer is math.  The science of ballistics is all just math.  The weight of the projectile, the angle it’s fired at, the charge of the propellant, the length of the barrel, gravity, wind resistance, temperature, the curvature of the earth, humidity, moon phase, (maybe not moon phase). All these things are factors that can be put in a calculation to accurately predict where that projectile will hit.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What's the difference between ice and snow? Aren't they both frozen water?,"Have you ever gotten a bowl of ice cream, let it melt (on accident or on purpose), and then tried to freeze it again? Instead of turning back into ice cream, it freezes into a hard block.

This is because when ice cream is made it is constantly being stirred, letting air be captured in the freezing cream and forcing smaller crystals to form. These two things don't happen to a bowl of cream that is just set in the freezer, so the bowl freezes without any extra air and into fewer, larger, stronger crystals.

Snow is like ice cream; while it was freezing, it was being stirred by the moving air in a cloud. There's air captured inside it, and the ice crystals are smaller, weaker, softer, and more numerous. Sure, it's still ice crystals, but the shape of those crystals are different enough to change so much about it.

Meanwhile, ""ice"" is usually the larger crystals without air inside of them. So they have all the properties of ice, but none of captured air or small crystals.

explainlikeimfive,eli5 what do golf caddies actually do. why do you need one,"Ontop of the carrying stuff, at nice courses with good caddies the caddy absolutely will make you a better player. They will see you’re misses early(range,first few holes) and give you advice around that. They know the green complexes well and will always want to leave you the best putt. They know which areas on the course are dead spots. Which areas are good misses. (Ie. short is safe, because long is absolutely dead). The carrying of clubs is a minor thing for amateurs but…

On a professional level, they carry and clean and rake all bunkers which allows the golfer to absolutely focus on what he needs to do to win. They spend days before the tournament getting yardages from random markers(trees, bushes, bunkers, cart paths). As an amateur my caddy will tell me to play a XX yard shot, as a pro the caddy knows the players yardages and will recommend specific clubs with shot shapes to match. Ontop of all that, they provide some mental and emotional support to their player. Instead of being alone in a tense situation you have someone your familiar with on all levels. They can break the tension, talk you down from being upset, and just provide some company during a 4.5 hour round where you’re only taking 70 swings"

EASA (idk about the USA) have minimum fuel requirements that make it a legal requirement to carry enough fuel to fly for 30 minutes at 1500 feet above the destination or alternate airport 

this is kinda like how a car will have a Reserve Fuel Tank, this means that even when your car says ‘i’m empty’ it has enough to get to the nearest petrol station.

you must report any dip below minimum fuel to ATC when in flight by calling ‘Mayday Fuel’ this allows the ATC to put you to the front of the queue and get you on the ground

EASA enforce this because it’s better to have a pilot get in trouble for not having enough fuel left, than it is for the plane to run out of fuel mid air

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why does embarrassment manifest in such strong physical responses such as blushing, sweating, loss of breath, etc?","shame/embarrassment activate the same sympathetic nervous system pathways as danger, so the physiological response is the fight/flight (or freeze, fawn, etc) one. that activation releases hormones like adrenaline & cortisol that create those physiological effects."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: why are non-digital weighing scales still heavily used across many professional sports, hospitals, etc?","For professional sports, like boxing or MMA, it almost certainly for dramatic effect. It’s a lot cooler and builds anticipation as a boxer steps onto the scale before a bout and they have to slide weights across one by one and the final weight has to be positioned so carefully for beam to balance. If it’s just step up and an immediate digital read out, there’s no drama or showmanship. 

For hospitals, usually there is an engineering group that standardize all of the equipment. They don’t replace things that last 10+ years just because there is new technology. And while accuracy is important, it for not need any more accuracy that the mechanical scales already offer. The scales need to be durable, reliable and repairable. Mechanical beam scales have proven this for decades, so what’s the advantage of replacing them."
explainlikeimfive,eli5 Why is the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 so ineffective against companies today?,"Since the 70’s or so, antitrust has been interpreted from the perspective of harm vs. benefit to the consumer. As long as a merger is supposedly of benefit to the consumer, it is permitted. Benefit, in this case, generally just means lower prices. The evidence required to show that prices would be lower is pretty minimal, and after the merger is approved there is no actual enforcement requiring prices to actually go down. This is exacerbated by government enforcement agencies not being provided enough resources to effectively argue against corporate claims of consumer benefits in court. As long as corporations go through a pro forma ritual of saying they are acting for the benefit of the consumer, they can do what they want."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How is Pi calculated?,"> I know the definition of pi is circumference / diameter, but is that really how we get all the digits of pi?

That's the historical definition, and that's probably how people got the approximate value of pi (slightly more than 3) thousands of years ago.

At that time, they didn't care about the digits (they didn't even invent decimal writing), so they often used the approximation 22/7  which was discovered to be a rather good approximation by Archimedes. (more precisely he proved that 223/71 < pi < 22/7 using a geometrical approximation of a circle by polygons)

But no we don't use real circles to measure pi since a very very long time. 

> We just get a circle, measure it and calculate?

Fun fact, if we had a perfect circle the size of the observable universe, and we were able to measure its circumference and diameter up to the atomic scale, we would only get 40 digits of the decimal expansion. 

So obviously, that would not work, even with the best available equipement.

> Or is there some other formula or something that we use to calculate the however many known digits of pi there are?

Yes, there are formulas. Some formulas are easier than other. For example, a very simple formula that will get you as close to pi as you want is the following :

pi = 4 * (1- 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + 1/13 + ... + 1/(2n+1) + ... )

Each term you add will gte you closer to pi. The problem is that this formula gets closer to pi very very slowly (You need 200 terms to get an approximation that is only as good as 22/7) .The proof of this formula is not that hard (accessible to any undergrad) but perhaps not at the ELI5 level.
 

Fortunately for us, we have other formulas, that are more complicated to understand, but that will get you as close to pi as you want much quicker. For example : 

pi = 2 \* (1 + 1/3 + (2\*3)/(3\*5) + (2\*3\*4)/(3\*5\*7)+ ...) that will get you 10 correct digits after 30 terms

And many other formulas far more effective, but that are really ugly.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why are deserts filled with such fine sand while everywhere else is rocky?,"Sand is everywhere. Regular dirt has plenty of sand in it, it's also on beaches and in the bottom of the ocean. So, what's really going on isn't that sand is present in deserts, it's ""What happened to everything else?"". In other words, why isn't there clay, dirt, etc.

The answer is, those other forms of pulverized rock require moisture to keep them from drying out, and being blown away in the wind. Sand is the smallest particle size that won't just be taken off by the wind into the next county. The Sahara desert is constantly blowing off dust into the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, and, in fact, dust from the Sahara makes it all the way across the Atlantic to be deposited in South America, providing an influx of extra minerals and nutrients. According to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-satellite-reveals-how-much-saharan-dust-feeds-amazon-s-plants) approximately 22,000 tons of phosphorus is fed into the Amazon each year, part of the annual payload of 182 **MILLION** tons of dust blowing across the Atlantic Ocean."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why does lightning look like it goes from top down if it actually goes from the ground up?,"Imagine a row of cars at a stop light. When the light turns green , the first car goes, this creates a space behind them and the second car goes. All the cars are moving forward but if you follow the position of the gap between cars, it moves backwards. The gap starts at the front and moves toward the back. 

When lightning strikes, it is the air towards the cloud that gets ionized first, creating the flash of light. This ionization travels towards the ground as more air becomes charged. So while the charge of electricity is moving towards the sky, the result of it, the ionized air, has to start at the clouds and move down. Just like the first car at a stop light has to move first before the one behind it."

You have a large volume of dirt, which is heavier and more compacted, which is now wet and has no roots in it to suck up the moisture. It stays wet, while the small part around the plant's roots starts to dry out, both from the roots and being closer to the surface. So you have to water it again. Now the rootless dirt is even wetter. Dirt that stays sopping wet for long periods of time tends to rot, and the resulting fungus will attack your plant's roots."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What does high IQ mean anyway?,"IQ is an attempt to measure human intelligence. It could be thought of as a measure of how quickly you can learn something. 

The IQ mostly measures abstract reasoning rather than content knowledge. That's why people say it's a series of puzzles. You have to (as quickly as possible) figure out the pattern presented and extend it. Or find the most efficient way to reconstruct a pattern that's been scattered. Sort of like a rubic's cube needs to be put back together. The patterns become more abstract as you progress, so they become harder to figure out. The reasoning being that if you can still solve them, you must be exceptionally intelligent.

Just to reiterate, the IQ test is not designed to measure content knowledge. You can be brilliant and not be a walking encyclopedia. But when learning about gravity, having a high IQ would make it easier to understand what it means for it to be a rate of acceleration or, in math, why tangent lines have practical applications."

The rhD+ gene is dominant, so if **either** of the two genes in the pair is +, then you will express as positive.

The genetic makeup of both of your parents is the same - they both have one gene that is positive and one that is negative.  This results in them both expressing as rhD+.

They both passed to you their copy of the rhD- gene.  Since both of your genes are rhD-, you express as rhD-

-----

Same thing with the blood types.  A and B are dominant genes, while O is not.  Your mum has two copies of the O gene, which means she expresses as O.  Your dad has one copy of the B gene and one copy of the O gene, meaning he expresses as B.  The both passed on to you an O gene, giving you two O genes, so you express as O just like your mum."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do video game console discs now require installation, when we could just put them in and play instantly before? Why did PC discs always require installation","There are two reasons.

The first reason, which is probably the biggest reason, is that optical disc drives are much slower than hard drives installed in modern consoles -- at least about 10 times slower and maybe even worse than that. The data on the disc *may* (see reason 2) actually be all of the data that is needed to play the game. However, it's on the disc, probably in a substantially compressed form, and the amount of data that needs to be loaded per second to provide modern graphics and interactivity is more data than can be read from the optical disc in real time. So that data has to be copied to the much faster hard drive, and perhaps decompressed, for you to be able to play the game.

The second reason is that the disc itself might not actually contain all of the data required for the game. It's not unusual for new consoles to basically just use the disc as a tool to distribute a unique license key that lets the console know you're authorized to download and play a game. You still have to download it and install it, because the only data on the disc is a small amount of data that proves you have the right to do that."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how do noise cancelling headphones work so fast,"This is why noise cancellation works better on low-frequency sounds than high-frequency.  Typically they work best on frequencies lower than [1000 Hz.](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/what-noise-cancelling-headphones-do/) -- that's 1000 times per second.  The electronics must detect the sound and create a cancelling audio waveform faster than that -- say, 10,000 or 50,000 audio measurements per second.

I can't find technical specs for the microprocessor in AirPods, but it's quite common for embedded chips like these to have clock speeds of 10 or 50 *million* code operations per second.  Which means they have time to do on the order of 1000 code operations per audio measurement.

Which is plenty.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 What’s modernism and post-modernism?,"Modernism was a movement in art and culture in the late 19th and early 20th century that was obsessed with new ways of doing things, owing in part to the technological and scientific advances of the era. Modern art, for example, eschewed realism in favor of abstraction and surrealism. Modernists would reject traditional ways of doing things simply because they were traditional. In the words of Vladimir Mayakovsky, a modernist Russian poet, they wanted to “throw all the old ways overboard from the Steamship of Modernity.”

Post-Modernism came about in the mid to late twentieth century and was a reaction to Modernism. Whereas Modernists would reject traditional art and culture, Post-Modernism draws on both traditional as well as Modernist design. Post-Modern architecture for example might be modern in design but with Greek-style columns as a playful reference to Classical architecture. Post-Modern art and design is known for these “references” and commentaries on other work. These references are why Post-Modern art is sometimes considered “meta,” referring to itself or the medium in a provocative way."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: Why did civilizations such as the Pre Dorset, Thule, and Inuit not migrate south if their environments were so harsh and extreme?","It's a matter of specialization.

In nature, there's a concept called ""niche partitioning"". If two species are competing for the same resources (food, living space, etc). There are ultimately 2 outcomes:

1) One of the creatures gets progressively better than the other, outcompeting them to extinction. 

2) Both creatures specialise into different areas, allowing them to live without having to compete against eachother as much, if at all. 

A similar situation can be seen in cultures. 

War between different groups was common in the Americas, even before European settlement, and understandably so. 

If you're a hunter-gatherer society, and your population is growing, you are going to need more land to hunt in, and you hunting there means others can't. (This is a concept known as scarcity)

Since humans are always the most dangerous predator around, and niceties are only afforded when survival isn't an issue, other people are always a significant problem. 

Cultures like the Inuit survived because they understood this, and decided that they'd learn to follow the food, wherever it may be. 

There was a choice: Either fight others to maintain hunting territory, or go somewhere that no one wanted to hunt in. They chose the latter, and went further North. They learned how to survive up there when others didn't care to try, and they were lucky enough to succeed."

The resulting compounds from this reaction are varied - far more varied than their inputs.  Our bodies find these compounds quite tasty - likley because it was an evolutionary advantage to find them so.  Cooking food ""unlocks"" nutritional value not (easily) available in the raw from, so early humans that found cooked food tastier than raw food had better diets, leading to increased survival."

explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Why do we pay ISPs for internet speed, but mobile network operators for the amount of transferred data?","there are more bottlenecks in a mobile (radio) network, due both to technology and cost and available radio spectrum (a lot of it is used for other stuff already, a lot of it just isn't suitable for high data rates)

There are physical limits on how much data (to and from all users at once) can be handled on the set of frequencies the networks are allowed to use.   

Those bottle necks do improve over time, as smaller cells, or better ways to squash and encode data are developed but it's a much more lumpy or punctuated process of evolution than say just sticking a fatter internet pipe, or more pipes in the ground.

If you want to introduce a new way of squashing data onto a radio signal, as well as updating the backbone you need to get every phone or device manufacturer on board and ready for a new standard as well as continue to run older networks alongside newer ones for everyone's existing devices, still using the same set of frequencies and capacities... gradually phasing from one standard to another over time... If you want to use different frequencies, you need to get multiple nation states and goverments to agree which is a massive pain in the bum to do and takes time.

basically mobile networks have a different priority because they have harder limits on resources (bandwidth).

in reality both networks  are constantly improving speed and capacity and both have caps, the caps are just more visible for mobile networks because of the physics of radio."

Fortunately, our digestive system is built pretty tough. We can eat a lot of nasty stuff and our bodies can filter out the bad and keep the good with great success. But there are a few germs which can hurt us badly so we have to be careful. Good food safety is mostly a matter of keeping those dangerous bugs at bay.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Can anyone explain why no engineers thought to make the original USB and HDMI cables be bidirectional?,"To understand this, you need to better understand computer and video cabling at the time.

Cables generally were all designed so that there is only one way to put them in. This ensures that each pin is always in the proper spot--you don't need any extra programming, changes, new board designs anything, everything goes in its perfect spot and always works exactly as its supposed to. One of the things USB and HDMI were meant to do was just work. There were so many weird options and poor performing cables and connectors, these were solving that problem--- it works, its predictable, you don't need other cables, just this one and everything works easy and fine. You literally can't mess it up. Designers know to add this cable, it just works, nothing is gonna go wrong, its simple and effective.

When you go makin unidirectional and plug in any way, you have to address the fact you now have two fully different paths for your cables instead of one. This can be corrected and addressed, but that adds a lot of complications to the entire design and usage process to determine if you plugged it in one way or the other and requires more complicated ports and connectors to manufacture, which of course makes them less reliable... and these were meant to just always work. No questions, it works and is durable and reliable.

They certainly considered making these plug in up or down (they have even stated such for USB), but this was not the prevailing idea at the time, these are more designed to just work with as little issues as possible. HDMI is a bit weirder and theres a lot of stuff built into HDMI that just never got used, and having only 1 configuration was totally fine and still is."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 why splitting a tiny particle can cause such a devastating blast,"Splitting one particle won't. In fact, particles split all the time all around you and even in your own body.  What creates that huge blast is when a huge number of them split all at once. 

When an atom splits, some of its neutrons fly off and it releases some of the energy that was holding them there. And maybe, one of those neutrons hits another atom just right to make it split too. And so on. That's what the ""chain reaction"" is.

However, even in solids, when you get really really small, there's actually a lot of space between the atoms, so it's not very likely a neutron will hit anything. But when you can get a huge number of atoms to split in a chain reaction like this, that's how you get all that energy."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Where do insects go when temperatures drop below -25C in the winter and isn’t the soil frozen for them to go under?,"Obviously this will vary by species. But generally:

Soil doesn’t freeze very deep down. Many insects will burrow down deeper into the soil.

Many will also find protected spaces like crawl spaces under houses or fallen trees and stumps that offer some slight insulation from the cold.

Many insects can also tolerate very low temperatures. They don’t have nearly as much water by weight as other animals so there’s less risk of cell damage from frozen water. So when there’s a hard freeze, they aren’t necessarily injured as we or other vertebrates would."

It's not perfect, though. And infections do occur. Look up perianal abscesses when you get a chance, but not while eating.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: what information is pulled up when immigration officers scan your passport photo page in airports when traveling internationally?,"The officer scans your passport to see basic info: Name, date of birth, country of citizenship, etc. 

The passport page containing that basic info also shows a 'code key' that, when scanned, grants access to the chip which contains the same info. This helps the officer verify that the info shown in your passport is valid, and not a forgery.

For U.S. borders, once your basic info is in the computer, it can then be cross-referenced with various databases: 

* Terrorist Screening Database (FBI)
* Border Crossing Information system of records
* Interagency Border Inspection System
* Other databases, including some created by other international organizations

Other nations do similar things at their borders. They're checking for any red flags. If there are none, and the officer has no reason to suspect foul play, you're granted entry.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How did planes know exactly where to go before GPS was invented?,"Like long range navigation was a total pain the backside pre-GPS. Obviously you can use a map and a compass, if you can see a landmark on the ground to get your bearing from, and then using your indicated speed x the time you've been flying, and that'll give you a rough guide to where you are now; this is called dead reckoning  


THe problem in the air is, often weather gets in the way, meaning you can't see the ground or can only see it from time to time, the wind speed and direction changes your absolute speed - so for example WW2 B-29 bombers attacking Japan found the jet stream when they realised they were flying at an indicated 200 mph but their speed over the ground was either 15mph or 400mph depending which direction they flew in. Also you might want to fly at night  


During WW2 radio beams were used by all sides to guide bombers towards targets, typically meaning a navigator would hold the plane on a course and if it was the right one they'd hear one tone and if ti was the wrong one, they'd hear another. Post-war this got loads more complex and commercial planes used raido beacons at fixed locations to triangulate thier position. By the 1980s Inertial Guidance Systems which had always been around, had become computerised and could use multiple measurments like wind speed, altitude, direction, radio fixed points, aircraft weight and lots of other bits of data to be very, very accurate, but they had to be setup before each flight and, if they got a heavy knock for whatever reason could go wrong

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What is it about tobacco that causes its smoke to seep into walls and linger when other burnt plant material does not (at least not nearly to the same degree)?,"Smoke in general doesn't just generate solid dusty debris like ash, but also liquid vapors which contain tar and other chemicals that stick to and soak into surfaces,

This includes cigarette smoke, which also includes chemicals like nicotine. The nicotine intake from inhaling cigarette smoke is actually a vapor that is mixed in with the smoke.

The tar and liquids in smoke actually do more direct damage to the lungs than the solids.

This is how vaporizers work. They just vaporize the nicotine without burning anything along with flavorings and water vapor. They do not produce the tar or carbon monoxide that cigarettes do.

(THIS DOES NOT MEAN VAPING IS A ""HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE"". THERE ARE STILL VERY DANGEROUS CHEMICHALS IN THE VAPOR, JUST FEWER OF THEM.)

Over time, these liquids build up creating a foul smelling film that gets into everything the smoke touches. Mostly the tar in particular.

When you see the discoloration on the walls in a smoker's home, this is what it is, the tar and vapor elements of the smoke, and it is what generates most of the smell that lingers long term.

It's why the yellow/brown film that you see in homes where smokers have lived is so sticky. It's a huge pain to clean up, and is similar to trying to clean tree sap off of something.

Other particles will stick to it as well, so there is a fair bit of solids mixed into the film cigarette smoke generates (ash mostly). It acts sort of like a glue, and those solid particles also contribute to the odor, but not as much as the sticky liquid parts.

Fabrics pick up this sort of odor very easily and will usually be the first things to start smelling like smoke, but others surfaces will also soak it in and develop enough of a film to keep the odor long term. The more porous a material is, the easier it retains the smoke odor.

Other smoke does this too. If you've ever been in a home after a large house fire, it has a very distinctive odor to it. The sheer volume of smoke creates enough of a film that it happens very quickly, and it is extremely hard to get rid of the smell.

Cigarette smoke takes a little longer to build up because it lacks the volume of smoke that something like a housefire will generate, but due to the sort of constant smoking most smokers do, it builds up faster than you might expect.

Basically, it's the tar mostly, and other chemical vapors in cigarette smoke contribute, with the solid bits like ash that stick to it also contributing to a much lesser degree."

Steam turbines are remarkably efficient for large scale constant frequency power generation.
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: how does software that can detect text generated by ChatGPT work?,"Anomaly detection is the machine learning method to detect unusual spikes in activity: think about a sleep graph, for example, that has random spikes along the line. In some sense, there's a regular pattern to the spikes, but sometimes a really big spike might come out of nowhere. An anomaly detection machine finds those outliers that don't match the pattern/rhythm.

In ChatGPT language models, the model's language output has a high degree of regularity: there aren't many random ""spikes"" of outlier language. That is, it's *too* clean and uniform as a pattern. Real language written and spoken by human beings has a lot of anomalies: random changes in mood, emotion, word choice, syntax, etc.

It's like comparing a handknit scarf to an industrial machine's knit scarf: one might have small mistakes that show it was made by a human hand, whereas the other is almost perfect because the machine follows an exact pattern."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: When a tub of ice cream melts and becomes liquid, why is it ruined even after you freeze it back again?","When you make ice cream it is churned constantly while it freezes. Ice cream makers also have blades that scrape the ice off the inside walls of the vessel since that freezes first. Keeping all the ice cream moving like this as it freezes keeps the ice crystals that form very small. The small ice crystals is what gives fresh ice cream that smooth texture.  When the ice cream has melted and is then refrozen you get much larger ice crystals, which is why it kinda has the texture of a bad snow cone now."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why do datacenters continuously use more water instead of recycling the same water in a closed loop system?,"AH! a question in an area of my expertise. There are at least three variants of water-consuming datacenter cooling.

1. The datacenter captures the hot air coming out of servers. Radiators with cool water circulating through them are used to cool this hot air. The water is heated while the air is cooled. That water is then pumped outside and poured over big fiber boards while a fan blows outside air past them. This evaporates some of the water, and the remainder is cooled by the evaporation. The remaining cooled water is pumped back inside the datacenter and the process repeats.
2. The datacenter uses industrial air conditioning units called CRACs, which have radiators outside the datacenter. The air conditioner compresses a gas, heating it up, and then pumps it through the radiator while a fan blows outside air across the radiators. Once the compressed gas is cooled, it is brought back into the datacenter and allowed to expand, which makes it cold. Air inside the datacenter is blown over a different radiator filled with this cold gas, cooling the datacenter air. On very hot days, the CRAC sprays the outside radiators with water, which evaporates on the radiator and cools it more than the air alone would.
3. The datacenter brings in outside air directly to keep the inside air cool. On hot days, the datacenter's systems will spray a mist of water into the air on its way in. That mist evaporates quickly and cools the outside air further before it reaches the datacenter floor."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What does synthetic oil do for my car that regular oil does not?,"Synthetic oil is basically like very refined regular oil...since it's artificially made they have very tight control over exactly what's in it and what the properties are. They can match it exactly to what the engine needs (lubricity, viscosity, resistance to forming sludge, etc.) and hit that target with very consistent results.

Natural oil is a mixture of natural compounds...its most the stuff you want but there's always some other stuff along for the ride that cause it to not be exactly what you want it to be without a lot of extra refining."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5: How is it possible that Greek yogurt can transform into the consistency of a chocolate brownie, with the addition of baking powder and heat?","The baking powder evolves carbon dioxide when wet, which is why the mix goes fluffy. The heat and chemical changes in the mix cause the yogurt and protein powder proteins (casein and whey) to bind and tangle, forming a structure that can trap the carbon dioxide and not collapse. Acids are often used to set (curdle) milk proteins for cheese-making.  
 
For breads and cakes, the protein is gluten from the flour."

- Not everyone has a smart phone and so can’t install a dedicated app.   
- Authenticator apps can be a pain when you move to a new device. Some will transfer over, others may not. SMS doesn’t have this problem.    
- Almost everyone knows how SMS works, authenticator apps are a bit more complex. Less technically minded people may have trouble installing, setting up, and transferring codes.   
- Even with SMS being less secure, it’s still more secure than nothing at all. Every extra layer or step the attacker has to go through decreases your chance of getting compromised. It’s just not the best step to take."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why are dinosaurs buried so deep? Did rock form over them?,">Did rock form over them

Yes, that's why geologists can date rocks, sediments get constantly deposited in seas / lakes / rivers / lowlands etc., and form layers one over another.

The reason we can find them is because eventually those rocks get uplifted by tectonic activity (stuff moves around) and are now hills or mountains, which start eroding instead (depositingthe sediments in seas / lakes... You get it). As those rocks erode, we can find fossils hidden in them."
explainlikeimfive,"Eli5: Why/how did a basically skull fracture kill Dale Earnhardt Sr, and how would a HANS device saved his life?","Earnhardt's helmet hit a roll cage cross member over 7 inches from his head. His neck stretched something like being hanged with a noose. His neck stretched and caused a basal skull fracture from being thrust forward by the weight of his head and helmet. He was likely dead before the car stopped. 



A HANS device is a composite harness that wraps around your back and shoulders, up the back of your head. There are tethers between the portion behind your head that connect to your helmet. To be blunt, the HANS device keeps your head close to your body, and prevents your neck from getting stretched like an accordion. 

With a HANS device, drivers are now recorded to have survived 100g+ impacts.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why is ° (degree) put before Farenheit and Celsius but not before Kelvin?,"It's because kelvin is a unit but the others are degrees.

A degree is a change in temperature that is measured against a scale (two most well known are Celsius and Fahrenheit scales). A change in degrees on either scale just means that the temperature changed, but doesn't say much about the actual energy for it.

But to be a unit, it must satisfy two criteria: at zero units, there is none; and when the unit is doubled, it needs to be twice as much of whatever is being measured. With kelvin, you are measuring heat through the energy contained in a molecule. At 0K, aka absolute zero, there is no energy. And if you were to go from 100K to 200K, the thermal energy is doubled.

Also it used to be referred to as ""degrees Kelvin,"" but was changed in the mid-to-late 1960s to just ""kelvins"" (lowercase and plural of more than one)."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: The use of the Greek alphabet in US colleges,"Back in the day, classical studies, that is, Greek and Latin language and literature, were a much bigger deal at American universities. The academic clubs that eventually evolved into fraternities leaned on that classical curriculum and chose mottos in Greek to name their organization. Originally, the letters were abbreviations for those mottos, and the full motto was kept a secret from non-members. Today, the letters don't necessarily mean anything but have become part of the aesthetic of college Greek life."
explainlikeimfive,eli5 why are manhole covers in the middle of the road and not on the sidewalk?,"Because they are used to access utilities like sewers or gas lines, and those are located in the middle of the road.

They aren’t ALWAYS in the middle of the road, sometimes they might be under the sidewalk. But a lot of the time they are in the middle of the road because this keeps them an equal distance from the houses on each side of the road which all need to use those utilities. Also, these are publicly owned services which city workers may need to access or even dig up for repairs. It is best if they don’t need to go onto or damage people’s private property to do this, and a sewer under a sidewalk for example would either be very close or actually overlap with people’s buildings or front yards."
explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: why sleeping make us recover faster from illness? Does ""force sleeping"" (pills) have the same effect?","We have no pills that force you to sleep — we’ve only diversified our portfolio of ways to give your brain increasingly impolite suggestions that it ought to go to sleep immediately. All of them are merely ways of encouraging that transition into the regular state of sleep (though many of them can decrease the quality of that sleep, for sure — both antihistamines and THC, the active component in cannabis, are good at persuading you to sleep, but not so good for favorable sleep brainwaves).

As for why sleeping is good for sickness — when you’re awake, your body is doing all sorts of stuff to keep you alive, conscious, and aware of your environment. It is also digesting your food, moving your muscles, etc. — all kinds of stuff, in addition to fighting an infection if you have one. When you’re asleep, the body has a lot less stuff to do at once, and energy is more efficiently directed towards fighting off infections. It’s also less likely that energy is diverted away from immune processes and toward digesting chicken noodle soup, for example."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: what is fiberglass and why is it so dangerous?,"In this case, you can think of it as a cotton candy type material made of super fine glass shards.

Due to said glass shards it gives you tiny cuts on your skin if you touch it which can cause a rash/blisters, and can cause lung damage if you inhale it. It will also irritate your eyes if they are exposed to it. Inside of a mattress, fiberglass is used as a flame retardant. It's there to slow the process of the mattress catching fire if it were to start burning, as it melts and forms a sort of ""barrier"" to protect the flammable insides of the mattress. This layer is going to usually be located in the inner mattress cover, which you are never supposed to remove as the fiberglass will get everywhere. It is extremely difficult to remove from carpet/clothes/furniture and can even enter your HVAC system."

Watching someone else play the game on YouTube isn't the same sort of experience as playing it yourself. And that you might see someone play that game and decide to buy it and play it yourself as a result.

However, listening to a song on YouTube or watching a movie on YouTube is an actual substitute for buying the song or the movie. You aren't very likely to go and buy the movie on Blu-ray after watching it for free on YouTube. So the companies who own those media want to make sure they aren't being streamed on YouTube without their permission."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why can’t we artificially rebuild the ozone layer?,"There are multiple answers to this question. First is that the ozone layer doesn't really have anything to do with global warming. The ozone layer helped to block UV light from the sun reaching the surface which can contribute to higher rates of skin cancer. It doesn't really cause climate change.

Furthermore the hole in the ozone layer has pretty much been solved with the Montreal Protocol, stopping growing in the year 2000 and gradually getting better.

""Rebuilding"" the ozone layer isn't really practical because ozone is generated in the upper atmosphere and only lasts between 30 minutes and 4 hours. Ozone is very reactive and is in a constant balance of being generated and decaying. We can't just pump some ozone up there and call it solved, instead the chemicals that caused it to break down too quickly need to stop being generated and released. Which we did, with the Montreal Protocol."

2. You will need a Business Plan to present to the government agency to show what other services such as investment management or loans or credit cards, etc you will be offering to make you an ongoing and sustainable business.

3. You then fill out several applications that will require more back-up paperwork than will fit in a small truck.  This application goes to the Federal Reserve, who will go over it with a fine-toothed comb because they don't just let anyone have a bank, because otherwise rich bad people would do bad rich people things with it.

4. Anywhere from 18 months to 10 years later, you may be approved to open a new bank."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 how do endangered species deal with inbreeding?,"They don't, really. Having a sharp fall in the population can reduce genetic diversity in a way that impacts descendants, even if numbers later recover, because there just weren't many individual ancestors. Endangered species may be stuck with inbreeding.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population\_bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck)

However, some inbreeding isn't the end of the world in terms of evolutionary fitness, and while too much inbreeding can have negative impacts on a population ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding\_depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding_depression)) it's not always a huge problem. Inbred populations of animals happen worldwide. Think about purebred dogs, which are highly inbred and do routinely suffer from specific genetic problems, yet are overall still pretty capable.

From a natural selection point of view, dying without passing on genes is a guaranteed loss, while inbreeding is a likely win with modest risk."

Heat is energy, and if the *average* temperature of the Earth goes up by 2° F, that's an *enormous* amount of energy added to the Earth's atmosphere. In addition to that, the really concerning thing is, like you mentioned, the rate at which that increase is happening, because it bodes very poorly for the future if it keeps going. 100 years is a drop of water in a lake compared to how long these temperature fluctuations usually take.

The chlorine breaks down when it disinfects, but otherwise has a healthy half life in clean water.  The residual chlorine helps keep the water safe while in the system, although it will eventually break down if the water isn't used.  This is one reason you should let a faucet that hasn't been used in a long time (days/weeks) run a little bit before drinking it.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Can objects get colder than the ambient temperature around them?,"Things can *definitely* cool past ambient temp, with strings attached. The manner in which heat is lost plays the key role, and the item will not stay cooler once the process stops.


One way (in open air) uses water as a mediator. Dry warm air pulls water off of warm thing - and some of the heat with it. We used this out in Afghanistan to cool our water and whatever else. Put drinks in socks, tie to something (preferably a vehicle) wet sock down, move around. After about a 10min drive our 130°f water was actually *cold* and it took maybe ¼ bottle of water to sufficiently cool.


Another way (relevant link below) is by converting heat to EM radiation (light), infrared, in this case. Our atmosphere captures most of that but there is a band which isn't recaptured by the gasses. Converting heat to this particular wavelength allows it to shoot off into space and be completely lost to the planet (but not the universe).

explainlikeimfive,eli5 Why aren’t women’s clothes sized by measurements like men’?,"Because of the Sears Catalog. 

Originally, dress sizes were meant to correspond to ages. A size 8 dress was meant to fit an 8 year old girl. You could purchase the dress or the pattern and make it at home. This would have been in the first part of the 20th century, when you could buy a whole-ass house from the Sears Catalog. 

For next several decades, vanity sizing changed how dresses, and thus women's clothes, were designed, made, and marketed. That is, if a woman is normally a size 12, but you create a 'size 10' dress that fits her, she feels flattered and buys the dress. 

Around the 1970s, the pattern companies gave up keeping pace with changing sizes, which is why a woman's dress pattern size is about 4 sizes bigger than her off the rack dress size. 

Nowadays the best fashion advice for women is to buy a garment that fits the widest part of whatever it's supposed to fit (bust, hips, &tc), then tailor the rest."

Zero, you just spin around in place once every 24 hours.

1000mph, you have to circumnavigate the earth in a day.

This difference doesn’t matter much when you throw a baseball, but it absolutely matters when you’re a storm the size of a country.  This disparity in relative speed rotates the storm since the equatorial side is moving faster than the polar side, and it provides the swirling structure of the hurricane.

But here’s the problem - storms in the north spin counter-clockwise and storms in the south spin clockwise.

That means to cross the equator you have to stop and reverse direction.  That’s not happening, and hurricanes never track near the equator because neither the storm itself nor the prevailing winds that push it around can approach this reversal boundary."

[This](https://www.cacklehatchery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red-jungle-fowl-scaled.jpg) is what wild junglefowl chicks look like. 

The bright yellow colors you are familiar with are the result of artificial selection by humans.  People like domestic animals with unusual colors and often selectively breed for those colors.  This has resulted in  a wide variety of ducks and chickens which differ in color from their wild relatives.  Since the same genetic mechanisms tend to control color in adults and offspring, this changes the color of the chicks, too.  And because they are protected from predators, they don't need to be camouflaged.  

Here's a [chart](https://survivalexicon.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/standard-breeds-chart1.jpg) showing various chicken breeds along with their chicks.  Note that the bright yellow chicks come from the white breeds...neither the adults nor the offspring have dark coloration.  And also notes that lots of domestic chickens do have dark colors...they just aren't featured in photos as much.  

Ducks are very similar, I just couldn't find a chart showing adults next to offspring."

Just talking about your problems could make you feel better. Not everyone has a friend they can talk to about everything.

Or a therapist might teach you different ways of thinking about your problems. Maybe you have an internal monologue telling yourself something like, ""This is hopeless. I'm useless. I don't deserve to succeed."" They can help you balance out these extreme thoughts.

Or a therapist could help you by working with you to create a plan to improve your life through being more active - training yourself to exercise more, interact with other people more, try more new things."
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why can't certain organs such as the pancreas or brain be transplanted? (what other organs cannot be transplanted?),"It is possible to do a pancreas transplant, but it's indicated only in people who have also a kidney failure, therefore it's a double transplant, kidney and pancreas. 

Keep in mind that when you receive a transplant of any kind you'll have to do a immunosuppressive treatment for the rest of your life. It's far more easy and safe to use insulin and enzymes for the rest of your life!"
explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why did people only use one hand when firing pistols up until the 20th century.,"Ooh I know this one :P Smoothbore pistols were notoriously inaccurate. Using two hands would ensure better aiming accuracy, but it wouldn't matter much if the bullet flies off the true aim anyway. Duelists found it better to stand side-on to the target, reducing their own target cross-section and improving their chances of survival. This is likewise why the old style of firing rifles survived so long. Nowadays it's discouraged to fire long guns ""chicken-wing"" style, rather than keeping your elbow down and squaring up to the target, especially presuming you're wearing a ballistic vest.

As for why gunmen continued to shoot one-handed after accurate guns came about, at least as far as revolvers go, you can't put your second hand high up on the frame because flames come out of the cylinder and would burn you. This is where the ""teacup"" grip came from, with the second hand supporting the shooting hand. I don't think it was considerably more effective than shooting one-handed though, especially in a close-range fight.

Now with magazine-fed pistols, we have the option of an effective two-handed grip."

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: What do electrolytes and sodium have to do with hydration? Is water alone not enough?,"You need two things: blood volume and blood saltiness. 

If your blood saltiness goes outside of a fairly narrow range, very bad things happen to you. 

If your blood is not salty enough (often because you've sweated a ton), your kidneys will dump water out of your blood, to bring the salt concentration back up. 

However, this can end up lowering the total *volume* of blood in your body down below optimal levels, making you feel thirsty.  

So you drink more water, and pee it right back out again because yikes not salty enough. 

And because your kidneys aren't perfect machines, they always leak *some* salt into your urine, reducing your total salt level even more. 

Rinse (out) and repeat. 

This is no fun for anyone involved. 

In order to fix it, you need to consume some salt (and optionally some other salt-like chemicals) so your kidneys will let you hold onto the water you take in. 

If you take in too much salt, it's less of an issue, as you can just guzzle water to dilute yourself, and your kidneys will gradually let the excess volume out along with some of the salt. It takes longer but it gets there without too much intervention."
explainlikeimfive,Eli5: How do people who are homeless vote in the US?

So even if you do not have a permanent home yourself there are plenty of ways of getting an address that can receive mail. And that is enough of a residence to register to vote.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Why can’t Everest casualties just be lowered down? What makes it so difficult?,"A good sized chunk of Everest is in the ""Death Zone"", an altitude above which no one can survive indefinitely.  The air is so thin that the moment you cross that line, you're slowly suffocating to death.  

In that kind of thin air EVERYTHING that you do burns an incredible amount of energy.  Pick up a 5lbs weight and pack it a hundred feet, and you'll feel like you carried a 100lbs weight half a mile at sea level.  

Add into this temperatures that rarely rise into positive digits, slippery/unstable ground under your feet, and walking paths a couple of feet wide with drop-offs that are thousands of feet on both sides, and it's all that you can do just to carry your own body up the mountain.  

If someone is critically injured on the mountain, sherpa's (local people whose bodies are acclimated to the environment and can at least perform much better than your average person) might risk their lives to carry you down, but depending on the conditions may have to abandon you simply because it would be suicide to try and get you down.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5 How does grounding work,"sorry, there are some attempts to describe grounding, each one good to some degree, in the end too complex, missing the ELI5 point. 

I'm neither physicist nor electrician (nor native english speaker), let me have an attempt, please downvote if wrong!

(i'm gonna repeat things that others said because they are correct)


The Earth works like a big dumpster for charge. It has basically zero charge, and because it is so big and massive, you can put basically endless charge into the earth, without changing the ""zero charge"" noticeably. 

(probably not true from an advanced physicist's pov, i'd be interested to learn more. But enough to explain our earthly problems.) 

So the Earth is a massive Zero charge ball.

Electricity works in a way, that if there is higher charge at any point and lower charge at any other point, and if there is a connection between those two points, the higher charge immediately flows towards the lower charge point until they both are equal.

If you touch a power cable (the positive, charged line of a power cable), and you stand with your feet on the ground, you become the connection between the point of high charge (cable) and low charge (earth, massive zero charge ball), therefore the electricity will flow through you to the earth.

(the following is probably not true for other electrical proportions, but in our example of a massive power grid with huge powerplants vs. a human touching cable and earth:)

without any security measures (fuses and such) the source of power (the power plant) does not care, if the power that flows, comes back to it or if the power flows into the earth. it is like an open water pipe, it doesn't care if you hit the bucket or if you spill everything on the floor, it just keeps pushing. 

(this is why an GFCI-switch is important: it notices that the electricity is not flowing back to the source (difference between out and in), but goes somewhere else (the earth) and shuts off!)

And now, finally, what does the grounding do? the grounding is a third path for the electricity. (first path: from power plant to where it is needed (for example washing machine), second path: from where it is needed back home to the power plant)

the third path, the grounding, is a path from the place where electricity is needed (washing machine) to the ground / earth (massive zero charge ball).

Because: if any malfunction happens inside of your washing machine and something inside or the second path back to the power plant is broken, the power plant still pushes electricity into the washing machine (because the power plant doesn't care), but it cannot flow back, so the electricity waits there.

if you now touch your washing machine (outside metal cover/parts), you become the connection between the high charged point and the earth, so you will be shocked by the washing machine.

the third path - the grounding, connects the metal parts of any device like your washing machine with the ground so that when an malfunction happens, the electricity flows right into the ground and does not wait there until you touch the machine and get shocked."
explainlikeimfive,"eli5, what is in our spit that can break oil apart?","Saliva contains enzymes like amylase and lipase. These enzymes act a lot like soap.

explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does a relatively small amount of chromium prevent steel from rusting?,"Because it rusts instead.

Stainless steel is about 10% chromium. And when exposed to the air the chromium reacts with the oxygen much faster.

This forms a layer of chromium oxide on the surface. And that layer of chromium oxide stops any more oxygen from reaching the steel (specifically the iron atoms). And since the oxygen can’t reach the iron, it cannot rust."
