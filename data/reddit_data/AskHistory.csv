AskHistorians,Could people do backflips/front flips in ancient times?,"Some of the earliest images of people doing flips that I can think of come from the [Minoan bull leaping fresco](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Bull_leaping_minoan_fresco_archmus_Heraklion_%28cropped%29.jpg/1200px-Bull_leaping_minoan_fresco_archmus_Heraklion_%28cropped%29.jpg), dated to 1400 BCE from the Mediterranean island of Crete. It shows one person grabbing the horns of the bull, possibly in preparation to jump, a second person flipping over the bull's back, and a third person possibly landing on their toes with arms out behind the bull.

This fairly famous piece of ancient art is interpreted as showing a ritual or event (we're not sure if it's religious, entertainment, both, etc.) where people jumped over the horns of a bull and did a flip over its back before landing behind it. Bulls were a pretty important symbol in Minoan society (you've heard of the Mino-taur, right?), and that leads us to think that the event might have had some social or ritual significance, rather than just being for fun.

What makes this more than a weird one-off piece of art? Well, we have other archaeological material that depicts Minoan bull-leaping in other forms, like [little figurines](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1966-0328-1). They show up in various contexts at sites around Crete, which allows us to say that bull-leaping was perhaps a regular event in Minoan society at some level, worth depicting in a variety of forms.

Now, speaking as an anthropologist, we might extrapolate a little bit. If people are successfully flipping over the horns of a bull on a regular basis in 1400 BCE, then it stands to reason that people more generally had been able to do flips for considerably longer than that - you wouldn't just start out with the flip over the horns of the bull, after all, you would need to work your way up to it. And if people were going to the trouble of depicting bull-leaping in palace frescoes, miniature figurines, and so on, all over the island, then it must have been important to them in some way; or, as you put it, they thought it was cool.

AskHistorians,"How did the USA go from robust trade unions, a 94% tax rate on the wealthiest, and toasting with the Soviets on VJ Day to union busting, a 30% tax rate on the wealthiest, and CIA backed military juntas in Latin America in less than 30 years?","Unfortunately on taxation rates, the presumptions in your question are a classic case of correlation without causation.  So let's start with this: outside of their initial implementation in World War I, you know who raised the top tax bracket in percentage terms more than anyone else in history?  

It was that notorious socialist, Herbert Hoover.  This was because his single financial goal during the Great Depression was to keep the federal budget balanced, something that would leave even the most conservative modern economists of today a little bewildered.  The Revenue Act of 1932 is one of the more boneheaded economic measures in American history - it almost certainly deepened the crisis especially with excise taxes raising prices on basic goods for low income earners while there's deflation elsewhere, including their wages - but that's why the top tax bracket goes up from 25% in 1931 to 63% in 1932, even if its reach was limited as only 1/16th of American households paid any income tax at that time.

FDR's taxation policies are a bit arcane largely because they bounce around quite a bit; he doesn't fully buy into Keynesian stuff despite running slight deficits for some of the New Deal and periodically tinkers with policies that inject a very limited bit of liquidity without breaking the budget, like the Bonus Bill that passes over his objections.  By 1936, he's more focused on a politically popular attempt to capture tax evasion among the very wealthy who are not paying anywhere close to the 63% top rate; this is very popular with many conservative Southern Democrats who by this point are starting to oppose almost everything else he's doing domestically, but as one puts it, ""I am told that Andrew Mellon has an income of $30 million a year. If I had my way we would put a [Purple Heart] on his purse big enough to be seen from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.”  This results in the top personal tax rate going up to 79%; when FDR starts getting data in that they're still dodging most taxes and provides Congress with it, the popularity of going after them is reflected in the 1937 Revenue Act which raises corporate taxes from 15% to 19% and remarkably passes Congress without a single dissenting vote.

Tax policy changes with World War II, but for reasons that aren't obvious on the surface. The single greatest factor in them is a generally bipartisan concern that ""war profiteering"" be ruthlessly taxed.  This stemmed from the aftermath of World War I where the Nye Committee leaves many Americans with the impression that the United States' entry into the war was driven primarily by profit rather than principle, and is a major factor in creating the near-disastrous Neutrality Acts in the mid 1930s that later almost cripple FDR's attempts to aid Britain.  

That concern also extends to profits, which taxation policy shifts to accommodate - essentially, it can be summed up in FDR's later comment in 1942 that ""In this time of grave national danger, when all excess income should go to win the war, no American citizen ought to have a net income after he has paid his taxes of more than $25,000.""  This number isn't agreed to by many even though it leads to the eventual top rate of 94% in 1944, but it does reflect the general consensus on taxation policy leading up to America's entry into the war: this time, no one is supposed to get rich off of it.

It gets a bit complicated, but varying measures to do so are deeply tied up politically with the isolation movement along with the draft bill; some of the compromises that FDR makes to loosen them slightly are directly correlated with votes on things like attempting to target excess profits by either fixing rates of return in industries that might profit from the war, or later just outright taxing them at rates over 90%.  You can make an argument that the graduated tax structure is less progressive than Roosevelt keeping a national sales tax out of the whole formula of revenue, something he has opposed since taking office.

The postwar rates stay up largely because there is also bipartisan agreement after the war that some of the debt racked up needs to be paid down.  This switches from debt to funding when the Korean War begins; in 1950, there's another revenue act, and after it becomes clear that the war is not going to end any time soon an excess profit tax act is added on.  This made Korea unique as just about the only war that the United States has ever fought which was largely paid for by taxation during it; most others have had a breakdown of roughly about 20% support from taxation and 80% debt.  Many of the special revenue measures expired after the armistice, but Eisenhower fought (and succeeded) in keeping the 90% top tax rate for a reason that had absolutely nothing to do with progressivism and almost everything to do with the same goals as Hoover: more than anything else, [he wanted to balance the budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u8lpmx/if_dwight_eisenhower_felt_the_militaryindustrial/i5ntz1q/).  

One component of Kennedy's administration is to finally lower that top tax bracket.  He succeeds to an extent, but it's really LBJ who begins substantially lowering income tax rates, especially those at the top of the pyramid - the details of which Robert Caro explains thoroughly in *The Passage of Power*, as it required exquisitely timed legislative maneuvering (LBJ went so far as to personally order the Government Printing Office to stay open on a weekend to potentially print the bill, for instance) to not get the tax cut bill stuck behind a filibuster of the Civil Rights Act, which would have killed both.  This is what drops the top bracket from 91% to eventually 70% throughout the 1960s and 1970s, where it stays until Reagan's first budget (50%) and then his second grand compromise with Dan Rostenkowski in 1987 (38.5%).  Reagan's motivation in doing so are a different, top level topic, but all this should at least give you an idea that the top tax bracket of the United States in the 20th Century often had little to do with redistribution of wealth."
AskHistorians,What pop history book has done the most damage to the study of your particular subfield?,"""The Gangs of New York"" is a very entertaining read, and a good way for a new reader to get interested in Nineteenth Century New York City history. Unfortunately it is also largely a work of fiction.

Herbert Asbury was wrong about Theodore Allen disappearing after being accused of murder in the 1870's (he remained a public figure, written about regularly in periodicals until his death in 1908). Asbury failed to realize that the mythologized Bowery Boy, ""Mose,"" was actually the main character in a popular series of Bowery theater plays. He wrote extensively of a ""gang"" called the Daybreak boys, which never existed and is never once mentioned in contemporary periodicals. 

Asbury arbitrarily divided nearly everyone in blue collar NYC into ""gangs"" and aligned politicians and public figures like John Morrisey and William Poole with these criminal ""gangs"" without evidence or clear rationale. As Tyler Anbinder first noticed, Asbury misunderstood the derogatory nickname of ""Dead Rabbits"" as used by members of the Atlantic Guards (actually a state militia company, not a gang) and invented an imaginary Five Points gang by that name. 

He mislabelled Bowery Boys, members of a subculture like hippies or punks, as a ""gang.""

Asbury provided no footnotes and little detail as to what his research methods were. But it is difficult to believe that he could have been very thorough in his work -- The Gangs of New York was one of five books which he would publish in 1928.

The wreckage in the wake of this book has been horrible. It has been cited so many times without question that dozens, perhaps hundreds, of other books which have cited it in the last 94 years are now in turn cited independently as sources for 19th century NYC historical information. At a glance it looks as though there is a mountain of evidence for this fictional version of history, when in fact it all teeters on one man's imagination and sloppy work."
AskHistorians,How would a professional historian look for the One Ring?,"# Gandalf’s Reference Desk Query

A little refresher. Having seen Bilbo’s Ring, Gandalf immediately suspected it was the One Ring. He had previously been assured by Saruman that the Ring was lost forever and went into the ocean. The only historical figure associated with the Ring, besides Sauron, was Prince Isildur of Gondor, whose story appeared at the beginning of the first movie. No one else had ever reported seeing it for themselves, and about 3000 years had passed. So, Gandalf went to Gondor.

> In former days the members of my order had been well received there, but Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of the City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.
> 
> ""If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, and the beginnings of the City, read on!"" he said. ""For to me what was is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this City.""
> 
> So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can read, even of the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.

From this we may understand that Minas Tirith did not have an archivist, and the scrolls of the city had not been properly categorized. However, Denethor, Steward of Gondor, informed Gandalf that Saruman had already been through the papers. Presumably, this made Gandalf suspicious and encouraged him to look closely at everything. (It’s not clear to me how Saruman was so sure he could gain useful information from ancient archives. Saruman sounds a bit like one of Lovecraft's occult antiquarians.)

These were unsorted papers written in ancient languages. So basically, Gandalf had to go through them all, ensuring he was able to read every page in every language, until he recognized one that had been written by or about Isildur. Gandalf reported that the [Scroll of Isildur](http://www.henneth-annun.net/things_view.cfm?thid=178) had probably not been read by anyone but him and Saruman. It sounds like it must have taken a lot of work and knowledge to find this in an unsorted pile written in multiple ancient languages. In Tolkien's time philologists would have jumped at such a challenge, but today historians are lucky if we can accomplish such a thing even for our PhD dissertations.

# 10th-17th century archival tools

Denethor reasonably explains to Gandalf that he didn’t have time to waste on old documents, as was probably the case with many medieval secular authorities. But what if his regime placed importance on old things, or if the texts had some kind of religious importance? He would have to assemble a team of philologists able to recognize what each document was about. Then he could simply make a list of every title he owned, as in medieval and early modern bibliographies. (Early modern European libraries numbered their lists, but Arabic and East Asian libraries did not.) This would make it easier for Gandalf as he could simply read through a single list; I guess a large one, since the library was quite ancient, but still better than having to look at each page. However, such lists are sometimes incomplete, and Gandalf might have to go to the stacks eventually if he didn’t find what he was looking for.

# 18th-20th century archival tools

You asked what a “professional historian” would do to find the Scroll of Isildur, and we are living in the 21st century now. It is rare that we have to look through handwritten lists of documents anymore. If there was a high demand to see the catalog, for instance a *renaissance* of antiquarian fascination in Gondor, some work would be put in to make more rational categories sorted by subject matter or author’s name. Such rationalized catalogs might also be distributed to other areas: maybe Denethor wanted to share his archival information with his brethren in Arnor, or with his branch libraries in local fiefs. Historians do use these print catalogs still, if they have not been digitized yet. If we stumble upon a brand new pile of very important papers (which I have done once before), it is often our first instinct to sort them and catalog them, before we do any actual research. I suppose if we were worried about the possibility that the One Ring had appeared in the Shire, we might skip this step, but such urgency is rare in our profession.

If Denethor had a lot of new manuscripts coming in — perhaps Orcish “movable type” is taking off in Gondor — he might want to make a card catalog, which would allow him to make frequent updates to his complete catalog while keeping everything sorted by author, title or subject. This would require him to hire full time library staff to ensure that the catalog was correctly matching all the new titles, which could conceivably put a strain on the limited financial resources of Gondor. Anyway, either of these systems would make it extremely easy to find the Scroll of Isildur.

# 21st century archival tools

To get really silly, a lot of historical research these days is done with metadata and digitized documents.  Besides the obvious technological hurdles to getting the library online, given the diversity of Gondor's collection we would also need some software engineers and digital humanities experts, so that we could OCR the Scroll of Isildur and make the full text accessible to search engines. But just think, if Denethor had done this, Gandalf wouldn’t have had to travel to Minas Tirith at all. He could sit in the Hobbiton public library and type in the word “Isildur” in the Minas Tirith system, and most likely the scroll would pop up, assuming that the bibliographer had entered the metadata correctly. This seems to me like the most reasonable way that Gandalf would have gotten his hands on some forgotten 3000-year-old lore, if he were a 21st century historian (I am avoiding the counterfactual route of immortal elves remembering their time with Isildur).

This would have certainly removed a lot of the tension from the story, not just because Gandalf would have popped off down the street to the library, but also because Frodo would be long gone by the time the Black Riders arrived (or the Black Riders would have had to have been much speedier and less mysterious). One of many reasons why we can say Tolkien makes great use of his medieval setting."
AskHistorians,The aftermath of Kanye West’s antisemitic rhetoric has again sparked debate that Black Americans are the original Israelites/Hebrews. Why is this myth still so prevalent within the Black community?,"Black Hebrew mythology originates from the same place as Black Jewish synagogues, which furthermore is not terribly different from black perspectives on Islam. All of these groups came to prominence in the first decades of the twentieth century, with the Muslims organized into the Nation of Islam a few decades later. Black Americans emerged from slavery, where they were often given a purposefully censored view of Christianity by their enslavers, combined with analogies spread amongst themselves to the sacred history of Moses leading the Jews to freedom. Excluded from white churches and seminaries, they often saw the white Christian establishment as having created an institutional hypocrisy, and sought out alternative ways of defining themselves as an ethnic-national group.

Because Jim Crow racial norms held that black people were a separate nation “from Africa” in an otherwise European continent, Jews were an easy reference point, considering how they admitted to non-European origins. As whites drew legal boundaries to prevent blacks from intermarrying or participating in civic life, the success of the Jews despite self-imposed racial boundaries was again an easy reference point. Blacks who attempted to implement Judaism for themselves were accused of mimicry and fraud by ethnic Jewish rabbis, which immediately led to the rhetoric you probably heard from Ye/Kanye West or Kyrie Irving this week:

> The assertion that Judaism was uniquely suited to black people went hand in hand with the claim by some black Jews that Jews of European ancestry were in fact frauds or ""interlopers:' Prophet Cherry, for example, often quoted Revelation 3:9 (""Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and learn that I have loved you"") in support of his belief that white Jews were religious impostors. Rabbi Arnold Ford taught that the ""real"" Jews were black people, while Jews of European descent were said to be ""offshoots"" of the original lineage of black Jews or converts who had received the religion secondhand from Africans. 

However, these quotes are from 100 years ago and were spoken by (self-appointed) black rabbis! You can see [a 1923 photo of a Black Jewish women’s choir](https://works.swarthmore.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context=fac-religion#page=9) in the article I am quoting this from. As that article notes, this is very similar to the Nation of Islam “Yakub” mythology of the 1960s in its provocative intent.

Some Black Americans converted all the way to practicing Judaism and continue to practice it today. The Jewish community has grown much more understanding of Black Judaism over the decades, which has led to racial integration from the ethnic Jewish side and better understanding of Jewish historical orthodoxy on the Black Jewish side, although relations remain awkward sometimes (you can see discussions on this on Jewish news sites). You also mentioned the Nation of Islam, which underwent a similar process; the group began when Americans in general had a poor understanding of Islam, so it used Muslim and Jewish symbols freely, but now the original branches of that group promote orthodox Islam and dialogue with Judaism. 

Outside these groups, though, rhetoric about an African Israel continued to mix with other beliefs about African identity and racial unity. This rhetoric is often eclectic, meaning there is no institutional organization to it, and no one person who propagates this kind of mythology; it circulates in in-person lectures and in self-published books, and academic research about it is similarly scattershot. Unfortunately, although Black Hebrew mythology originated as a legitimating device for black expression of Judaism, after being divorced from its initial context for decades and appropriated by wholly different groups with different motives, it has now become a flimsy justification for hateful antisemitic remarks."
AskHistorians,"In Scottish law, a person can be found ""guilty"", ""not guilty"", but also ""not proven"", which I've heard half-jokingly called ""not guilty and don't do it again"". What are the origins of the ""not proven"" verdict in Scottish law?","""the jury gave that bastard verdict, ***not proven***"" - Sir Walter Scott

Not a historian - though I am a Scots law student - so couldn't quite resist talking about the boogeyman of our justice system.

The earliest Scots juries would return a verdict of ""guilty"" or ""innocent"", broadly speaking (the language use was not consistent). This was the case until around the time of the Restoration (late 17th c.-early 18th c.), where juries began returning ""special verdicts"" of ""proven"" or ""not proven"" for matters of fact, and the judge would be the one to ultimately convict/acquit. 

The reason for this was down to some combination of juries becoming confused by what they should infer in certain cases (one academic gives the acquittal of a suspected child murder as the potential catalyst), and the refusal of juries to convict due to perceived unfairness/persecution of certain religious groups (it was the time of the Restoration, after all).

This remained the case until 1726 when a jury returned a verdict of not guilty with little attention amidst a general increase in the power of juries. Two years later in 1728, a particularly fervent defence advocate appealed for a ""not guilty"" verdict for his client to the jury, accompanied by a lengthy speech about the jury's inalienable rights, etc. This eliminated any question of the jury's competency to convict/acquit and led to a general return of the guilty/not guilty verdicts. 

The ""special verdicts"", their purpose now obsolete, fell into obscurity. But ""not proven"" was still occasionally returned through the late 18th and 19th centuries - particularly in cases where the jury was suspicious, but felt there was not enough evidence to convict the accused - especially in the cases where capital punishment was still a valid sentence. 

Moving into the 20th century and to the modern day, the purpose of ""not proven"" was further questioned, owing to the abolishment of capital punishment and the direction that it was, for all intents and purposes, a simple acquittal. Notably - it was grouped with ""not guilty"" in cases of a majority verdict - assuming a full jury of 15, there must be 8 votes for a guilty verdict to be returned, otherwise, an acquittal occurs. In essence - the ""not proven"" that is returned now is no longer really the same as the original special verdict in the sense of ""this set of facts was not proven"". It's an ill-defined acquittal. 

And that more or less brings us to the verdict's current perception of ""not guilty, but don't do it again!"" (particularly due to its tendency to be returned in cases of rape/sexual assault). ""Not proven"" has survived all manner of judicial critique, jury confusion, and many an attempted law reform... well, except literally today - it was announced that the [verdict would be scrapped.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-65397235)

AskHistorians,"How many men died DIGGING the trenches in ww1? In modern construction, trenching is one of the most deadly tasks, requiring shoring or trench walls.","How many men were killed from digging itself?

From a British Army point of view, it'd be very difficult to attain that figure, given how inextricable the *daily and ongoing* task of digging, improving and repairing trench systems was with the actual tactical task of holding an assigned section of line. Note that I'm completely omitting *tunneling* from this, as a) it's not an area I can provide an answer on, and b) you seemed to be asking more about combat at ground level rather than combat 10 metres underground.

When holding the line and improving the line are viewed to be one and the same thing, the daily reports and returns on casualties from front line units back to Brigade and Divisional staffs inevitably reported enemy action in general terms, then simply listed casualties arising from the day's activities as  part of the fact.

To highlight the point between the non-distinction between the difficulties of digging and also holding the line generally (be it ""on the line"", ""in reserve"" or ""resting""), Richard Holmes quotes a Second Lieutenant Edwin Underhill of his experiences near Ploegsteert Wood near Ypres in 1915 (Underhill would later be promoted and die at Thiepval whilst serving with 8th Battalion Loyal North Lancs during the Battle of the Somme) -

>... I took 150 men to do drainage work under the REs on the communication trenches on the left of where we were before we came out. It was an endless, hopeless task. The walls had caved in in places, and as soon as the muck was cleared out it caved in again, and it all had to be done again.... All the time we were working this morning, shells were bursting every now and then. And they were unpleasantly close too.

Basically put, if you were being shelled, and you were buried whilst digging, casualties were invariably attributed to the enemy shell that either directly (or indirectly by weaking the structure and the soil around it) buried the men doing the digging.

How often were men buried due to trenches being blown in or losing their structural integrity due to incoming artillery?

Often enough that such events litter official and unofficial unit histories of British and Dominion units. The unofficial history of the 11th Battalion AIF, ""Legs Eleven"" by Captain Walter C Belford, refers to either the burying of personnel or the disinterring of corpses by artillery no less than 8 times when describing the experience of the Battalion at one battle alone.

Captain Belford highlights your exact point about just how deadly a volume of earth can be when describing the Battalion's experience at being shelled for the entire day on 24 July 1916.

>This shelling was constant and well directed, with many of these shells landed on the newly dug trenches, making large craters and often burying many of the troops. Some of the boys managed to struggle out, others were rescued by their mates; but many who had dug themselves only too well in were completely buried by the great upheavals of earth.

Putting aside the second type of main trench that the BEF used at the start of the war (the largely above-ground revetments that are less relevant to your question), it's also difficult to ascertain casualty figures for trenches built under the ground level because of the method used to build trenches in most tactical scenarios.

Whilst this isn't by any means the only way a ""line"" was established, two pretty common ways of establishing a trench line were firstly advancing to a point and digging in, with the second being prosecuting an advance and taking over a set of positions or portion of the enemy's line before going through the difficult and brutal process of integrating it into your line and segregating it from the rest of the enemy's line.

In the first method, once a unit was given an order to ""Dig in"", groups of soldiers in 2's and 3's would proceed to dig ""posts"", essentially foxholes to provide immediate cover. Once these were dug, the soldiers would proceed to dig laterally to basically join up posts into a continuous line, which would then be integrated into the existing line via the construction of saps (perpendicular trench lines) and communication trenches. Whilst the unit that is digging in is doing so, other sister units that are ""in reserve"" or assigned as carrying parties that are ""in combat"" (but were not tasked with the direct assault) are bringing up construction materials - revetments, corrugated iron, wooden boards, frames, pickets and barbed wire - anything and everything that would make the new trenchline structurally sound and defensible enough to occupy in the short term as the tactical situation required. If the situation dictated that a given section of the line would be needed on an ongoing basis, there'd be time to reinforce it as part of the regular cycle of units moving in between support, reserve and front line trenches (new or old) as they cycled through a respective tour of the line.

The second method generally involved the capture of enemy posts (or even parts of trench system that were already established), and clearing the enemy of the immediate area around the captured positions (and ensuring that any counter-attacks were beaten off). Once that was done, the exact same process to convert and integrate the new position as the first method can be undertaken (construction and improvement of interconnecting saps and communications trenches) to integrate the new line.

The reality was that integrating a new stretch of line was a pretty significant undertaking (aerial photos of some portions of the western front look more like a chessboard than a two sets of vaguely parallel trench systems), as was maintaining existing trenches which would be intermittently subject to enemy artillery and mortar fire to varying degrees of frequency and impact depending on how active the sector was at the time. It was for this reason that units in ""Rest"" or ""Reserve"" were often doing anything but resting, and were often engaged in backbreaking labour.

In either of those scenarios, the act of digging actually becomes somewhat synonymous with combat or enemy action - under those circumstances it becomes pretty understandable why the distinction of a casualty due ""purely to digging a trench"" doesn't really get much traction, especially when the need to structurally reinforce trenches that needed to be establish beyond a line of outposts (and indeed these looser tactical arrangements were also often used, especially when holding lines ""in-depth"") was already very well understood by planners and commanders from the first months of the war.

In summary

1. How were trenches dug without collapsing on the men digging them?

Basically it became necessary for assault forces to include carrying parties, engineers, and ""troops in reserve"" that would essentially work to deliver the necessary structural reinforcement to the lines as the lines were established or consolidated.

2) Were the casualties from these engineering endeavours significant?

Yes, but unfortunately due to the tactical environment that these construction and maintenance efforts were undertaken in, it's nearly impossible to determine what the casualties were for men who died *just* by the act of digging, mainly because of the often continuous nature of the combat occurring around them whilst they dug. Certainly I've never seen British or Dominion sources make the distinction.

3) What about the Tunneling Companies Mr NotAWittyFucker? They did a lot of Digging!

They sure did, Billy. Seriously, that's a subject worthy of it's own post, and one I'm regrettably not as familiar with or have resources to provide an authoritative answer. I'll let someone else answer that one if you're interested."
AskHistorians,Why did magazines like Playboy and Penthouse do such serious journalism?,"_Playboy_ was not launched with interviews. It was launched, as
stated in Volume I, Number I (1953) as a ""magazine for men""
that wasn't just for outdoors activities, as the ones that existed
at the time tended to be.

>We like our apartment. We enjoy mixing up cocktails and an hors
d'oeuvre or two, putting a little mood music on the phonograph,
and inviting in a female acquaintance for a quiet discussion
on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex.

The closest magazine as precedent was _Esquire_, founded in 1933,
which Hefner worked for right before founding _Playboy_. _Esquire_ tried
to form a sophisitcated urbanite image, although without the
nudity. As Hefner wrote to a marketing consultant:

>What we seem to have is the _Esquire_ man, but we've got him
ten years younger.

Where the interviews entered in was in an entirely different publication:
_Show Business Illustrated_, also as published by Hefner. That magazine
was much shorter lived, [only lasting to 12 issues](https://www.abebooks.com/magazines-periodicals/Show-Business-Illustrated-aka-SBI-complete/30868969071/bd)
going from September 1961 to April 1962. It was intended
to evoke the _Playboy_ feel without the nudity (although there was a
""Show Business Beauty"" feature) and focused purely on the arts, accompanied
some deep features and interviews.

One of the late intended features was with Alex Haley (of _Roots_ fame) doing
a story about the jazz musician Miles Davis. Davis was famous for
not giving interviews, but due to Haley's persistence (and being black)
he was willing to spend the day together.

Unfortunately, this was right when the _Show Business_ magazine collapsed,
so the feature was never able to run. However, at the time,
A. C. Spectrorsky (the editorial director for _Playboy_) was interested
in increasing the level of seriousness of the magazine; while there
was always a notion of printing real stories and the like (notice the
references to Picasso and Nietzsche in the first issue) it was still
culturally considered ""just"" a magazine for the nudes at the time.

With the interview publication falling through, _Playboy_ seemed like the
right place, and hence, they got their very first, [which you can

>DAVIS: I know damn well a lot of it is race. White people have certain things they expect from Negro musicians -- just like they've got labels for the whole Negro race. It goes clear back to the slavery days. That was when Uncle Tomming got started because white people demanded it. Every little black child grew up seeing that getting along with white people meant grinning and acting clowns. It helped white people to feel easy about what they had done, and were doing, to Negroes, and that's carried right on over to now. You bring it down to musicians, they want you to not only play your instrument, but to entertain them, too, with grinning and dancing.

Haley's interviews for _Playboy_ continued, with very famous ones with
Malcolm X in May of 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr. in January of 1965.

This was right when Hefner was also more concerned about being socially conscious; he
always considered himself progressive, and had faced some charges of racism
in the publication. The _Los Angeles Sentinel_ pointed out a lack of
black representation amongst the _Playboy_ definition of beauty.
Hefner responded:

>Anyone who can afford to join our club is welcome to do so. I am the symbol of the swingingest, the heppest cat around ... Yet I have very strong beliefs in the equality of men. Just as the pipe I smoke becomes a part of the image, so will my deep convictions about human rights.

While clearly there was some colorism going on, by April 1963 _Playboy_ had
a feature on ""The Girls of Africa"" and later featured the African-American
Jennifer Jackson as a Playmate.

There was enough positive response to the interviews that later issues kept this thread of seriousness going all the way through the Cold War. In the 80s this included quite a few interviews with Central American
leaders; the historian and media theorist Laura Saarenmaa suggests that _Playboy_'s position as
a counterculture outlet gave it more leeway when it came to questioning
the status quo. Their connection as still being in essence a ""girlie mag"" may have also helped. For example, there was one writer (Claudia Dreifus) who was
in Nicaragua in 1983, and when questioned about it, she responded
she was doing an article on ""the Girls of Managua"". What actually
came out was a Playboy Interview with The Sandinistas. It was subtitled:

>a candid and lively conversation with nicaragua's marxist leaders about their soviet-cuban connection, reagan's hostility and ""bedtime for bonzo""

One of the interviewees, Ernesto Cardenal Martínez (author of _Zero Hour_, a ""documentary poem"" telling the history of the revolution), said:

>The person responsible for the fact I no longer write poetry is Ronald Reagan. If he had not been elected, perhaps I would be happy and tranquil. He really messed up my personal life.

AskHistorians,"In Lord of the Rings the men often hold hands, kiss each other's brow, express love, cradle another's head on their lap while they sleep... were these behaviors typical of Western men from Tolkien's time? Were men acting this way seen as atypical at the time of publication? What changed?","J.R.R. Tolkien's portrayals of physical affection between male characters in The Lord of the Rings likely stemmed from his experiences serving as a British soldier on the front lines during World War I. As literary scholar Paul Fussell has observed, Great War literature frequently contained homoerotic themes that reflected the deep emotional bonds formed between soldiers in the trenches. Tolkien's own service likely influenced his depictions of intimacy between Frodo, Sam, and other male characters. 

*Edit: I should clarify that Tolkien portrays these relationships as as intensely loyal and affectionate, but does not indicate anything overtly (homo)erotic. The type of love Tolkien describes is platonic, though it reflects the often more overtly quasi-erotic overtones of Great War poetry.*

## Tolkien's War Experiences

As background, Tolkien served as a second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers during the Great War. He fought in the Somme offensive in 1916, where he contracted trench fever and was evacuated home to England. Many of Tolkien's close friends were killed in the war. 

As Tolkien later acknowledged: 

> ""An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience, but the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely complex, and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous."" (The Fellowship of the Ring, Foreword)

Tolkien began writing his earliest Middle-earth stories, including ""The Fall of Gondolin,"" while recovering from illness during the war. The influence of his traumatic experiences on his fiction is hard to deny.

## Homoerotic Themes in Great War Literature

In his seminal study *The Great War and Modern Memory*, Paul Fussell analyzed the extensive homoerotic themes in Great War literature:

> ""No one turning from the poetry of the Second World War to that of the First can fail to notice there the unique physical tenderness, the readiness to admire openly the bodily beauty of young men, the unapologetic recognition that men may be in love with each other.""

Fussell argues these homoerotic motifs reflected the heightened emotional bonds and intimacy that developed between soldiers enduring the horrors of trench warfare together. Their camaraderie and loyalty took on quasi-erotic overtones. As Fussell states, ""in the trenches...the proximity of one man to another was virtually that of lover to lover.""

As a soldier-poet exposed to contemporary war writing, Tolkien would have been keenly aware of these homoerotic themes. Passages like the one where Sam cradles Frodo's head in his lap while he sleeps echo the intimate scenes described by Great War writers. The intensely loyal relationship between Sam and Frodo, along with other physical displays of affection between Tolkien's male characters, resonate strongly with the soldier relationships portrayed by his Great War contemporaries. See for examples these passages:

> Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: 'I love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. But I love him, whether or no.'

.

> In his lap lay Frodo’s head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam’s brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master’s breast

 .

> He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He
stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away.
‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo.
‘It’s warm!’ said Sam. ‘Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt
so cold through the long nights. But glory and trumpets!’ he cried,
turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. ‘

## Social Norms Around Male Intimacy

Early 20th century Victorian norms discouraged overt affection between men outside of family. However, war disrupted social mores, forcing men into intimate reliance on one another for their very survival. This created a contradiction, where behavior viewed as taboo in peacetime became a crucial way for soldiers to cope with trauma and maintain sanity amidst the battlefield carnage. 

The distinction between homosocial and homoerotic bonds also remained ambiguous. While Tolkien does not delve into eroticism, his emotionally intensive portrayals of male friendship contain hints of latent homoeroticism from a modern lens. With the benefit of hindsight and shifting cultural attitudes, some of the affection between Frodo and Sam could potentially be interpreted as bordering on the erotic. However, when viewed through the lens of Tolkien's wartime experiences and the soldierly bonds common in Great War literature, the homosocial dimensions of these male relationships become more clearly distinct from homoeroticism. 

Overall, the depictions of male affection in Tolkien's work are likely influenced by his experiences during the Great War, as well as the broader context of war literature. These depictions most likely reflect the deep bonds formed under the extreme circumstances of war. The societal norms of the time accepted these relationships in the context of war, but the broader acceptance of physical affection between men varied greatly. Audiences in Tolkien's era would have varying perspectives on the overt homosociality within his works. Some would be shocked by the affection between men, others appreciating its soldierly resonance.

AskHistorians,Was Cleopatra Black? And what it means to talk about historical race,"Good post. I think there are two points, however, that deserve more discussion:

1. I think you underestimate popular acceptance of the idea that ancient Egyptians were black, and modern Egyptians are colonizers. In your academic circles, I'm sure no one takes it seriously. But outside of academics, this type of revisionist history is growing in acceptance, and increasingly supported by celebrities. This documentary is not occurring in a vacuum, but part of a trend toward specific ahistorical narratives being advanced in the mainstream. 

2. Netflix also gave Graham Hancock a platform for his Ancient Apocalypse stuff. I've personally spoken to people who watched it and took it seriously. Again, this is not happening in a vacuum, but part of a trend where ""Every expert has conspired to lie to you. Here's the REAL story"" is being advanced as a narrative across many disciplines, history and archeology among them. People are hearing these ideas and taking them seriously. 

I have no doubt that within the academic world, these are not major issues. But when it comes to the popular understanding of history, they very much are. And ultimately, that's what this entire controversy is about."
AskHistorians,Why has mead become unpopular as an alcoholic beverage while beer and wine stayed and evolved?," To put it simply: cost and the continued influence of the Roman Empire. Honey is much more expensive to produce than grapes and grain, and always has been. By no means does this mean it wasn’t a popular drink. Prehistoric remnants of mead have been found all over the world, including China and India, but I am less versed in eastern history so I can only help illustrate the European perspective. 

A well-rounded understanding of mead in Europe requires an understanding of three separate civilisations, spanning two millennia. To start with we have to address the most obvious, but also the latest: the Norse. While, of course, mead was a part of the culture long before the Viking age of the 9th and 10th centuries AD, this time period is when Norse culture bled into Britain and, to a lesser extent, Central Europe. Despite sharing a common Germanic heritage, there was little cultural exchange between Norse people and the rest of Europe before the vikings (an anachronistic name that originally meant pirate) started raiding them. The drinks of choice for the Norse were beer and mead, with the cold climates of Scandinavia preventing grapes from being cultivated there. Due to similarities in the presence of a pagan pantheon, the Viking age often gets lumped in with the Greeks and Romans, despite sharing no cultural roots and being separated physically and temporally by almost 1000 years. At this point in European history, the alcoholic legacies of Europe were already firmly established, and the popularity of mead couldn’t disrupt the ubiquitous beer and the more refined wine.

The importance of mead is demonstrated through its constant mention throughout Norse mythology. However, it is also present in Greek mythology. In *Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life* (1996), an interesting etymological point is made: the Greek verb ‘to be drunk’ is μεθύω (pronounced meth-ú-ō), which originally derives from Indo-European words for honey, making it cousins with the modern word ‘mead’. It is also noted that the Orphic cult of Dionysus (who had a much more archaic focus in their religious belief system) payed reverence to mead as the precursor to wine, with Zeus intoxicating Kronos with mead to castrate him. The Orphic tradition was one of hedonism and ‘euphoria’ as a form of religious practice, and so this interest in mead is especially notable, given the religious significance they placed on wine. Interestingly, Orphism saw its roots around the 5th Century BC, the Golden Age of Greece, during which mead was a common presence at feasts and other celebrations. Here, the impact of the cost of honey is seen. The Greece of antiquity was a prosperous civilisation, with the Persian War setting up the Delian League, eventually evolving into the Athenian Empire, before the Peloponnesian War crippled this prosperity. It is only in this time period that something as expensive as mead could become a truly popular drink. Following this period of Greek history, mead was seen as an expensive representation of their more glorious history. 

It’s time, then, to talk about wine. The key difference between the Norse and the much earlier civilisations of Greece and Rome is their climate. Greece and, even more so, Italy have a much better climate for grapes, and the prevalence of wine is easily explainable. In the same way that the flat land of Central Europe is perfect for grain cultivation (hence German beer culture), grapes could be grown both in lowlands and alpine regions, leading to a wide variety of flavour in the same drink, and lending itself perfectly to cultivation in Italy. Wine was extremely common and popular in Greece, but the span of Greek imperial history in both size and time meant that it did not earn the same prestige that mead, the drink of the gods and the golden age, did.

Finally, we come to the Roman Empire. The Romans famously elevated Roman culture above that of the barbarians they saw themselves as being surrounded by. Therefore, beer was seen as an unrefined, barbaric drink. While the Romans revered the Greeks as their intellectual precursors, the cultural connection to mead just wasn’t there, especially when their homegrown alcoholic produce, wine, already served as an elevated alternative to beer for much cheaper. As the Romans expanded into the Germanic regions, they retained their love for beer, while also gaining appreciation for wine, while mead was left by the wayside.

Greece had a love for mead, but was too far removed to have an impact on our drinking habits now, while the Vikings were too late to impact an already established drinking culture. The idea that mead has ‘become’ unpopular is a false proposition: aside from specific parts of history, it was never really placed to overthrow beer or wine as the alcoholic drink of choice. This has led to a complete lack of a large market for mead in modern times which, combined with the expense of producing it, has led to a lack of mead in the global stage of alcoholic beverages."
AskHistorians,"I'm an English peasant in the year 1200, and I want to get a dog. How would I go about doing that, and what sorts of dogs would be available?","This one is surprisingly hard to answer - there's very little surviving evidence on medieval pet ownership that isn't about the nobility or rich townsfolk - but I've got together what I can so hopefully it can answer some of what you're curious about. 

> what sorts of dogs would be available?

That's the easily answerable part of your question. There weren't 'breeds' in the modern sense; you would not be able to get a diverse range of distinct dogs like a pug or a chihuahua for example, but medieval encyclopedias tend to sort dogs into a few types that may in turn contain a few subtypes, including a handful of recognisable breeds. Dogs are typically sorted into hounds and lapdogs, and in both visual evidence and literary sources the most common dogs tend to be the greyhound and the maltese lapdog respectively. On the greyhound, the thirteenth century philosopher Albert the Great states: 

> The best of these [greyhounds] have long, flat heads that are not enormous, their ears are small and pointed backward into a point, and the upper lip does not hang down over the lower one unless it is very little. It has a long neck that swells a bit to a size a little larger than the head at the spot where it is joined to the head. It has a massive chest that is well pointed below, long and strong ribs, narrow flanks, a tail that is neither thick nor very long, and tall legs that are thin rather than fat.

Medieval art depicts them in a range of colours, but usually just grey or light brown. See for example [this illustration](https://www.historyhit.com/app/uploads/2020/07/dogs-gaston-1.jpg?x79693) from Gaston de Foix’s treatise on hunting, where he describes the many qualities of the hunting dog and praises his own abilities as a dog breeder. Or this [other illustration](https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef017ee8102a0a970d-500wi) from Harley MS 3244, f. 45r. For England specifically, the sources describe and sometimes depict a type of hound called the mastiff. Albert the Great may not have thought of them as good hounds (hence his comment about the upper lip not overhanging the lower one, as is common on mastiffs) but they were popular in England, such as in [this image of King John with two hounds](https://blogs.bl.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef019aff580558970d-pi); a greyhound in the foreground and behind him a mastiff type dog. However, distinctions between greyhounds and mastiffs (along with alauntes and spaniels) as different types of dog only seem to happen in later medieval texts so in the time you're asking about both would probably be considered the same type of dog and only professional breeders would meaningfully distinguish between them. 

The first thing that the sources make clear is that, as a peasant, you would almost certainly have a hound. And if you're a man, then the hound was also seen as the manlier type of dog. The maltese dogs were typically for urbanites or noblewomen; the sort of person who didn't really want to have to take their dogs for long walks and just wanted some companionship in their house. The encyclopedia of Thomas de Cantimpré states of the maltese lapdogs: 

> ""...these are the smallest dogs, that wealthy matrons bear at their bosoms”

In art, the maltese type lapdogs are also strongly associated with rich women. For example, in [this fourteenth century illustration](https://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef017c366cf31f970b-500wi) of Sir Lancelot having a nice chat with a noblewoman and her dog. And the late medieval philosopher Christina de Piza is sometimes depicted with her dog keeping her company while she worked, such as in [this image](https://blogs.bl.uk/.a/6a00d8341c464853ef019aff57729a970b-500wi) from an early compilation of her work. Or [this one](https://images.headstuff.org/2017/03/12125302/codex.jpg) of a noblewoman greeting someone while her little dog jumps from her lap. 

But you're a filthy peasant, not a well off woman, so it's a hound for you. And because you can't afford to buy from breeders like Gaston de Foix, it's not a good one, which means it would probably be closer to a scruffy mastiff than a sleek, white greyhound. 

> How would I go about doing that? 

This is where things get difficult, because all of the literary evidence on dogs I've found assumes you already have one. Furthermore, all the evidence we have will be in the form of financial accounts or treatises about pets which tend to show buying and breeding among the wealthy, which is an entirely different socioeconomic world to the peasant and therefore not that helpful. Even looking through the secondary literature I couldn't find anything solid on how to acquire dogs specifically - though I did find that thirteenth century Paris was so into pet birds that the breeders/sellers had their own guild. Anyway, as a peasant it's unlikely you'd buy a dog from a breeder. Instead I think it's much more likely that you'd get one from the litter of a friend who already has a dog that are either being given away or sold very cheaply. Even among the elite it was more common to receive pets as gifts than to buy them; even among the financial records of pet purchases there is so much more on cats and birds than there is on dogs. 

On thing that is clear is that when taking ownership of your new dog in England c.1200 you would have to make it 'lawed'; that is to say harmed to meet legal requirements on what a dog can and cannot be capable of. If you did not have permission to own hunting dogs, then your dog could not be physically capable of hunting. Two ways to do this were by removing the dog's claws and filing its teeth so it can't kill, or by cutting the tendons of the dog's rear legs so it cannot chase. According to laws from 1184 there was a fine of three shillings if you didn't have this done, along with additional fines if your dog had been found engaged in hunting. Also, you will be held legally responsible for everything your dog does, including damages for any cattle it panics or textiles it chews, so train it well!

AskHistorians,Is the stress of being “on time” a modern concept?,"**Preamble**

I'm actually in the middle of writing a masters thesis about abstract time. While E.P. Thompsons essay mentioned in the other comment is great, there is more to say about punctuality and being on time. In fact I'd say it is thanks to Thompson that time studies as a field really got popular with historians, but there is also controversy about its validity. I think Thompson still holds up, but it has to be taken with a grain of salt, as it was only meant to be sort of an exploration, not an final study.

My answer will be focused on the german part of Switzerland, as those are the sources I'm most familiar with. More can always be said - if you're interested in the history of abstract time, I'll provide some books in the end.

The answer to your question is a boring 'yes, but'. It really depends on who we're talking about. Generally, being on time is and was important when people had to work together. The more people had to be coordinated, the more important being on time became. I'll give you two examples, in which being on time developed different.

&#x200B;

**Governing and judging**

Medieval cities were ruled by a multitude of different actors which had overlapping competences. Lucerne, a canton and member of the Eidgenossenschaft since 1332, the city and canton were ruled by the Räte \[councils\]. There was the small council who, alongside of the council of the 100, incorporated judicial, legislative and executive powers. In 1470 they introduced the 'Neunergericht' \[a small court consisting of nine people, hence the name\], that should relieve the Räte by judging over smaller issues, but even here we don't have a clear distinction on who exactly does what.

As you can probably guess, coordinating those governing bodies wasn't easy. There were, of course, power struggles, but also one basic problem: How can you rule a city with so many people involved in the government? You had the Räte, who consisted of 18 and 100 people respectively. But there were also clerks, record keepers and - last but not least - the people you judged over. How do you get all those people to show up together?

The answer seems simple: Bells.Before the bigger cities had their first clocks - which happened around 1350-1380 for the biggest cities in europe \[1385 for Lucerne\] - people were being coordinated with bells. One prominant example are church bells, which had to be rung a bit in advance, so when the people heard the bells, they could start making out for the church and be there in time for the sermon.

One of the oldest surviving accounts of an attempt in coordinating the Räte was written down between 1315 and 1321:

>wele dez rates ist, der sol am fritage zů dem rate komen. Und ist er nút im huse, die wil man die gloggen lútet, der git iij s., ob er in der kilchöri ist. Gat aber deheine in den Hof ze kilchun oder ze dien Barfůszen oder ze der Kapelle, hat er dene ein iarzit da oder ist er bi einr lich da ald ist er an daz ze mesze da vor dem heiligen kruze, gat er denne vúrsich dannan zem rate ane geverde, so verschult er enkhein einung. \[1\]

Roughly speaking it calls for members of the council to join the council on fridays. If they're not in the building when the bell rings, they have to pay a fee, altough this fee is dropped if you're too far away (and thus couldn't hear the bell). This is clearly a pressure for council members to be 'on time'.

With later constitutions, this rule gets more and more precise: In 1421, it was ruled that the council would henceforth meet three times a week and as a member you had to go to the council as soon as the bell rang. But now a new rule was introduced: You were not considered late, unless the council finished discussion the first two items of the day. If you joined after those first two items were discussed, you had to pay the fine. \[2\]

While the council was still bound to concrete times \[i.e. bells and the items discussed, which obviously would vary in length\] and not an abstract clock time, the noose is very slowly tightening as rules around punctuality get stricter. Interestingly, it took until 1446 until the council decreed that an hour should be fixed for their meetings, and until 1485 until they dropped the ruling of the first two items and replaced it with a quarter hour (which they probably measured with an hourglass). \[3&4\] This was also roughly the timeframe, when they constricted the meeting in their duration.

This doesn't mean that that problem was fixed though. Throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries you can find countless Ratsordnungen, where the council members tried to tackle the problem of tardiness.

&#x200B;

**So is this a 'pre-modern' problem?**

Now you see, being on time is something people struggled with even in late medieval/early modern periods. In fact, there is a play/poem attributed to Plautus, in which he supposedly responds to the first sundial being erected in ancient rome \[5\] (which was sacked in sicily and brought to rome in 263 BC):

>The gods confound the man who first found outHow to distinguish hours! Confound him, too,Who in this place set up a sun-dialTo cut and hack my days so wretchedlyInto small portions! When I was a boy,My belly was my only sun-dial, one more sure,Truer, and more exact than any of them.This dial told me when 'twas proper timeTo go to dinner, when I had aught to eat;But nowadays, why even when I have,I can't fall to unless the sun gives leave.The town's so full of these confounded dialsThe greatest part of the inhabitants,Shrunk up with hunger, crawl along the streets.

\[6\]

But bear in mind that I have only talked about a very privileged, small part of society - the elite of the city, so to speak, who were part of the government; usually rich, educated and able to read and write. I did not talk about the people summoned to court, which was ruled entirely differently (usually a clerk fetched those and if you didn't show up the first or second day(!), the other person won the case).

Its way more difficult to try and reconstruct the pressure of being on time for a broader public, because - as stated above - many of them weren't able to write their own experiences down. We know some laws, but where they followed or where they merely an ideal, written down by the elites?

When looking at laws written for the public, punctuality isn't as prevalent, at least not in 'abstract' terms. When dancing, drinking or gambling were repressed or forbidden, this was usually done with concrete reminders that everyone understood \[i.e. its forbidden 'in the night' or 'after the firebell rings'\]. There is not the same level of pressure for being on time as we've witnessed for the Räte. \[7\]

When we look at the working population, the work days were organised loosely. From the mid 15th century on the 'tagwan' \[the labor that was done in one day\] was rung with a bell, so that the tagwaner knew when they had to start and finish work. But most workers lived under the roof of their master, so there wasn't such a big need for coordination. Also we don't know much about the lengths of lunch breaks and so on, because much of the life of a Geselle was organised under his masters roof. \[8\]"

Between these answers, and the lively and excellent discussion that took place, I’d like to think we have covered all six questions.)

The actual reason had much to do with ongoing political need than anything else.


The key to it all lies in a unique word that emerged during the reign of Alfred The Great- ‘Angelcynn’ or ‘The English kind’ (later the English peoples).  Alfred styled himself the King of the Angelcynn and the reasons he did so is one of those moments in history that sound simple but once you scratch below the surface… it gets really complicated really quickly.


The exact sequence of events does sound remarkably simple at least.  The Great Heathen Army under the warlord Gunthrum had attacked Wessex (the West Saxon’s), which was at the time supposedly the last independent and free Anglo-Saxon state.  Alfred had been forced to go into hiding.  Here he launches a great insurgency campaign, culminating in the Battle of Edington in 878 wherein Alfred won, and secured for himself a victory of a more political type.  Supposedly Gunthrum agreed to become ruler of East Anglia, while Alfred claimed much of southern Mercia into his extended realm.  The border between the two groups was said to be the old Roman road, Watling Street; on one side would be the land ruled by the Vikings, ‘The Danelaw’ and on the other, this new land… England.


In this nice and easy explanation the reason why Alfred had described his new peoples not as Saxon’s but as Angelcynn was to place the Anglis of Mercia and the Saxons of Wessex on equal footing.  One people, under one king.


It’s a perfectly fine explanation as explanations go.  It does however miss a LOT of small print.  And in that small print, in those fine details, is a much more complicated and fascinating story.  Which I’m gonna talk about as I think this gets closer to the truth of the matter.


So, firstly, Wessex wasn’t the only one of the ancient kingdoms still around at the time.  Mercia was around and was clearly still a geopolitical power in the land (despite Wessex claiming it wasn’t).  The King of Mercia at the time was a man called Burgred who had two claims to fame really a) he was THE most pro-Wessex king Mercia had ever seen and b) he had married into the Wessex royal dynasty.  The second thing may explain why he was the first thing really.


King Burgred of Mercia in 872 we can see happily being in charge of the Mercian kingdom, fighting the Welsh (since that was his focus) and making sure the Great Heathen Army (who were busy rampaging all over the place) simply stayed off his back.  This is probably why he paid them off to keep the peace as they overwintered in London that Winter (leading to the first occupation of London by Vikings under the command of one Halfdan White Shirt), and he was entirely focused on his affairs as the Vikings then returned north.  


Only the Viking’s didn’t just return to the North.  These Norse had taken Northumbria seven years earlier; and they had taken East Anglia only two years previously.  Between these two territories the only patch of land that they did not control on the East coast was the ancient Kingdom and long pacified Mercian region, of Lindsey.  The Vikings fell upon it, PROBABLY because if you held it, you were close enough to East Anglia to sail there in case THEY rebelled against the Vikings and close enough to springboard into Northumbria to reclaim it back, which is what they were able to do.  But taking Lindsey meant they were violating Mercia.  


Then by all accounts, again led by Halfdan, they turned inland and marched upon central Mercia.  According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and a score of historians, over the winter of 873/4 they toppled Burgred and replaced him with a yes man of their own choosing to be king.


Only, unfortunately, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was wrong.  That isn’t what exactly happened.


See, the Viking force in 873, this massive horde, did indeed take up winter residence in Repton, a Mercian centre on the banks of the River Trent, a place that was highly significant to the Mercian royal dynasties, it being the burial place of previous Mercian Kings like Æthelbald, Wigluf and Wigstan.  It was an important dynastic bastion but crucially for a RIVAL dynasty to the one Burgred supposedly claimed descent from.  


Also there is a distinct lack of looting, pillaging and general ‘Viking’ activity taking place on the way to and in Repton.


While the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says this Viking army then toppled Burgred and placed a man called Ceolwulf upon the throne (where his royal title was Ceolwulf II), a man who was to them nothing more than a ‘foolish kings thane’, some historians, especially the specialist in Mercian history Annie Whitehead, suggested that Ceolwulf may well have been a legitimate dynastic rival to Burgred.  And the Viking’s arrival in Repton was not an invasion of a marauding force- rather the arrival of a very powerful bunch of mercenaries.

AskHistorians,"‘Don’t mention the war!”, or, When did Germans become tourists again in post-WWII Europe and how were they received?","I can offer a bit of (partial) information about the return of German tourists in France after 1945. 

German people, in the decade following WW2, were not much able to travel for a simple reason: the ""economic miracle"" had yet to materialize, and they had other priorities, such as the reconstruction of their households. From V-Day to the currency reform of June 1948 that took place in the Western occupation zones, German economy was dominated by barter and black market. While the reform had positive effects, people lost their wartime savings. In 1950, an average middle-class German family of four could only spend about 7% of its budget on leisure, recreation and entertainment: the rest of the budget was used for food, rent, heating, power and essential transport (Kopper, 2008). Vacations, if they were feasible, were taken at home or domestically. In addition, the German tourist industry had been thoroughly destroyed. In the early 1950s, it was still about one-third the size it had been in 1936 (Kosha, 2000). It is thus not suprising that the numbers of German visitors (tourists and business) were extremely low in the late 1940s. British statistics show that there were 55000 German visitors in the UK in 1938: they were 1000 in 1946, 8000 in 1947, 18000 in 1948 and 20000 in 1949 (vs 87000 from France the same year).

It was possible for Germans to go to France in the immediate postwar if they had a good reason to do so that was not ""leisure"", such as business, administration, or academia. In August 1945, Jesuit priest and former Resistance member Jean du Rivau founded the Franco-German magazine *Documents/Dokumente* with the purpose of advancing the cause of Franco-German reconciliation. Rivau organized a first meeting of French and German intellectuals in Offenburg, Germany in 1947, and then another one in Royaumont, France in October 1948. Among the German participants were Joseph Rovan, Eugen Kogon, Walter Dirks, and Elisabeth Langgässer, who all had been opponents to the Nazi regime (Kogon had spent the entire war in Buchenwald), which certainly gave them proper credentials to visit France (Plum, 2007). They were not ""tourists"", but it shows that the French border was not closed to ""good"" Germans. 

Another type of German visitors who were the first to arrive were catholic pilgrims. A German delegation went to Lourdes in 1947 (Courtabessis, 1947) and, two years later, four trains departing from Cologne, Munich, Hannover, and Mainz, transported 1200 German pilgrims, a cardinal and a bishop to Lourdes (*Combat*, 14 July 1949; *L'Aube*, 20 July 1949). In 1950, German visitors in Paris were business people (27%), functionaries (31%), and academics (25%) (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951).

In 1951, France authorized Germans to get tourist visas. The money they could spend was limited to 500 DM + 100 DM for automobile drivers (this limit was raised in 1953, and removed in 1959). The first ""official"" German tourists spent their time in Paris, Lyon, and the Riviera. Numbers of German visitors grew steadily, from a mere 25,000 in 1949 to 400,000 in 1955, reaching 732,000 in 1961, more than British tourists. Half came by road and 35% by train. They were poorer than British and American tourists, with two-third of German tourists staying in 1-star and 2-star hotels vs 49% for the British and 28% for the Americans. Group visits resumed in 1954 (Ginier, 1963). By then, the German economy had been revived, and its tourist industry was working again, with German tour operators sending people abroad by thousands. In 1958, more West Germans traveled abroad than foreigners visited the Federal Republic (Koshar, 2000).

How were German visitors received in France? An article from 1951 (*Carrefour*, 25 July 1951) presents German tourists in a gently mocking way (""The Germans have always been very fond of France. In their own way, of course...""). A [cartoon](https://www.retronews.fr/journal/carrefour-la-semaine-en-france-et-dans-le-monde/25-juillet-1951/1685/3105285/7) shows a (male) German tourist looking at the Eiffel Tower, at Mona Lisa, at a can-can dancer, and then running (lusting) after a woman. The article describes the tourist attractions preferred by the Germans: museums, religious sites, the Eiffel Tower, music halls, and prostitutes. Concerning the latter, the article recommends that the German tourist presents himself as a Swiss citizen: French prostitutes, while loving foreign customers, are not fond of German ones. The article ends by presenting German tourists as discreet and self-effacing, preferring wine to beer, and avoiding to be identified as German. It concludes:

>In general, he is held by hoteliers, taxi drivers, restaurant owners, transporters, to be ""exact, clean, correct and very disciplined"". The war is already far away...

According to Wackerman (1994):

>The Germans, satisfied on the whole with their stay in France, although often below expectations as regards the quality of the service and the tourist offer in general, still complained repeatedly about the coolness of the welcome in the shops or in the street, the psychological barriers being tenacious in all categories of the population and all age groups; in young people, a ""thawing"" or the absence of rejection was nevertheless noticed. 

Genier (1963):

>[The German tourist] does not appreciate the excessive prices charged by a hotel that is questionable for its cleanliness and the vulgarity of its staff. Finally, he would gladly exchange the evening meal, which is too copious, for a modern and better lit room! 

From these short and incomplete presentation, it seems that German tourism was normalized rather quickly in France, basically as soon as Germans were able to afford vacationing abroad in the 1950s. France, of course, was counting on foreign tourists, including German ones, to recapture its position as the Number 1 tourist nation in Europe, which it had lost in the late thirties (Commissariat Général du Tourisme, 1950). The fact that there was more than 700,000 German tourists in 1961 is an indication that they were relatively well received, with the older generations of French people being somewhat colder to them than the younger one. There were occasional slumps (the Suez crisis in 1956, events linked to the Algeria war) but otherwise German tourists enjoyed going to France, and some even came to revisit the places where they had been stationed during the war (Genier, 1963).

AskHistorians,"The Internet Archive is in danger of being shut down, and Is this a modern concern?","I can attempt a brief (-ish) answer here. I work in book history in antiquity, and particularly on the intersection between the destruction of knowledge and the creation of the archive in the early Jewish and early Christian milieu. 

The short answer is that this attitude is not at all new. It is engrained as part of the literary heritage of the Near East, Egypt, Greece, and Rome to at one and the same time (claim to) preserve knowledge from the past (whether distant or recent) and lament that what we have is only fragmentary. In fact many stories of the loss of knowledge/books are built in to stories of their discovery. 

The Letter of Aristeas, a 2nd c. BCE Jewish pseudepigraphon from Alexandria talks one version of the myth of the translation of the Jewish laws (Torah). In it, a group of Jews come from Jerusalem to Alexandria to translate the laws into Greek so that they can be preserved in the Museion at Alexandria. In the story, they ultimately succeed. But part of the impetus for their coming was that the manuscripts of the laws that already existed in Alexandria were both either wrong or decaying (debate about translation of a term here), and in a language that nobody could access. So they were in danger of loss, until they were saved. 

In another context, the myths surrounding the Sibylline Oracles (an anthology of prophetic writings claimed to come from pagan prophetesses, but either actually written or heavily reworked by Christians and Jews in antiquity) all begin with the idea that what is preserved of the these oracles is only a fragment of what previously existed. In the stories, 2/3 of the oracles were burned with fire before the Roman king Tarquinius accepted them for safekeeping. After he does keep them, he sends out people all over the mediterranean to pick up whatever they can to fill in the gaps. But these are just fragments of what otherwise existed. Even later, stories say that many were destroyed in the time of Sulla, and then later by Augustus himself, further reducing their number. These stories can be found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Pliny, Tacitus, the Tübingen Theosophy, and the prologue to the Sibylline Oracles, among other places. 

We have similar attitudes when talking about the archive (as a concept that approximates the knowledge of the past) in the presentation of the books of Enoch (a 3rd c. BCE-1st c. CE anthology of heavenly visions attributed to a primordial figure), and 4Ezra (a late 1st-early 2nd c. CE work attributed to the biblical figure Ezra). In each of these, the books that exist and are being passed down are only a fraction (and not even the most important fraction) of knowledge that has been recorded. 

We even find this sentiment in Deuteronomy 29 where there is secret knowledge that belongs only to Yahweh, while revealed knowledge is for the public. This verse, or the sentiment behind it, seems to have spurred those who wrote some of the works in the Dead Sea Scrolls  (a 1st c. BCE-1st c. CE group of scrolls found in the Judean/Jordanian desert), and also early rabbis (who wrote the Mishnah, Tosefta, and Gemara) to produce their own knowledge as a way to access/present some of that secret knowledge. 

Eva Mroczek, the foremost scholar in this field has suggested that this attitude, whether in the distant past, or the present, has to do with anxiety over knowledge in the past always being incomplete, always being fractured, and always lacking something we wish we had. So whether we talk about Alexandria, the Sibylline books, or the Torah (or the internet archive), the anxiety about the quality and state of our archive is not new.

AskHistorians,"What impact did the release of the movie ""Space Jam"" have on the trade between the Han dynasty and the Roman Empire?","I can only speak from the Han dynastic side but it was considerable. Late, only in 166, but considerable. 

There had been trade of sorts, every now and again merchants arriving on the southern coasts of China and overland but through many hands between Rome (Daqin) and China so there had not been formal contact. To know another's government is the key for any proper trade, that establishes proper trade routes and agreements, without that only flickers. 

In 97 the adventurous Ban Chao sent his staff officer Gan Ying to try to make contact but he was persuaded at the Persian Gulf that this would be too long a journey by Parthian locals who were big fans of Mr. Swackhammer and were opposed to the idea of such trade. In 120, the King of Shan had passed on gifts from Rome including some jugglers and acrobats, the odd glassware came across to China, Dowager Dou once arranged for perfume to be bartered for and sometimes silk sent to neighbours would reach all the way to Rome.

In 166, a ship arrived on the south coast of China, dispatched by Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and led by a young Qin Lun. They didn't have much to offer, being a long journey there had perhaps been some damage (and perhaps some items grabbed along the way), but Qin Lun brought ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Emperor Huan was young but polite and it was a political boon, so soon after the overthrow of the regicide regent Liang Ji and recent troubles at court, to have this distant tribute arrive. Qin Lun knew he needed to get stronger relations so he brought it his most prized personal possession: A copy of the Spacejam script. 

Emperor Huan had, in overthrowing the handsome, stuttering basketball playing controller Liang Ji, taken over the pleasure palaces of him and Sun Shou his fashionable wife. There Emperor Huan, to show off his luxurious gains and his authority, took Qin Lun so they could have a reading of it with senior members of his court. While we don't have the exact reaction, what followed would suggest it was a hit.

A trade agreement was signed within hours of the reading and though neither side could be said to have given full free trade, there was a boon across the long distances with some of the middle men cut out. Han gentry, as part of showing off their wealth (outdoing the neighbours is a practise as old as time) would buried with Roman glassware, the great women wore Roman perfume and earrings (this did not help with complaints about the cost of Emperor Huan and three kingdoms Emperors Liu Shan and Cao Rui harems) while the Emperors valued pearls, coral and coloured stones. Silk would travel so much freer-er to Rome with road projects, that became known as the Silk Road for silk would be cut to open new sections, pushed to help improve the overland trading routes

There was limit to what any trade deal could do, the distance between the Empires was vast but as Space Jam spread, China took a new appreciation. Attitudes towards those who were not Chinese was hostile, dismissive, to treat them as barbarians and these had often led to trouble. However with ""the Daqin"", the gentry of China came to believe they were exiled Chinese for how else could they share such values as shown in Space Jam? Rome was held up as an ideal.

In 185, Huan's artistic successor Emperor Ling, suffered huge damage to his palace in a fire. Emperor Ling decided to use this to make things bigger and better, having the great eunuch engineer Bi Lan work on water supplies to the capital Luoyang and to statues but, using heavy levies, he also ordered in a lot of glass from Rome to help make the palace better then before, to tap into the fairy world connection that China had with coloured glass. To counter-act the power of the He clan and with the Han miliatry crumbling from years of overstretch, he also requested miliatry support from Rome.

Alas this would prove unfortunate. It took till September 189 for the legion to reach the capital, by which point Emperor Ling was dead and this much loved palace was set on fire amidst infighting. With the He brothers and eunuchs all dead during a few bad nights of assassination, butchery, looting and fire, there was a vacuum at the capital. The nearby general Dong Zhuo was in a stalemate with a small force but when the legion arrived, he used it to claim Rome backed him and were sending reinforcements. The army at the capital (called the Northern Army), leaderless after He Jin's death, joined Dong Zhuo, Lu Bu was impressed by the legion and murdered his master Ding Yuan. With that, Dong Zhuo seized control at court and a civil war was about to begin. I do think it is under-appreciated how the combination of Dong Zhuo's experienced Liang core, the Northern Army and that legion saw the coalition against Dong Zhuo avoid battle and go for a wise blockade to weaken Dong Zhuo's ability to project power and feed his court. 

Alas the civil war did disrupt trade and relations but not entirely. Merchants still got through and Wei scholar Yu Huan, after Cao Cao's conquest of the Liang warlords reopened a possible route, would go on a cultural exchange trip to Rome itself, his account of the lands of Rome in the Weilue considered an invaluable outside perspective on Rome. It has flaws, as an outsider he didn't always understand what he was seeing and he probably wrote some years after his return and relying on memory. In the late 220's to mid 230's Qin Lun would later return to China, in his late years, to see the land one last time, he find a land torn apart by civil war and be treated at the court of the southern Emperor Sun Quan. Some of the recently captured Shanyue did well in a game of basketball so would be taken back to Rome as a gift by Sun Quan to his basketball loving friends the Daqin.

AskHistorians,How did the computer game *Oregon Trail* become ubiquitous in US schools during the 80s?,"Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, one of the biggest tech clusters in the country
was Minnesota. It was home to a group of large computing companies like Honeywell, UNIVAC,
and IBM Rochester, with 14,000 workers all put together across 21 plants.

Related to this, there was a large push to connect all high schools to computers; 1965
had a single high school, UHigh (University High School) connected to a mainframe via
teletype, and this eventually expanded in 1967 with TIES, or Total Information for Educational System, 
involving eighteen Minnesota school districts. These connections were made with teletype:
not using a monitor, but printers that would dial into a central server hosted at a university.
(This was doing ""time-sharing""; even though the computers were technically ""slow"", they were
still much faster than a single person and had large chunks of downtime waiting for user
input, so multiple users were able to be accomodated at the same time.)

It was in this environment, in the December of 1971, where the first version of Oregon Trail (or initially, OREGON) was devised. 

Don Rawitsch was a student teacher with an 8th grade class in US history, and during a western expansion unit
tried his hand at designing a board game for the class. At the time he was roommates with Bill Heinemann and
Paul Dillenberger, both who had taken computer classes at Carleton, and suggested that the board game might
be better as a computer game instead.

At the time, there was something of a disjoint in computational educational circles between those who
were interested in computers as a method for doing raw drills, only with the computer more carefully choosing
problems (Computer-Assisted Instruction, or CAI) versus those who were interested in computers as simulators;
i.e. The Sumerian Game from 1964 (designed by the school teacher Mabel Addis) where the player is 
tasked as king of the Babylonian people and must allocate crops and contend with plagues.

The trio of Rawitsch, Heinemann and Dillenberger's project fell into the latter: simulating a trip
on the Oregon Trail, done entirely in text. 

>DO YOU WANT TO (1) STOP AT THE NEXT FORT, (2) HUNT, OR (3) CONTINUE

Many of the aspects of the game from the original text version are recognizable in the 80s version;
having to buy oxen, food, and ammunition; having to go hunting with a mini-game — in the
teletype version, you had to type BANG quickly enough when prompted:

>WHENEVER YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR TRUSTY RIFLE ALONG THE WAY, YOU WILL SEE THE WORDS: TYPE BANG.  THE FASTER YOU TYPE"" IN THE WORD 'BANG' AND HIT THE 'RETURN' KEY, THE BETTER"" LUCK YOU'LL HAVE WITH YOUR GUN.

There were even technically sound effects, applying an ASCII code to ring the internal bell of the teletype.

(Dysentery, sadly, did not get added until later.)

Native Americans were only mentioned explicitly in a line about
""HELPFUL INDIANS SHOW YOU WHERE TO FIND MORE FOOD"". When attacked, the player
is attacked by ""riders"", which Rawitsch stated while technically including Indians, was meant to 
indicate bandits were more likely. (In fact, throughout the versions of the game, fairly close
attention was taken to the likelihood of events -- percentages of people who died on the
actual trail were intended to match the percentage chance of death in the game. That is,
the simulation conveyed _the probability of particular events happening_ in a way that
was visceral, which is hard to do with students with a dry notice about x% of people
dying from dysentery.)

Arriving successfully results in congratulations:

>PRESIDENT JAMES K. POLK SENDS YOU HIS HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS AND WISHES YOU A PROSPEROUS LIFE AHEAD AT YOUR NEW HOME

This project was popular with the class, but it was essentially shelved afterwards; the
code was deleted off the server although Rawitsch kept a printout of the sourcecode.

TIES eventually turned into MECC (the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium) in 1973 and was a huge success;
by 1975 they served 84% of the students in public school, and the governor declared
October 19-25 in 1975 to be Computer Week. This is long before many districts through
the country
even had a notion of computer capability.

Don Rawitsch was hired in 1974. While there pulled out his own game and revamped it, although still in text; the earliest version we have is dated March 1975. (The 1971 source code is lost, although we can technically reconstruct it a little from the 1975 version. This is because BASIC uses line numbers, and the traditional ""skip"" is to go by 10s, so the ""irregular number"" lines are likely the new additions from 1975.)

OREGON was an _enormous_ success in Minnesota, logging 5000 user sessions over the 77-78 school year. MECC
had bough 500 Apple IIs for Minnesota classrooms by 1980, and with that came a new port of Oregon (with
some graphics, but not much; [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z5zwA-tw3Q)). This became a flagship product for MECC, who eventually became an educational powerhouse,
with a 1985 version (the one that become a huge seller and the one everyone remembers from school). Updates happened in 1990 (when an investment group bought MECC from the state of Minnesota), 1992, 1993, and 1995, by which point Oregon Trail was making about $10 million of MECC's $30 million in revenue.

AskHistorians,What might have happened to my grandfather’s body? KIA/MIA Vietnam War,"To date the remains of three soldiers remain unrecovered from Hill 875, where the friendly fire incident occurred. There have been continued efforts to recover, but as of yet those have been unsuccessful.

While the individual you spoke to may have some recollection, it's important to understand that oral histories change over time, and memories often meld together. It's not to say he lied, but that he may not remember events from 50 years ago clearly - or may have combined memories from one event with another. This is extremely common for combat oral histories given the stress of the event and compartmentalization as a way to deal with PTSD triggering memories.

The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency is tasked with overseeing recovery of remains, and maintains a complete listing of all those who have not been recovered.

You can search records for Vietnam MIA [here](https://dpaa-mil.sites.crmforce.mil/dpaaFamWebVietnam). Each entry will have a status on the case (Under Review, Active Pursuit, Deferred, and Non-Recoverable). 

At present, the unrecovered remains from Hill 875 are all in Active Pursuit. 

Making an assumption based of your post history making mention of the Ute, and one of those unrecovered being from Colorado with a possibly indigineous last name, it appears your grandfather may have been one of those three. You can search his name at the above link.

At the bottom of the page for each member is a link to contact information for each branch's Casualty Collection Office. That office can provide family with up to date information on recovery efforts, as well as the records pertaining to the events which led to his disappearance.

Those records are, by far, the most complete and accurate information you will be able to find without a comprehensive oral history of survivors from the unit - which given the time span is very unlikely to be possible and/or more accurate than the official record.

Most classical music was written for a specific purpose - an opera for a particular opera house for a particular date. A church piece for a particular church service. A sonata commissioned by a particular noble. A symphony commissioned by a particular person for a major event. And a lot of these events were held in private locations for invited guests.

Did they have fans? Yes of course. But those fans would typically be limited to the aristocracy and people with a fair bit of money. Hiring  a composer, musicians, and having a room large enough for them to perform in was very costly, and very much beyond the reach of most people. Neither were there recordings, and most musicians (and most people) in pubs couldn't read at all, let alone read sheet music. 

Sometimes there would be public performances, ticketed events that the general public could attend. These would be advertised by papers, posters, invite, and word of mouth. Things like opera companies would have regular seasons, and you would typically buy out an entire box for the season (again, lots of money), though often individual tickets were available. These would be less costly, but still out of the range of a working class person for most of the 
16th-19th centuries. 

If you did have money, and you were a fan of a composer, you would commission them to write something for you, and you would either play it yourself, or hire people to play it for you. If you were extremely wealthy, you could become the patron of a composer, and they could write for you part/full time. The composer would often live in your household, and perform their work for you and your guests when you entertained. If you had this kind of money, you would often have your own musicians employed to play for you at your beck and call. It was definitely a mark of status to have a composer writing music for you. 

Up until quite recently, music outside of folk music, church music, or music you made at home would be totally out of reach for the majority of people in Europe. 

So the answer to ""How did anyone know"" is, by and large, they didn't. Music of this kind was a luxury item reserved for the rich.

AskHistorians,Why did the World Fair stop being a major event?,"The trade show aspect (incredible new steam engines! super-sized canteloupes!) was supplanted by industry-specific expositions.

The aspect of displaying unusual foreign cultures and faraway lands came to seem exploitative, and didn’t interest nations who wanted to demonstrate how modern they were, not how quaint and exotic.  In addition, it became possible for large numbers of people to simply visit other countries instead of viewing a reconstructed village.

The midways full of thrill rides were supplanted by theme parks such as Disney and Six Flags.

Television reduced the curiosity-seeking value of static displays, and pavilions began to simply be theaters for viewing television programs.

Late-20th century expos, especially in North America, seemed overwhelmed by the corporate pavilions, which were of dubious marketing value to the companies and could seem a little distasteful to attendees.

Morris Dickstein expands on these themes in his essay “From the Thirties to the Sixties: The World’s Fair in its own Time,” published in *Remembering the Future: The New York World’s Fair from 1939 to 1964.* Alfred Heller's book *World's Fairs and the End of Progress* discusses these same developments and reviews all the late 20th century fairs in that context.

AskHistorians,Poland was one of the first countries in Europe to officialy decriminalize same sex acts (1932) and to set equal age of consent for gay people (1948) yet now it is the most homophobic country in EU with no partnership recognition. How did that happened?,"This is a very interesting question which deserves an answer of some kind. However, there are some issues with it. For example, is Poland really the most homophobic country in the EU? Nevertheless, it is worth looking at in more detail. 

A historian of the Catholic church, or even theology in general, may focus on the role of the church in answering this question – which would, undoubtedly, be very interesting and of great value. Due to my own personal background I prefer to focus on the role of communism. This is not illogical as it accounts for the majority of the time between 1932 and the present. However, it is far from the only possible approach. 

There is, admittedly, a tendency to focus on religion when discussing this issue in the literature (e.g. *Antagonism in the Making: Religion and Homosexuality in Post-Communist Poland* by Dorota Hall). However, it should be noted that even the mentioned text is actually a chapter in a broader book discussing the regional situation (*Religious and Sexual Nationalisms in Central and Eastern Europe*). 

If it is a regional issue, it makes Poland appear a little less unique than the question might suggest. For example, opinions on gay [marriage](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FT_18.10.29_eastWest_keyFindings_SSM420px.png) suggest that Poland is broadly in line with, in some cases even more progressive than, neighbouring countries. Moreover, there are six EU countries (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Poland and Romania) where rainbow families are not formally recognised. What appears to link these countries is not particularly region, given that Latvia and Lithuania are northern, Slovakia and Poland central, and Bulgaria and Romania Balkan, but a history of communism. 

In many communist countries the penal code of the previous regime had penalised homosexuality and this was just retained by the communist authorities. However, it is notable that in Poland the absence of criminality for same-sex acts was retained. Legalised would not be the right word as the experience of Foucault clearly indicates. Moreover, if not directly criminalised it did not prevent certain victimisation, as in Operation Hyacinth. 

What makes the matter even murkier is that it does not seem to matter much whether the communist regime never criminalised homosexuality directly, as in Poland; decriminalised it, as in Czechoslovakia 1962 and Bulgaria 1968, or gradually decriminalised it in Hungary; decriminalised it and then recriminalized it, as in the USSR. It also doesn’t seem to make a huge amount of difference how religious a country is, only 7% of Latvians regularly attend a church service, while in Poland the number of weekly attendees 42%. How Catholic a country is also does not seem to be as impactful as one could expect with Hungary and Poland taking similar anti-LGBT stances with vastly different levels of Catholic identification in the country (37% vs. 92%). The result still sees rainbow families are not formally recognised (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Poland and Romania) or incredible societal barriers to acceptance. 

There is no simple answer to such a complicated question, but it appears that the most plausible explanation can be found in the history of communism. That being said, a convincing explanation of public attitudes to homosexuality across varies different communist countries in Europe remains illusive to the best of my knowledge. Someone may yet come forward with a more thorough source which may better explain the situation than I have here, until then I will suggest a few sources which discuss the issues in some detail. The contradictions are discussed in 3.3 of *Transnational Homosexuals in Communist Poland: Cross-Border Flows in Gay and Lesbian Magazines* by Szulc.

AskHistorians,"In the early years of the US, did the Supreme Court justices reach out to the founding fathers to help interpret their intent when writing the Constitution while deliberating cases? Were the founding fathers ever brought in to give expert testimony?","This is a massive question that is kind of foundational to the basis of Constitutional law in the United States. First, it is important to note that many of the first Supreme Court Justices were themselves Founding Fathers. John Jay (the first Chief Justice) wrote five of the Federalist Papers (more on those later) and was a massive advocate for the ratification of the Constitution. John Rutledge (one of the first Associate Justices and the second Chief Justice) was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and actually chaired the Committee of Detail that wrote the first draft of the Constitution. Further, it must be said that ""The Founding Fathers"" were in no way a monolithic bloc. Just as today, there were many different factions and parties vying for influence and control of the newly-founded country. There were arguments about whether the Constitution should even be ratified. There were arguments about what should be put in the Bill of Rights. There were arguments about whether there should even *be* a Bill of Rights. So, a question of Justices reaching out to ""The Founding Fathers"" is inherently a tricky one because there really was no group of ""The Founding Fathers"" to reach out to, and if there were, many of them would be included.

Any discussion of the early Supreme Court begins and ends with John Marshall. I don't think it's controversial to say he is the most influential jurists to ever sit on the Supreme Court. Prior to him being named Chief Justice, the Supreme Court was viewed as the ""lesser"" branch, and many were legitimately questioning why it was even needed. Under Marshall's tenure, the first ""real"" Supreme Court case was Marbury vs. Madison. It's an extremely complicated case (and did *not* create judicial review out of thin air, but that's a story for another time), but basically, the issue centered around whether or not a man (Marbury) had a right to a commission after being nominated as a judge by John Adams in the last days of his presidency. Given limitations on communication at the time, Adams' Secretary of State could not deliver it before his term ended, and Thomas Jefferson, the new president, ordered his Secretary of State to not deliver them because he believed they were void and expired once Adams' term ended. Marbury sued Jefferson's Secretary of State, claiming it was valid.

The kicker here is that Adams' Secretary of State was John Marshall, and Jefferson's Secretary of State was James Madison. A party in the case was the ""father of the Constitution"" and the Chief Justice presiding over the case was also to some degree a party. Without getting too much into legal jargon, the Court held that Madison withholding Marbury's commission was in fact illegal, but the entire case was moot because the law that caused the case to come before the Court in the first place was unconstitutional. In doing so, he quoted Hamilton's Federalist No. 78 on the concept of judicial review and firmly established the Court's role as an equal branch of government. 

So, to answer your question, the answer is *kind of*. In Marbury v. Madison, Marshall ruled that what Madison, the *Father of the Constitution*, did was illegal. But in doing so, he also utilized works from the Federalist Papers, many of which Madison himself wrote. So, while yes, Supreme Court Justices did in fact utilize the works of the framers of the Constitution when writing opinions, they did not reach out to ""the experts"" when making these decisions, as there really was no such group with that level of authority. In fact, Marshall himself in a later case of McCulloch v. Maryland said that in many cases the Federalist Papers can and should be ignored. In the early years of the American judiciary, there really was no consistency, and by the time firm legal theories began to be established in the mid-19th century, the opportunity to reach out to Founding Fathers had been lost."

AskHistorians,"How did Switzerland, a landlocked European country, become so well known for fine chocolates when both sugar and cacao are grown far away in mostly tropical places?","I have actually answered this question before! Answer pasted below:

When chocolate was first imported from the Americas, it was little like the bars you're used to today - for one thing, it was typically consumed by North/Central Americans as a ~~bitter, cold drink~~ (check out /u/pompion-pie's response below for a correction on this! The Spanish began to add ~~spices and~~ sugar in order to make it more palatable [to their taste], ~~and heated it up~~; they also routinely ground the cacao beans ahead of time and formed them into solid blocks for transport across the Atlantic, which could be broken up and dissolved in hot water with sugar to make hot chocolate. In the early nineteenth century, Coenraad Van Houten invented a press for fully splitting the cocoa butter and cocoa mass, as well as the Dutch process, which made the powdered cocoa mass taste sweeter and mix better with water - and by combining the Dutch-process cocoa powder with the cocoa butter, it was possible to make an edible solid chocolate! (Pieces of edible chocolate were first made by the British company Fry & Sons, a rival to Cadbury, and in 1847 they had developed a way of mixing cocoa powder, melted cocoa butter, and sugar into a paste that could be shaped into chocolate bars.)

For the most part, European hot chocolate had been a luxury product, consumed by the elite, but by the end of the eighteenth century it had trickled down to the masses. It was particularly popular in Italy, where it was even added to normal mealtime foods, and people who were interested in learning the trade often went to learn from Italian confectioners' expertise - people like François-Louis Cailler, the creator of the first chocolate factory in Switzerland in 1819. He was followed in the nascent Swiss chocolate industry by Philippe Suchard and Charles-Amédée Kohler within the next decade. While Kohler's pretty important for inventing the idea of a chocolate bar with nuts in it, the real player here is Cailler's son-in-law, Daniel Peter, a generation later. Peter had come up with the idea of adding milk to Fry & Son's paste mixture to make a creamier bar on his own, but simply couldn't get it to work: it became mildewy. But Henri Nestlé, an industrialist who had developed powdered milk as a potential alternative to wet-nurses, was living and working in the same town, and the two were able to put their products and knowledge together to combine powdered cacao and powdered milk, removing the water that caused the mildew from the equation in 1875. Milk chocolate! 

Rodolphe Lindt, a former apprentice under Kohler, worked off of these earlier developments to create the process known as ""conching"" at the end of the nineteenth century. Conching is basically running all of the ingredients - cocoa powder, cocoa butter, sugar, etc. - in a mixer continuously for several days, which makes sure that the entire thing is as homogeneous as possible, the cocoa butter perfectly distributed and the texture smoother. Instead of a paste, the result is a liquid that can be poured into molds, too, which has implications for speed of production and the product's look.

It's after all of this had been done that Switzerland came to be at the forefront of the chocolate industry. At the very beginning of the twentieth century, many of these historic firms were consolidating, combining their wealth and factories to produce more and more and more chocolate - so much that Switzerland's population couldn't buy it all. In response, the companies began to market their products to the rest of the world, and concentrated on improving the quality of chocolate to outshine competitors from other countries rather than innovating in other ways (coming up with new textures or fillings, etc.).

Edit: It's worth mentioning that Belgium *is* now considered to be a source of high-quality chocolate, actually - but that's a much more relatively recent reputation. Belgium only began to export more chocolate than it imported in the 1960s, when a deliberate effort was made by the government to promote ""Belgian chocolate"" as a kind of brand."
AskHistorians,"Who/what was the serpent who tempted Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden first intended to be, in the Torah? Christian layfolk often refer to it as Satan, but someone pointed out that the story predates the Christian conception of Satan by nearly 2000 years. Was it just a sneaky snek? A literary trope?","I had saved this question because I wanted to eventually get to it, sad that no-one ever answered it in a satisfactory manner  - I probably  won't either, but at least I can cite some sources. 

To begin, that comment is right - The concept of ""the Devil"" or ""Satan"" as a concrete being who was either in the garden, in the book of Job, etc, is not original to the Hebrew Bible. That reading is a re-negotiation of the meaning of those texts. The figure of ""The devil"" is a latecomer on the scene (Collins, 38). Interpreter of these ancient texts in a later period, the 2nd Temple Period, would interpret this serpent to be an Eternal Tempter, the Devil, and a wicked dragon, in texts like Enoch, the Apocalypse of Moses, and the Book of Revelation, respectively. 

John J. Collins notes that ""Talking animals are a standard device in the literary  genre of the fable, which was developed most famously by the Greek writer Aesop. The  appearance of a talking snake should alert even the most unsophisticated reader to the fictional nature of the story. The snake articulates the voice of temptation, but it is not yet the devil or Satan"" (Collins, 38).

AskHistorians,"Henry Kissinger, turning 100 years old soon, has been said to be responsible via his policy decisions to have killed 3-4 million civilians worldwide. How much of Kissinger's role reflected his own personal view and calls, and how much was it shaped by the US government's own interests and agenda?","Let me preface this by saying that Henry Kissinger is a war criminal. Even if he will die free, never having been charged for any of the many, many crimes committed under his supervision, he is a war criminal. But to personally single him out as the sole architect of the deaths of any concrete or estimated number of people without acknowledging the context he acted in is dangerous, and falls more within the purview of sensationalist journalism than historical writing. When a US president decides to invade a country, you can make the argument that they are amongst the foremost responsible parties, but even then it’s impossible to just responsibilize them directly and solely for the casualties that ensue. When you consider that Kissinger’s actions and decisions affected other nations, where any number of crimes were committed by other people, the line between individual responsibility and collective, systematic planning becomes even blurrier. Even authoritarian dictators can’t be considered to be solely responsible for the horrors their policies inflict, because there is always a wider apparatus of individuals and institutions that implement said policies. This kind of “Evil” Great Man theorization is the kind of thing Hannah Arendt cautioned against in Eichmann in Jerusalem, when she created the concept of “banality of evil” to explain that the actions of individuals in any political context need to be understood as part of a wider ethos and zeitgeist that shapes their agency alongside that of many others who take part in heinous crimes against humanity. Singling out one person as a sort of mythologized monster detracts both from seeking full accountability from the many perpetrators and parties responsible, agency from the society they participate in and which condones and legitimizes their actions, and ultimately dilutes the experiences of the victims to just mere numbers in a horrific narrative. That’s not to say Henry Kissinger isn’t a war criminal, but rather, that he was not alone.

Kissinger is an advocate of Realism, an IR school of thought primarily developed as a framework by German political scientist Hans Morgenthau. As per a previous answer of mine, we can define IR realism as a systemic approach to geopolitics directly associated with pragmatism and utilitarianism, and its essence is this: considering the facts of a matter, the specific circumstances and characteristics of an event, as well as carefully analyzing the consequences of an action, should be more important than any moral ideological considerations.

Mario del Pero, who specializes in international history, explains that, even from a young age, Kissinger showed a keen interest in dictating and designing the future foreign policy of the United States, promoting from his very earliest academic writings the idea that, were it to succeed in this newfound post-WWII destiny it had been given, the young and inexpert US had to look to the Europe that won the Napoleonic wars and defeated the revolutionary fervor of the 19C in order to defeat the new radical threats to capitalist order and legitimacy: communism.

Throughout the Cold War, his writings emphasize this belief, taking it even further, exploring the idea that, where foreign policy was concerned, all means justify the goal of the US maintaining its hegemony over communism. Essentially, he believed that the US had to use force and interventionism, because they were the only ways in which a power could “(...) vindicate its interpretation of justice or defend its ‘vital interests’ (...)”. However, given the nuclear nature of the possible conflict, believing that such a thing as total victory in a direct conflict was achievable without the destruction of the planet was a delusion, and so, proxy wars and interventions were the necessary way forward in securing global domination against communism. He maintained this policy of “shadow intervention” both outside the US throughout both his tenures as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, and even within, later on, as a sort of “Shadow Secretary”, as Cold War historian Jussi Hanhimaki puts it, during the administrations of later presidents after Ford like Reagan and George H. W. Bush, who didn’t summon him to be an official cabinet member, but still maintained constant informal contact and exchanges with him, while also appointing former aides and underlings of his as their own Secretaries of State, National Security Advisors and members of the Foreign Service. This proxy presence, coupled with the weight his highly profitable private sector consulting company, Kissinger Associates, carried in the geopolitical arena, allowed him to maintain a considerable degree of influence over policy making despite not being officially in charge. While it would be unethical and disingenuous to claim that his influence alone was what shaped the “US government's own interests and agenda” as you put it, it would also be ridiculous to pretend like there was not a correlation between his constant presence and the way different presidents, democrats and republicans alike, viewed foreign policy and the necessary evils of letting Kissinger (you know, the war criminal) act ipso facto.

Through all his decades in the halls of power of US foreign policy, Kissinger remained an adjustable realist, but a realist nonetheless, never even considering applying some of the less abrasive, interventionist and scorched-earth minded ideas of growingly influential theories, like Immanuel Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory. Instead, Kissinger's adaptability had more to do with changing economic tendencies and political sensibilities, but pursuing the same goals as before, than with actually trying to change any of the objectives of US foreign involvement. Because he held so much influence over Washington, for most of the second half of the 20C, his own memories and writings were considered to be the only mainstream authoritative accounts of what the US had been doing outside, and therefore, public opinion in the states remained largely on his side. But even when faced with extensive criticism from investigative reports and scholarly works that examined his policies and the catastrophic results of their implementation in terms of loss of human life and regional destabilization all over the world, he never relented in his views and justifications for his actions. Even though prominent investigative journalists and political analysts like Seymour Hersh and Christopher Hitchens published extensive research on the violent results of Kissinger’s policies, particularly analyzing the Vietnam War and Iran. Hell, Hitchens’ 2001 book *The Trial of Henry Kissinger* is largely the cause for our collective view of Kissinger as personally, solely, single-handedly responsible for engineering hundreds of massacres all over the globe, and a free war criminal (which, you know, he is).

So, to finally answer your question, today, we know that Henry Kissinger played a significant role in the ultimate demise of possibly millions of people all over the globe, and we understand that the policies he devised came, in fact, from his own ideological beliefs. He acted in conjunction with several different presidents who all evidently agreed with him on how things should be done when it came to US foreign interventionism. So it is safe to say that he impacted and influenced the development of the agendas of these governments quite heavily. For a very specific example, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f5t8rn/comment/fi11pis/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where I talked about his involvement in the staging of the 1976 military coup in Argentina, there you can find a transcript of declassified documents from a meeting in which he and his advisors specifically talk about the acceptability of the violent state terrorism campaign the military was planning on carrying out against the civilian population. 

But we should understand that he was also influenced by a larger agenda, which is the mentality of the United States society during the Cold War, and that he functioned within and collaborated with a much larger state apparatus and bureaucracy that allowed for the atrocities he is chiefly, but not solely responsible for, to be carried out. Attempting to understand Kissinger’s outwards ideas and policies without considering the effects Jim Crow, McCarthyism, the exponential growth of the military industrial complex, and even J. Edgar Hoover’s internal persecutions had on the public’s opinion of the majority of the US population would be negligent. So the question we should be asking ourselves should probably be “**how and why did the Cold War era United States society allow Henry Kissinger, you know,** ***the war criminal*****, to commit his war crimes and then go free?**”

AskHistorians,"In U.S. television situation comedies (sitcoms) from the 50s, 60s, and early 70s, there is a common trope of a male office worker inviting his boss to a homecooked dinner with the ultimate goal of asking for a raise or currying favor for a promotion. Did this really happen? If so, how common was it?","While there's always more that can be said, I answered a [similar question a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kyb18x/in_1950s_america_was_it_common_for_the_boss_and/):

There's an adage in education that's basically, ""we measure what matters."" Which is to say, we can get a sense of what a community or society value based on the knowledge, skills, or dispositions assessed in schools. (There's often a disconnect between the things adults claim to value and the things we ask children to learn but that's a different conversation for a different subreddit.)

So, given that adage and an understanding of American education history, I feel comfortable saying yes, ""dinner with the boss"" was a thing that happened - or teachers thought might happen - and my primary evidence is that the NYS Regents Examinations in Comprehensive Vocational Homemaking routinely asked about entertaining, including for their husband's boss.

First, context setting. NYS has the oldest formal system of education in the United States, dating back to the 1780s. This headstart meant New York policymakers and educators were experimenting with different structures long before some other states were even considering the possibility of public education. After a few different approaches to funding and curriculum, the structure that NYS fell into, and stuck with to the present day, was based on the idea that in order to ensure consistency across the state, there needed to a common measure of student learning. This measure, which was first given in the mid-1800s is colloquially known as *The Regents Exams*. I won't subject you to a history of the exams (as fascinating as I think it is) but basically, they're a series of exams given to high school students across the state as a way to document their mastery of content the state deems necessary before they'll award a high school diploma with a Regents endorsement.

For the purpose of your question, the most important feature was the feedback loop between NYS teachers and the exams. (At one point in the early 1900s, there were upwards of 90 different Regents exams. Schools/students could pick and choose which ones to take.) Teachers across the state determined the content for the exams and then went back to their classrooms and taught students the content that would appear on the exams. Teachers who did not participate in the writing process were given guides on what would appear (AKA standards.) They didn't know the exact questions on the exams but, for example, the teachers who taught bookkeeping knew there would be several questions where students had to solve long arithmetic problems by hand and show their work. So they taught their students how to solve complicated arithmetic problems by hand and show their work. Etc.

This doesn't mean Homemaking was offered at every NYS high school or that all girls had to take the course, but rather, there were NYS HS teachers who wanted to offer the course and felt their course content was worthy of inclusion in the pool of knowledge students learned as part of obtaining a diploma. At some point in the early 1930s, a group of NYS educators proposed courses and a corresponding exam called Comprehensive Vocational Homemaking. Their rationale and the exact year is several hundred miles away from me in the state's archive, but I know from other research that the time between proposal and exam administration was typically 1-3 years. Students then needed 3 years of courses to sit for the exam (hence ""Comprehensive."")

It's my understanding that the first administration was in June 1937 and included the note:

> The minimum time requirement [for taking this exam] is 10 periods a week for three school years with outside preparation and home project work. These three years of work must include homemaking B and D.

The exam was broken into multiple parts and the first question on Part I, section III of the 1937 exam question read:

> Suppose that you intend to invite five friends for supper, and the evening on Sunday, July 7
> 
> a. Write your part of a telephone conversation inviting one of these friends. [3 points]
> 
> b You have decided to serve a buffet supper. Write the menu for it. [5 points]
> 
> c State your plan for the entertainment of the guests. [2 points]

So we know that from the beginning, Homemaking teachers thought teaching young women how to entertain was important. However, the exams weren't just about entertaining - there were questions about taxes (T/F: Assessments for taxation purposes are divided equally among all the houses in a locality.) child safety (T/F: Instinct teaches a mother how to care for her baby. False. FYI.), food safety (The growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds cause the ___ of food.), etc.

I don't have access to any of the exams from the 1940s but questions about entertaining appear on the 1950 exam:

> Part II, Question 1: Part of a home experience might be assuming responsibility for preparing dinner for a family of four and two guests. A girl might choose the following menu:
> 
> tomato juice
> broiled steak
> mashed potatoes
> buttered peas
> molded fruit salad
> baking-powder biscuits
> butter
> chocolate cake
> coffee
> milk
> A. Consider all duties involved in preparing this meal. List four duties which might be done the night before, showing good management of time.

Which is to say: if the calendar in the kitchen is to be believed, Mr. Hart, Vision's boss was coming for dinner on Wednesday, August 23, 1950, 1961, or 1967.

AskHistorians,"Until the presidency of Andrew Jackson, the US federal government considered the ""American Indian"" nations to be independent foreign nations. That being the case, wouldn't the US government's seizure of Native American lands have violated international law, such as the Treaty of Westphalia (1648)?","##Part 1

This will be a challenge. I just taught a 10-week course about American Indian treaties that essentially covered this very question. I'm going to try to wrap up all that discourse into several comments...as much as I am able to, at least.

___

This is a really good question and one that spans quite a few years in between the Peace of Westphalia (in which multiple treaties were signed) and the Indian removal era under Andrew Jackson. During this time, there were major developments in European legal theory that shaped how the colonizing nations viewed Indigenous Peoples and how these theories led to the justification of land dispossession for Native Nations. These theories came to dominant the way Indigenous Peoples would be perceived in the past and continued to shape the way Tribes are understood with the modern U.S. legal framework today. To really answer this question, we must break it down and understand some key themes.

###Concepts of Sovereignty

Key to understanding how Indigenous Peoples were perceived by European nations is dissecting the concept of sovereignty. [I've touched on this aspect in the past where I elaborate how sovereignty was indeed part of the political thoughts of Indigenous Nations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6setwq/was_sovereignty_a_part_of_native_american/dlmfl6p/) Tribes operated as polities long before Europeans arrived in the Americas and continued to do so long after Europeans decided to stay. Historically, it is significant to this answer to note that when Europeans arrived, they were much more inclined to respect Indigenous ways of politics and even act according to them.

**European Sovereignty**

European conceptualizations of sovereignty existed well before the Peace of Westphalia, but it was this event in 1648 that many scholars, particularly political scientists and international law experts, point to as the birth of the framework for international relations. There is some debate here as to whether this event really meant all that much for the creation of a concrete definition of sovereignty because the actual treaties that were signed have little to do with the concept of sovereignty and rather the extolling of the Peace of Westphalia relies on a 19th Century-onward fixation on the sovereignty. Regardless of how some scholars feel about this, though, there is no doubt that the Peace of Westphalia, whether the myth or the actual precedents set forth in the event, had a major impact on how the Western world understands sovereignty. It gave rise to the Westphalian model of sovereignty that promotes the exclusive authority of a state over its territory and asserts a non-interference principle with the affairs of other recognized states. It is from this model that we derive many modern definitions of sovereignty and with it several distinct characteristics that reveal how European nations construed the exercising of sovereignty, particular viewing sovereignty as an expression of the state:

* ""Supreme authority in a state. In any state sovereignty is vested in the institution, person, or body having the ultimate authority to impose law on everyone else in the state."" -- [Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100520397)

* The psosession of sovereign power; supreme political authority, paramount control of the construction and frame of government and its administration..."" -- [Black's Law Dictionary](https://thelawdictionary.org/sovereignty/)

* ""The state is the form of human community that (successfully) lays claim to the monopoly on legitimate physical violence."" -- Max Weber, 1919 (Levy & Sznaider, 2006, p. 660).

From here, we can deduce that the Westphalian mode of sovereignty, at least in the eyes of Europeans, was meant to encompass the ideas of power, exclusivity, supremacy, legitimacy, territoriality, and absolute rule. Even today, sovereignty is readily recognized as the power of a polity to exercise its will and command autonomy. These elements are what characterized the motivations of European nations when it came to diminishing the sovereignty of Indigenous Peoples, a concept that was not interpreted in quite the same way.

**An Indigenous Form of Sovereignty**

Because there are many, many, MANY different Indigenous Nations, it is hard to articulate a model that captures the diversity among our nations. It is even more difficult to do so when historicizing the discussion around a time when Native Nations were much less encumbered by colonial states. As my previous answer indicates, Indigenous scholars include cultural and spiritual aspects to Indigenous models of sovereignty, contrasting it with the often strictly political and secular notions of international relations between states (yes, European kingdoms with monarchs believed their rulers were divinely appointed, we'll get to that later). Despite these differences, when observing commonalities on a political level, we can pull out some defining aspects that would have contrasted themselves with European values to devise general constructs of Indigenous forms of government. Wilkins and Stark (2017) list these as:^1

* Use of kinship systems in forming the basic social building block for larger institutions (economic, political, etc.)
* Respect for individual/personal autonomy
* An emotional-spiritual-physical connection to one's traditional territory
* Rare separation of political and spiritual worldviews
* Vesting sovereignty in the community--the collective of people--and not strictly in appointed leaders
* Inclusion of women who often held positions of significant influence
* Operating the government in a more judicial manner than as a legislative body

From these aspects, we can build the following model of sovereignty that relies on the principles of identity, integrity, spirituality, relationality, power, and community. The obvious contrast here is enough to see how conflict would be bred between Tribes and colonizing European nations.

We are also actually able to derive an understanding of how these characteristics manifested in Indigenous forms of sovereignty and how they would clash with the emerging dominant European model. One way we can do this is by looking at treaty documents and the records of the treaty-making process between early colonists and Indigenous Nations, ""for any discussion of American government must be based on the fact that native peoples inhabited this hemisphere before the European invasion. Originally, North Americans dealt with indigenous peoples as sovereignty nations by signing formal treaties with them"" (Wilmer et al, 1994, as cited in Wilkins & Stark, 2017).

This fact is readily apparent when observing the interactions between the early colonists of North America and the very present Indigenous Nations there, most notably the Powhatan Confederacy. I comment heavily on this in the second part of my earlier answer, relying on the source *Paper Sovereigns: Anglo-Native Treaties and the Law of Nations, 1604-1664* by Jeffrey Glover (2014). Even the introduction to this book is incredibly insightful as it connects the major themes wrapped up in your main question. Pulling in documents from Gabriel Archer, the official Recorder of the Virginia Colony, we get a powerful glimpse into the interactions between Jamestown and their Native neighbors, specifically the Powhatans. I won't take the time to reiterated that previous answer I linked above, but suffice to say, Europeans submitted themselves to the political traditions of Tribal Nations to forge new relationships in the wake of early colonization. Though there was an obvious practical reason for this (their literal survival lest they incur the ire of the powerful nations at their doorstep, as what nearly happened on several occasion when social faux pas were committed), there were also some underlying philosophical perspectives being developed under emerging international legal theories that led either to the acceptance, rejection, or a mild intrigue of Indigenous nationhood in the eyes of Europeans."
AskHistorians,"Ancient Rome offered its conquered subjects a ""good deal"": We'll give you ports, roads, sewers, aqueducts, hook you into our wealth-building global trade network, and defend you. All we ask is that you say a prayer for our emperor once in awhile and pay your taxes. How onerous was that tax burden?","The notion that ""Rome"" built aqueducts, sewers, ports, etc is problematic in the academic sense because it isn't entirely wrong, nor is it entirely misleading, but it does not really capture the full picture. To illustrate this I will copy out here Pliny's letter to the emperor Trajan regarding some public works in the city of Nicomedia, and Trajan's response (translation taken [from here](http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny10a.html#37):

>To Trajan.

>Sir, the people of Nicomedia spent 3,329,000 sesterces upon an aqueduct, which was left in an unfinished state, and I may say in ruin, and they also levied taxes to the extent of two millions for a second one. This too has been abandoned, and to obtain a water-supply those who have wasted these enormous sums must go to new expense. I have myself visited a splendidly clear spring, from which it seems to me the supply ought to be brought to the town as indeed they tried to do by their first scheme - by an aqueduct of arches, so that it might not be confined only to the low-lying and level parts of the city. Very few of the arches are still standing; some could be built from the shaped blocks {lapis quadratus} which were taken from the earlier work, and part again, in my opinion, should be constructed of brick {opus testaceum}, which is both cheaper and more easily handled, but the first thing that might be done is for you to send an engineer skilled in such work, or an architect, to prevent a repetition of the former failures. I can at least vouch for this, that such an undertaking would be well worthy of your reign owing to its public utility and its imposing design.

>Trajan to Pliny.

>Steps must certainly be taken to provide the city of Nicomedia with a water-supply, and I have every confidence that you will undertake the duty with all necessary diligence. But I swear that it is also part of your diligent duty to find out who is to blame for the waste of such sums of money by the people of Nicomedia on their aqueducts, and whether or not there has been any serving of private interests in thus beginning and then abandoning the works. See that you bring to my knowledge whatever you may find out.

From one perspective this is a classic example of ""Romans building an aqueduct"" as here we have the governor of Bithynia sending a letter to the emperor asking for assistance and technical expertise, and the emperor responding favorably with instructions to oversee the project and investigate what went wrong with the prior attempts. And it is by no means alone in that, if you read through the letters you get the sense that supervising public works was a pretty major part of the job of provincial administration. However, the letter also points to something strikingly different: these were public works projects that were initiated by local political unites and funded by taxes raised by those units for the purpose, with ""Rome"" being essentially a mere consultant to the process and it seems imperial officials did not even know about it until they physically went to the city.

So how do we talk about the aqueduct of Nicomedia? Was it Roman? It was constructed during the period of the Roman empire, with techniques used throughout the empire, and eventually drawing on empire wide networks of expertise. That's pretty Roman! But it was also about as far from ""the Romans"" coming into a place and building an aqueduct as can be imagined. There is not really a wrong answer to that, and it all depends on your perspective and what about the Roman empire you want to focus on.

The bit about taxes also relates to your question, because it is not the case that Joeius Publicus was filling out his VV-II on the Ides of April to pay his taxes. Taxes during the Early Imperial Period (when a more formalized system than the wildcat days of Republican tax farming was implemented) were assessed by imperial officials but actually levied by local government bodies on land, property, commerce, professional revenue, etc, and sent up the chain to speak, so there was not a centralized government agency. As for how burdensome taxation was, the sources are mixed. Tax revolt and protest crops up less than in, say, Chinese imperial history, but that could easily be a case of vastly different quality and quantity of source material, and I have personally seen different people characterize Roman taxation as surprisingly light or quite burdensome. Without documentation we do not have it is very hard to give a full answer. In the very recent *Taxation, Economy, and Revolt in Ancient Rome, Galilee, and Egypt*, the historian David Hollander summarizes the different sides of the argument and gives his own characterization of the taxation system as being ""opaque, inconsistent, and unfair"" which crucially is not the same thing as burdensome.

[There is also a historical mention of a general, I believe it was Quintus Flaminius, boasting that after conquering Greece (?) the new subjects actually paid less in taxation than they did before. The general theory being that while the Roman empire had a much larger and costlier military than any other Mediterranean polity, it was significantly less than the total combined military spending of the previously existing polities, and thus represented a much smaller portion of the ""Mediterranean GDP"" so to speak. However I cannot for the life of me remember who it was so I am keeping this in a sidenote]"

AskHistorians,"The letter ""J"" didn't exist in English until 1633. Shakespeare died in 1616. What was Juliet's real name?","First off, it's a detail, but your datation is slightly wrong: 1633 was when Charles Butler's *The English Grammar, or The Institution of Letters, Syllables and Words, in the English tongue* was published, and while this grammar book is indeed the first to theorize a distinction in writing between <*i>* and <*j>* in English, it was not the first instance of that distinction being systematically made: that honor belongs to the King James Bible.

As a general rule, the important thing to keep in mind is that (most of the time at least!) grammar books are descriptive tools. They analyze what already exists in the language since a while. It's not as if Butler suddenly invented a sound that no-one was using before and it magically made its way overnight in the way English people spoke.

The second little misconception in your question seems to be that you assume that there's only one way to pronounce <*j*\> in modern English (""the same J sound that we'd recognize""), as an equivalent of a <*dg*\> (as in ""hedge""), but that's not entirely true either. You don't pronounce the <*j*\> in ""Hallelujah"", or in ""Taj Mahal"", the same way you do in ""Juliet"", for instances.

With all that in mind, while the title of the play in the First Folio reads ""THE TRAGEDIE OF ROMEO AND IVLET"", the actor playing Romeo in 1600 would have pronounced the name of his star-crossed lover the same way we do.

It's not that this was a ""blind spot in the written language"" nor a matter of ""accuracy"" (is the use of <*j*\> somehow more accurate in Juliet than in Hallelujah?), just that it was the use since Middle English to write <*i*\> that particular sound when it was at the initial of the word specifically, instead of the Old English form that was written <*cᵹ*\>, and later that specific use shifted to <*j*\> instead. It's purely a matter of written convention.

You'll note that even in modern English, the words where a <*j*\> appears at another position than the initial are most often either clear borrowings from another language, that have been transposed without much change, or pronounced differently than initial <*j*\>... or both.

As an aside, in that same First Folio of the play, you'll find that where you'd expect a <*v*\> in the middle of a word it is written <*u*\>, while where you would expect a <*u*\> specifically at the initial of a word it's written <*v*\>. For instance. Does it mean that the actors pronounced ""vp"" instead of ""up"", or didn't make the distinction between the initial sounds in ""up"" and ""Verona"", nor the distinction between the sounds in ""lovely"" and ""Capulet""? No. Again, purely a matter of written conventions."

AskHistorians,I am the lowest ranking international master at Chess in 2020. I wake up and find myself in the 1920's chess scene. What am I able to revolutionize in theory?,"Here is a [paper](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/papers/pdf/Reg12IPRs.pdf) by Ken Regan which does statistical analysis comparing players/tournaments of the past to today.

For example, by his analysis, the famous tournament New York 1927 had a intrinsic rating of 2579, compared to top tournaments of today that have intrinsic ratings of generally in the mid 2700s. (So you can sorta think of the intrinsic rating as well calibrated to actual ratings of today -- since most of the top grandmasters are rated in the mid-high 2700s.)

So I think it's fair to say that if we took the *worst* International Master in the world, who likely would have a FIDE rating of something in the 2100-2300 range -- probably because they are old or got their IM title in an unusual way like winning a world youth tournament -- then they would not be competitive for the world title or in top tournaments in the 1920s. (Taking the top end of that range, a 2300 would be expected to score 25% against a 2500, so it's clear that they would not have hopes of being very competitive in New York 1927 or other top events of the day).

As for the related question about theory, I imagine almost all strong chess players today could contribute a lot to opening theory in the 1920s (at least to the openings they play and remember the analysis of!). That is almost certainly the area of the game that has been most revolutionized by computers -- since top players are generally rattling off 10-30 moves of the engine's best lines. It's worth noting that 2020 is an interesting time to place this question, since engines were undergoing a massive improvement in strength and insight due to new neural networks (originally pioneered by DeepMind's AlphaZero). Engines were going from extremely superhuman to absurdly superhuman -- and probably closer to the latter by 2020.

For reference, the top engine of 2020, Stockfish 11, [had an estimated rating somewhere in the 3500-3600 range](http://www.cegt.net/40_4_Ratinglist/40_4_AllVersion/rangliste.html). So it is absurdly better than the best humans ever (who have maxed out in the mid 2800s). It's not even in the same league. Any analysis that our hypothetical time traveler remember would almost certainly affect opening theory substantially. Of course, it would likely be limited to those variations that the player actually played and knew.

Even the variations they didn't play, they would know which lines are considered best by the engines and top players of 2020, which they would quite possibly share with other players who would perform their own analysis. For example, I consider it very likely that the [Berlin Variation of the Ruy Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Defence_\(chess\)), nowadays considered best play for both sides by [many top engines](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2206625119) would likely come back into fashion sooner if there was a time traveler in the scene. 

If you are interested in more about how engines have revolutionized chess, I can highly recommend the books and youtube videos of Matthew Sadler, Game Changer (with coauthor Natasha Regan) and The Silicon Road to Chess Improvement."
AskHistorians,"The Rubicon River is one of the most famous in history because Julius Caesar started a civil war when he crossed it. ""Crossing the Rubicon"" now means to do something you can't take back. So how did we manage to lose the Rubicon River? Why don't we know where it is?","""Why don't we know where it is"" isn't a question that's possible to answer.  Why don't we have Sulla's autobiography?  Why did Cicero's *de rei publica* survive only as a palimpsest only rediscovered in the 1800s, while his *de legibus* has a healthy manuscript tradition?

There's just no way to explain these kinds of things.

There is one point though.  Caesar did not start the war.

The future of Caesar's possible run for consul came up in the spring of 50 BCE.  The law of the Ten Tribunes, which was passed by popular vote, allowed Caesar to stand in absentia for consul when his 10 year term expired.

The consuls Marcellus and Paullus blocked this, and a series of negotiations started that would last just about a year.

The senate met early in 50 to discuss the next governor of Gaul, and Pompey proposed removing Caesar before the start of the new year.

Caesar's ally Curio, a tribune, vetoed this.  Curio then countered with the proposal that both Pompey and Caesar surrender their commands, a position Caesar endorsed.  This passed the senate 370-22, but Marcellus, the consul, refused to record the vote.

Caesar tried another route, and suggested both he and Pompey lay down their commands, and submit to the judgment of the people, taking the issue out of the senate.  This was also rejected.

Marcellus proposed another measure demanding Caesar abandon his command, and this time it passed, but was vetoed by Antony and Cassius.  At this point Antony and Cassius were very, very illegally driven out of the senate, and went to meet Caesar in Ravenna.  This action is one of the casus belli Caesar discusses in his commentaries.

Somehow, a false rumor that Caesar had invaded Italy popped up, the senate designated him an enemy of the state, and Marcellus put a sword in Pompey's hand and asked him to do what was necessary.

The senate declared war on Caesar, not the other way around.  As a matter of fact, until Pompey evacuated to Greece, Caesar was constantly sending messages asking for a conference to settle things without further conflict.

Now, back to the Rubicon.

There is no contemporary reference to Caesar crossing the Rubicon.  The first reference to the Rubicon only shows up in Cicero's Philippics, after Caesar's assassination, and it's in reference to Antony going *north*.  He was going to take command of Gaul and Cicero was terrified of this and tried to get a senatus consultum preventing him from taking his troops over the river.

The first association of Caesar and the Rubicon is Paterculus, writing under Tiberius, who places almost no importance on the river at all.

The story we know only popped up in Lucan's epic poem about the Civil War, written under Nero, some 100 years after the events it describes.

Does that explain why we don't know where it is?  No, but it suggests the importance of crossing the Rubicon is a later creation, and didn't matter much to people of Caesar's generation."
AskHistorians,Ireland had a huge population in 1821 relative to its size — 6.8 million. Egypt only had only 4.3 million. Scotland: 2.1 million. Austria 3.1 million. USA 9.1 million.

The problem is, there's some retro-fitting of history at play here; ""Ireland's population is small *now,* so why was it larger *then?""* 

Historically, Ireland was the second most fertile and second most populous region of these isles by a considerable distance. Unlike Scotland and Wales, which were overwhelmingly mountainous, Ireland was a country of low hills, meadows and farmlands, just as England was. For comparison to the countries you listed, Egypt is [96% desert.](https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt/Agriculture-and-fishing) Austria is [60% high mountain.](https://www.bmeia.gv.at/oev-wien/about-austria/geography/#:~:text=Approximately%2060%20percent%20of%20Austrian,Austria%2C%20north%20of%20the%20Danube.)

The US, while extremely fertile, wasn't even 50 years old.
Ireland did not have any of these problems - much like England it was a country of low hills, meadows and farmlands and was extremely arable. As we can see from a glance, [England's population for the period was about 15 million,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_England) significantly higher than any of the countries you listed. France, for example, had many times more again [at about 35 million for the period.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1009279/total-population-france-1700-2020/) In fact, rather than what your question suggests, [Ireland's population size was bang on the money for a largely arable country that was undergoing industrialization.](https://external-preview.redd.it/AtkyVmB1-Xe_2HEiVNzLyZoIme7Y5xAUgNGAeUrJdP8.png?auto=webp&s=21d701c5a115dde7c7c0f7a6f03390c68389e362) In fact, we have several examples of less-arable countries [which adopted industrialization later than Ireland but which maintained their population growth and whose modern day populations are significantly higher.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea) 

Generally speaking, the more important question is ""why did Ireland's population decline?""

Cicero paid a million sestertii for one, — enough to purchase a huge estate. What was so special about these tables? What started the craze? Why were they so expensive?","While im sure that the tables where of good quality and had many merits and excellent craftmanship that is not the point. As in most things about Roman Elite its about image. Its to display wealth and to be ostentatious with a piece of art. The term you used mensarum insania comes from Pliny the Elder Natural History (13.29). But there are so much more outrageous examples that exists across Roman history.

Some examples are Pompey having a portrait of himself made out of pearls (Plin. Nat. 37.15) for his triumph after he defeats Mithridates.

Pliny also recounts the story of Cleopatra dissolving pearls worth 10 millions sesterces in vinegar to win a bet against Marc Anthony that she could spend that much money in a single dinner. (Plin. Nat. 9.58). Horace has a similar story about the son of an actor dissolving a pearl in vinegar and then drinking it.  (Horace. Serm. 2.3.). It is also recounted in Valeri Maximi *Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium.* Caligula later does it as well and boasts that you can either be economical or Caesar (Caligula. 37).

Note that most modern authors usually dismiss those stories as wives tales. Pearls need to boil for quite some time in vinegar to dissolve. So please do not try this at home.

Then back to your passage about the ""mensarum insania"" what I would say is important about that passage is the remark Pliny has about Cicero in which he says he paid no less than one million sesterces *despite his moderate means*. (Plin. Hist 13.29). For context, Orators weren't supposed to be paid due to the *Lex Cincia* in his (Cicero) days but of course they had ways to circumvent that. (Cic. *Orat.* 2.71). The passage about the table and its price is a dig on Cicero who should not have had the means to spend that much on a table.

Many writers from Cato the Elder onwards considered those sort of ostentatious behavior a major threat to Rome’s dominance and a proof of moral degeneracy. Laws sometimes came up to limit those expenses by the elite but from the perpetual writings of Roman authors to critisize such lavish expenses we can be sure that they kept on happening despite the warnings and constant comments from Roman authors on the hypocrisy and vanity of an elite class in perpetual decline.  During the principate where the concentration of power became even more extreme than during the late republic those kind of expenses are really not that uncommon. Though it is not current nowadays historians at the start of the 20th century liked to propose that this ""moral degeneracy"" was one of the main cause of the collapse of the Roman Empire.

As to the start of the craze It is hard to pinpoint when the taste for the ""finer"" things in life would have swept its way in the roman elite. Good suspects would be as early as the 3rd and 2nd century BC during the Macedonian Wars and contacts with Greek culture and later on the integration of Asia in the Roman sphere of influence."
AskHistorians,What major events in the history of labor in the United States (or globally) would you teach to a class of union construction workers?,"My area of expertise is not specifically on labor and unions, but I would like to make the case for talking about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City in 1911, which ultimately killed 146 people. Most of the deceased were the young female immigrants employed by the factory. The following are a synopsis of the relevant events:

* A fire broke out in the 8th floor of a garment factory in New York. All there was to suppress the fire were a few buckets of water, and it quickly spread throughout the floor and to the two higher floors. 
* The main reason so many people died was due to inadequate exits. The main entrances to each floor were locked to prevent theft, which left external fire escapes, the elevators, and one other internal staircase for emergency egress.The fire escapes were not strong enough to sustain the exodus from the building and collapsed, possibly additionally weakened from the heat of the fire.  The elevator operators ran the elevators as long as possible (one only stopped running when the cables broke and the elevator freefell half the building's height). The internal staircase quickly became a crush of people trying to escape. When fire engines arrived, their ladders only reached the sixth floor and many of the victims chose to jump to their deaths from the windows rather than succumb to the flames.
*  Several unions (International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, Womens' Trade Union League) had been fighting for better working conditions prior to the fire but had little luck. Following the fire, the former organized a large protest to demand reforms, while the latter organized a massive funeral procession.
* Public opinion forced the New York state legislature to form the Factory Investigation Commission, which made recommendations that lead to 25 new bills regarding workplace safety and strengthened the power of the Department of Labor.
* The two owners of the factory were found not guilty of manslaughter for locking the stairwells of the factory. They were later found liable in a wrongful death suit and ordered to pay $75 for each victim. They received about $400 for each victim from their insurance company. 
* In 1913 one of the owners was caught locking his employees in at a different factory and was fined $25, the judge for the case apologized for having to levy the fine.

Why this event is noteworthy and should be talked about in your class:

* It is a classic example of what tragedies may occur when profits are held higher than human safety, and following the fire the unions were instrumental in gaining advances in workplace safety. 
* The owners suffered almost no consequencies; while it's difficult to imagine this today, there is a parallel in individuals avoiding blame and allowing a corporation to take the fall.
* Horrific factory fires and lock-ins are still happening. The Hamlet Chicken Processing Plant fire in 2003 and the Karachi Baldia Town factory (Pakistan) in 2015 are examples of fires which had greater casualties due to locked doors/ windows. Walmart in 2003 was accused of locking in workers, as was Target in 2013. OSHA and other safety agencies are great in theory but are often underfunded and understaffed, so inspections may only happen if there's a complaint. Unfortunately it's up to the workers themselves to ensure that they are safe.

AskHistorians,Provoked by a conversation with my five year old… what was the first “Country”?,"This question is interesting!  It very much depends on how you define a country.  As far as i can determine, there are three operative definitions but within those definitions, you can also argue whether a country must have existed if we have archaeological records of civilization and what exactly constitutes a record ie. do we only consider written records, lists of kings and the like or is oral tradition sufficient.  What about legends?

That said, the definitions I think we could use are:

1. A civilization occupying a defined area
2. A defined area ruled by a single government
3. A defined area ruled by a single government that has self-sovreignty

As you can see, there is a progression of sorts in the evolution of a country from a city-state through a loose country to a nation which guarantees its own borders.  While, it has become the norm to refer to native populations as First Nations (this is a common term in USA and Australia), it is difficult to apply the term ""country"" to those tribes as they were, to greater or lesser degree, nomadic.  

However, if you believe that the term country does apply in this situation, the various tribes native to the country we now call Australia (and specifically the island now known as Tasmania - the Palawa tribe) have an oral history tradition stretching back over 40,000 years and are very much a contender for oldest country.  Certainly there is evidence that those tribes recorded events such as volcanic eruptions which have been dated to that period.  I am not aware of any tribes which claim an older oral history and, of course, there are no written records.

The oldest non-nomadic civilization was founded in the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern day Iraq.  The Mesopotamian civilization, specifically the Sumerian civilization arose perhaps as early as the 5th millennium BC and was definitely established by the 4th millennium BC.  The difficulty in calling Sumer a country though is that the Nam-Lugal ""Kingship' list shows that many of the cities within Sumer each had their own ruler and there is no over-arching system of government.  So, if you wanted to call a city-state a country, then Eridu of ancient Sumer dates to approximately 5400 BC.

The issue with the paragraph above is that there is archeological evidence that towns and cities were established in Mesopotamia, China and India thousands of years (~7th millennium BC) before Eridu.  We only refer to Eridu because it's the oldest city we have a written record of.  So, Eridu is almost certainly not the first country, it's just the first city-state we have a name for.

Now, if you are looking at countries that had a central government then the Elam nation in western Iran was formed in approximately 3200 BC by the merging of Anshan, Awan, and Shimashki as well as perhaps other city-states whose names have been lost.  If you consider this to be a country, and you can certainly make the case for it as it ruled an area beyond the immediate confines of its major towns then Elam in modern day Iran is the oldest in the world.  Hot on its heels, of course, is Egypt which unified the Lower and Upper Egypt in about 3150 BC under the First Dynasty.  Either of these examples are unambiguously countries and are what I would consider the real answer to your question.

Both modern day Iran and Egypt are much larger than the civilizations discussed above though which means that your second question on which country is the oldest in recognisable form is probably not either of them.

So which country is the oldest?  Probably Japan.  Japanese history claims that Emperor Jimmu was the first ruler of the Yamatai kingdom founded (and this is oddly specific) 11 Feb 660 BC.  Given that Japan has had a continuous imperial dynasty since that date, I would offer Japan as the contender for the oldest recognisable country even though the exact region of the Yamatai kingdom is unknown today.

However, you could argue that the Qin dynasty (for which modern China is named) which traces its roots to the 9th century BC represents the oldest country with self-sovreignty.  I would disagree with the claim though as the Qin dynasty only formally arose in 221 BC (after centuries of conquest) as an imperial power and fell in 206 BC  China's history is one of dynastic rule interspersed with periods of unrest and war.  So while China as a nation certainly began with the Qin dynasty, it did not remain a unified nation throughout its history so I don't believe that it satisfies the criteria.

In summary, as an answer for a 5 year old, I would say Iran or Egypt is the oldest country.  I leave it to you how to answer the inevitable ""But why?""."
AskHistorians,Why did the surname of Mussolini not fall out of favor in Italy the way that Hitler did in Germany?,[removed]
AskHistorians,How did Native Americans survive extreme winters?,"It bears repeating that Native Americans were not monolithic. The differences in the methodology, philosophies, and technologies of different tribes and regions cannot be overstated. So with that, I can't speak to what midwest, east coast, or southeastern Natives did to navigate cold weather. I can tell you about some strategies in the southwest and Rockies, however. 

What many people don't know about arid and semi-arid deserts is that for all of their punishing heat in the day, they also become painfully cold at night. And at elevation, winter can be even more punishing in the desert than in the woods. So in places like northern New Mexico, the Pecos people would build kivas - underground dwellings in the thick clay and limestone ubiquitous to the area. While it is true that the subterranean earth itself is cold, it also insulates extremely well. So with a fire inside of these structures which amounted basically to giant, singular rooms, heat would be reflected and trapped very well. The Pecos people would build ventilation to allow fires to breath and exhaust properly, while using hatching over the ladders to seal out the elements when inside. If you'd like to see one in person, you can climb down in at the Pecos National Historic Park just east of Santa Fe. 

If we move over to northern Arizona (sitting atop the Colorado Plateau at well over 7K feet in many places), we will find that the Dine (Navajo) peoples utilized the same principles, only above ground. Hogans are large, circular structures consisting also of basically one giant room. Combinations of wood and soil are used to craft the walls and seal them to the elements. They typically utilize a chimney and fireplace, with a more modern standing door for entry and exiting. 

Moving north into Utah you can find the Ancestral Puebloans (often referred to as Anasazi, although that comes with a tribal connotation from the Dine, and is not well-regarded). They often utilized small apartment-style pueblos. These were often cut back in the sandstone, and are marvels of engineering, considering the lack of modern tools and measurement devices. Other times, they'd be built out on the plain or at the feet of natural landmarks. They are multi-level often times, and also served as fortifications against raiding tribes due to their firm clay or sandstone structure and complexity. You can see these at a variety of locations, the most famous being in Colorado at Mesa Verde.

Now then, knowing that the structures were well-insulated and ahead of their time, what then of staying warm when outside? If we go up into Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, we can take cues from the Shoshone, Blackfeet, and Crow peoples. Before industrial hunting wiped the western US' ecology out, bison, elk, and deer were plentiful. In addition, keen and quick hunters could track down black or brown bears and moose. All of these animals are extremely hardy in cold weather, so their skins and pelts make for excellent furs and materials for boots, pants, and coats. On the famous Meriweather Lewis and William Clark hunt for a route from the Missouri to the Pacific, the two leaders and Charbonneau traded often for furs and pelts from the peoples along the Snake River and upper Missouri. As the expedition halted for winters, these clothing articles proved invaluable to the Virginians and their party who were unaccustomed to the extreme winds and cold snaps of the northern Rockies.

AskHistorians,"How musty and stinky were 1800s ballroom parties? All those layers, no air conditioning, dancing, cramped space, etc. Were there any common counter measures if it was an issue?","I am a cultural historian (primarily an art historian) with some background in the nineteenth century and while I certainly do not specialize in this particular arena, I was curious so I did some research. I welcome amendments!! 

A lot of historians have actually written histories of smell! I’ll leave a bibliography at the end. It seems like ideas about smell changed a lot over the course of the 19th century, but smell remained a huge concern throughout. Crowds were associated with stench in places like theaters and operas, “where,” as the French author Senancour wrote in 1804, “the breath of two thousand bodies, whose cleanliness and wholesomeness are to a greater or lesser degree suspect, makes you sweat all over.”  Indeed, the smell of crowded places was occasionally so offensive that it compelled spectators to abandon the opera. Another publication from later in the century complained of the stench emanating from “unwashed feet and hose” of urban crowds, even from surprisingly “very decent-looking and perhaps elegantly-dressed people.” This observed poor hygiene, ultimately, would “assist in diffusing an odor that would unsettle the stomach of any not bred in a slaughterhouse.” 

Ballrooms, of course, were one place where crowds congregated, and were thus subject to predictable concerns about overheating and the putrid odor of perspiration. One publication from 1856, for instance, complained of a ballroom that “reeked with an atmosphere poisoned with a thousand breaths, the hot odors of the gas lamps, the expiring perfumes left by scented handkerchiefs, the limp bouquets, and the aromatic fans that had waved and fluttered incessantly for he last four hours.” Across Google books from before 1900, there are frequent descriptions of other foul smells in ballrooms, such as the scents of old tobacco smoke, whiskey, paint (does anyone know why?) or proximity to barn animals (this also seems weird, but i read somewhere that some barn animals were sometimes thought to ward off bad smells— can anyone confirm?).

One thing that makes me think that the ballroom was likely better than other crowded places is that ballroom etiquette seems to have taken smell really seriously, partly as a function of class: throughout the nineteenth century, hygiene and olfactory discernment were increasingly associated with pedigree and refinement. One nineteenth century guidebook cautioned that “No man is so well looking and fascinating that, on entering a ballroom, he can afford to handicap himself with a stink.” By the late nineteenth century, books frequently spoke to the importance of proper hygiene in ballroom settings. And there was always the risk of a dizzying volume or overabundance of perfume: indeed, nineteenth century authors frequently evoked the image of an unwanted suitor by describing his overpowering musk: a rejected dancing partner, for instance, might be described as emanating one of the “worst abominations of perfumery.” 

In terms of counter-measures, there were a ton, in fact! I’ll start with the biggest one, which was perfume. For hundreds of years, it was assumed that good smells would drive out bad smells. Courts had professional perfumers, and potpourri was imagined to drive away rank odors. I’m sure you can think of many people for whom this belief has never really gone away! Fumigation, mainly by pouring vinegar onto something really hot, also persisted as a method with which to drive out smells into the mid nineteenth century. Yet the real progress happened with the advent of things like ventilation and proper hygiene. Ventilation as a response to bad smell had been around since at least the 17th century, but increased in technical efficacy dramatically throughout the nineteenth century. In 1870, Henry Albert Gouge touted his “new system of ventilation” which promised a house “entirely free of bad odors.” The other thing that seems to have helped was germ theory, hygiene, and the concept of disinfection: a guide book from 1886 suggested that “unpleasant odors” “may be removed by the following simple process: mix a tablespoonful of the compound spirits of ammonia with a small basin of water. By washing the arms, armpits, and hands with the solution, the skin will be left clean and sweet. The wash is cheap and harmless, and is much preferable to the perfumes and unguents which disguise but do not relieve the trouble.” As this text suggests, germ theory instilled the notion that hygiene could ward off bad smells effectively. So too does it suggest that there was, finally, the simple desire to not scare off a potential suitor with too much perfume, which guarded against the possibility of a ballroom rank with manufactured aromas.

AskHistorians,"When castles were attacked in the Middle Ages, were the peasants on the land attacked too, or left alone?","Side note: most of the examples and sources I am going to be citing are from the Holy Roman Empire in the Late Middle Ages, as this is my area of expertise, but the general principles are true for most of the European Middle Ages. I will also talk about the symbolic implications of plundering, as the specifics of how plundering worked are usually glossed over by chroniclers  


PART 1/2  
Yes, they absolutely would be attacked. Their specific fate depended on a variety of circumstances, including how the raiders were feeling that day, but peasants  
were seen as valid targets in warfare. After all, peasants were producing the food that kept the enemy army fed, therefore they were considered legitimate targets, if not outright enemy combatants. People living near castles were kinda lucky, as they could flee behind the walls. Most peasants would be raided without warning, however. Raiding the countryside was a very common part of medieval warfare – most historians now think it was actually more common than actual battles or sieges. However, medieval chroniclers would often rather write about those battles, as they were seen as more impactful and relevant than the day-to-day raiding business, even though this “small war” was a very integral part of medieval warfare.


As a nobleman going to war, you didn’t just raid the countryside to get loot or damage your enemy’s economy though. Put yourself in the shoes of some local lord. You’ve just received a letter announcing your neighbour’s intention to start a feud over that one piece of land you two have been squabbling about. So, you call your friends, your vassals, levies etc., gather your supplies and hole up in your castle. Now your neighbour lord will have to invest considerable amounts of time and manpower to get you out - time he may not have. So, all’s well for you, right? Well, now your countryside is largely unprotected – but that’s fine, right? A few villages getting burned is sure bad and is going to hurt your economy, but your army is safe and intact, your granaries are full and safe behind your castle’s wall. And then your enemy denounces you as a coward for not defending your country. And then two of your men-at-arms ask you what happened to the oath you took as the liege of this country – the oath in which you swore to protect the lands from harm.  


Chroniclers often use descriptions of looting and plundering to indicate that a foe is defeated.  
The logic being if you can plunder without anyone hindering you then you must have won. So, just the fact that your neighbour has looted your lands can already be used by him to claim victory over you. And now your vassals start getting demoralized since, well, the enemy can just burn down our lands with impunity – have we  
been defeated? Plundering and raiding are thus not only methods of economic warfare but were also seen as a symbolic signifier for victory.  


We do not know a lot about what actually went down during those lootings, as most chroniclers usually just write “Lord X came to the lands of Lord Y and burned down villages, looted the countryside and took the cattle.” Looting and plundering was considered such a normal part of war, most chroniclers wouldn’t even bother mentioning it. One chronicler, Ludwig von Eyb the Younger, who chronicled the life of German knight Wilwolt von Schaumberg at one point straight up says he doesn’t want to describe the minutia of looting and the “small war” as that would just bore his readers:   


“Nichtsdesterweniger ward zw bayden tayllen vill reütterey getribenn, stett eingenommen, fleckenn vnnd dorffer gebucht, geplundert, gebrennt, das vich genomen, reyssig vnd zwfus, wie den das kriegs siett, nyder geworffenn, gefanngen, gegen einander wider ledig gelassenn, das ich, als ümb kürtz vnnd  
verdrus der lessenden, zwschreibenn vnnterlas.”/ “Nonetheless there was much riding war waged by both sides, cities taken, hamlets and villages razed, plundered, burned, the cattle taken, mounted troops and foot soldiers, as is the custom of war, laid low, captured, released for one another, of which I, for the sake of brevity and my readers’ frustration, will refrain from writing about.” (von Eyb, p. 132,  
translation mine)   


There is one very striking exception that I find very  
interesting. The chronicle of one Martin von Bolkenhain, writing about the Hussite Wars and their aftermath. He describes how his city of Bolkenhain is sacked  
during a feud between two local nobles and how the enemy invades the city. He then describes his personal experience of being on the receiving end of a  
plundering, which is an incredibly uncommon perspective. He describes how the plunderers go out of their way to seek through rich looking houses and  
churches, how they enter his house, break open his shop and loot everything they can get their hands on, holding him at sword point. They only stop at his  
wife, who according to him had given birth a few weeks ago and was still lying in bed. According to him, some of the looters knew his wife and spared the two,  
even allowing them to take their most valuable possessions with them. They then advised  
them to head to the cellar, as they intended to burn down the city, once they are done with looting and move on. So, whether you survived or not often times  
depended on whether or not you got lucky."

AskHistorians,"Why was Imperial China so deadly?It seems like every accounting of a battle goes like, ""After a small skirmish in which only 325,000 people were killed, the Emperor, in his wisdom and mercy, ordered only 73,000 of the townspeople to buried alive""","It is a very common phenomenon to “tweak” the  numbers during the war. Some exaggerate the number of one's own troops so as to deter the enemy, and they are mostly used when going out for battle. One of the most famous examples from the Three Kingdoms era, right before the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao sent a letter to Sun Quan, saying: 
>「今治水軍八十萬衆，方與將軍會獵於吳。」權得書以示羣臣，莫不嚮震失色。""Now there are 800,000  troops, and I look forward to a good hunt with your generals in the State of Wu.” (My rough translation)

Zhou Yu, one of the Sun Quan’s top generals overseeing the defense at Red Cliffs, reminded his lord after read Cao Cao’s threatening letter that: 
>「諸人徒見操書，言水步八十萬，而各恐懾 ...甚無謂也！今以實校之，彼所將中國人，不過十五六萬，且軍已久疲，所得表衆，亦極七八萬耳。」My rough translation: ""Everyone just sees that Cao claims to have 800,000 marine at his disposal, therefore may feel intimidated by such claim. …This is utter nonsense! Now let's verify his claim with facts. The number of troops under his command throughout the Central Plains would not exceed 150,000 to 160,000 men in total. After a long campaign his troops have been worn out, and the actual number of troops he could deploy (for the Battle of Red Cliffs) would be at most 70,000 to 80,000 men.”   

Zhou Yu's estimate may not be accurate, but it is certain that Cao Cao's ""800,000 marine"" was greatly inflated. In fact *Records of the Three Kingdoms* explicitly noted widespread practice of strategic inflation of military numbers at the time: 「破賊文書，舊**以一為十**」”For writings celebrating military victories, the **norm is to inflate the number ten-fold**” [1] So per  *Records of the Three Kingdoms*’s stated 1-to-10 ratio, Zhou Yu’s estimation of  Cao Cao’s force being no more than 80,000 men in contrast to the stated “800,000” may not be too far off.

 Another example can be found in the *History of Jin* (for the Jurchen Jin dynasty 1115–1234AD) which often directly state both actual and “propaganda number” for military engagements. In *History of Jin - Biography of Wanyan Ang*’s discussion of Song general Yue Fei’s troops during a northern campaign
>""Song general Yue Fei arrived with a force of 100,000 soldiers, which was publicized as one million men, to attack Dongping.""[2] 

 Again reflecting the traditional 1-to-10 strategic number inflation practice. A similar situation also can be found in *History of Jin - Biography of Yilawowo*, on Jin army’s move against Khitan rebel general Yilawowo, that
>""At Helanlu there are three thousand Capital Guards, publicized as twenty thousand. At Huining there are six thousand Jizhou Army, also publicized as twenty thousand.”[3]

>No youngster is going to believe in a beautiful knight on a white charger whose strength is as the strength of 10 because his heart is pure.

Tolkien was in reality a literary conservative reaching for the deep past (he disapproved even of Shakespeare), and it isn't hard to find that in his books. While groups like The Beatles and Led Zepplin were enthusiasts, this enthusiasm was not reciprocated by Tolkein ([see my previous answer here for a little on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m3tg3n/what_did_tolkien_think_of_the_fact_that_led/gqteude/)).

The books had relatively steady sales although not pop-culture level. Where the books suddenly became huge in the US was a (kind of) pirated Ace paperback version.

Ace was one of the biggest publishers of science fiction at the time. Ace had originally started as a line of comics (generally mystery, but some romance and western tossed in), published by Aaron A. Wyn (a Russian immigrant) before they expanded to book publishing in the 1950s and eventually phased out their comic line.

The book expansion was mainly due to the editor, Donald A. Wollheim, who was already responsible for one of the earliest sci-fi book collections, and had been trying to wheedle Wyn into book publishing; he had in fact been in negotiations with Pyramid for a new job, but a call for references got redirected incorrectly and Wyn found out about Donald's intentions to jump ship. He immediately went and offered the publishing job, so Ace Books was born.

Ace Books still kept with mystery / western standards although started to insert sci-fi early (again, this was Wollheim's passion) and that slowly ended up dominating their lineup, publishing leading authors like Ursula Le Guin and Roger Zelazny.

By 1964, sales of Lord of the Rings were respectable but not pop-culture-phenomenon level; in particular, there was no paperback version (Tolkien did not feel like his book was ""mass market""). Wollheim, while not a fantasy specialist, recognized that the books were something special, and called Tolkien in that year asking about publishing the books as paperbacks. He was rebuffed (something about paperbacks being ""degenerate"") which offended Wollheim, being enmeshed in the paperback business and knowing how much popularity the format could bring. He eventually realized a ""loophole"" in the copyright law -- specifically, as this was before the Berne Convention of the late 70s, this was back when you had to declare copyright in a particular country and also intentionally renew it (issues like this were why the original _Night of the Living Dead_ ended up being out of copyright). The books being sold in the US were simply ""published in the UK"" and they were popular enough that Houghton Mifflin had violated import limits and had (apparently) handled US copyright renewal incorrectly.

The snub plus the copyright situation led Donald to go ahead with what are now infamous ""unauthorized"" versions of Lord of the Rings. The books went from respectably-good-sellers to a phenomenon. (Tolkien and his publisher was already in the process of making a revised version that could have the copyright arranged correctly -- they found out Ace was putting out their version while in the process.)

The Ace version came out first and sold 100,000; Tolkien started to let fans to know about the unauthorized status of those versions.

>I am now inserting in every note of acknowledgement to readers in the U.S.A. a brief note informing them that Ace Books is a pirate, and asking them to inform others.

Ballantine published the ""real"" version and there ended up being great pressure on Ace, with some places refusing to sell their version (even though it went for cheaper, 75 cents per book versus 99). There was enough pressure that in February 1966 Wollheim made a royalty agreement and also agreed to not making any further printings (not under legal obligation! ... the loophole was real). 

The legal fuss ended up creating extra publicity leading to increased sales of both, and college student word-of-mouth enthusiasm was enough to push 1966 sales into the stratosphere. Wollheim suffered professionally, even though he was technically legally in the right; he was nominated for but never won the Editor Hugo, allegedly because of bad blood remaining over the incident. It is hard to say if the piracy was necessary for the second life of the book; really the big burst of publicity came from the giant fan campaign afterwards, but it comes too much into what-if territory to ask if the already strong word-of-mouth would have been good enough.

AskHistorians,"I’ve read that “Batman: The Animated Series” (1992-1995) was innovative, not just for the superhero genre, but TV animation in general. What was so revolutionary about it?","You asked about innovation/new techniques, and fittingly for an animated show, they took great pains with the visual design.

The most striking of these reinforced the bold ""Dark Deco"" art style that made *Batman: The Animated Series* instantly recognizable at a glance: it was drawn on black paper instead of white, which had never been done before in a television production. As Eric Radomski, show co-creator and background painter, pointed out, ""For animation, I don’t recall anyone ever doing that, other than maybe Mary Blair experimenting with some Disney short films. What we were doing was literally trying to interpret the night with an impressionist style. If we did it wrong, it was going to look like the black-velvet paintings that were popular in the ’60s and ’70s.""

Bruce Timm, show co-creator and director, made another stylistic choice that helped *TAS* stand out: ""There’s no good reason to draw every shoelace on a shoe. Just make it a simple shape. That was Eric’s and my basic idea for the entire series, to simplify everything. The characters and the vehicles and the props and the cars and everything — just boil everything down to its essential ingredient."" This was a reaction to other action-adventure cartoons Timm had worked on: ""\[E\]very single one of them, I thought, was overdesigned. They were trying to impress people with the amount of detail. On *G.I. Joe*, especially, it wasn’t enough just to draw a belt on a character, the belt had seams and buttons and snaps and pockets. ... We both were big fans of the Fleischer Studios cartoons from the 1940s. It was a combination of that and film-noir movies and things like *Citizen Kane*.""

Aurally, the show stood out via another unique tactic: they hired Shirley Walker, a composer who had worked with Danny Elfman on the first *Batman* film, who in turn brought on dozens of other composers, and in what Timm called ""a huge plus"" that was ""almost unheard of"" at the time, they scored every episode of the show.

They also cast a wider net when looking for voice actors, hiring a Juilliard-trained stage actor to play the title role rather than a known voice actor; it was Kevin Conroy's first-ever voiceover role.

AskHistorians,I’m a medieval scribe and the dang monastery cat left his inky paw print on my vellum. What do I do with the sheet? Do I simply write around it? Is there a way to salvage this sheet? Is this a common occurrence?,"I have good news for you eponymous medieval scribe, there are indeed a relatively easy procedures to correct mistakes on vellum/parchment!  Your feline friend's incursion need not ruin the manuscript that you've been working on and working over for these past many months.

The process for ""erasing"" on vellum is actually straightforward and can be accomplished in one of several ways.  The most straightforward was the use of a pumice stone to physically remove the error.  Vellum/parchment is not as thin as modern paper, it is treated animal skin afterall and is of considerably greater thickness than paper or papyrus.  Physically eroding the previous writing is therefore possible without the destruction of the page.  Pumice stones were used to physically remove the mistakes from the page.  The bare area of the parchment could then be redone without disrupting the piece of the manuscript as a whole.  This works best for small mistakes, such an errant line here, a spilled blot of ink there, or a miniature that isn't quite coming together in the marginalia.  In the case of a cat's paw staining the bottom of the page, this would likely be all you'd need to do in order to correct the unintended intrusion.  

What if you made a mistake on one of the writing lines?  The vellum was usually prepared with very faint lines in the center of the page to help with the placement of letters, and if you, in a hurry to complete your work, made a small mistake of grammar or punctuation, what could be done to remedy it?  A small scraping of the vellum with a fine knife would probably get the job done.  Assuming you even really wanted to make the correction, or even recognized it as a mistake.  The Middle Ages were a time of a lack of standard spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  [Indeed what we now recognize as hallmarks of legible texts, different case letters, punctuation, space between words, and the like were largely medieval innovations to aid in the legibility and ease of transmission of knowledge.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Codex_Amiatinus_-_Gospel_of_Mark%2C_chapter_1.jpg)  

These sorts of niceties were not a mainstay of literacy stretching back into the antique past.  [During the heyday of the Classical World inscriptions and writings usually lacked these modern luxuries and sentences were instead marked with verbs or other forms of delineation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek#/media/File:P46.jpg)  However, the state of Latin literacy in the European Middle Ages, while common, was not up to the standards of the titans of Classical Rome and Cicero and Caesar alike would have likely balked at the much more free approach to the ""rules"" of Latin grammar that Medieval writers adhered to.  This is why for you students of Latin out there that certain words have different meanings/rules depending on if the writing is Medieval, Ecclesiastical, or Classical.  So your mistake, depending on what the mistake was, may not even really matter!

But what if the sheet *is* ruined?  What do you do if the entire page needs to be reworked?  

Don't worry that is fixable as well!  Parchment and vellum are rather sturdy writing mediums and can take all sorts of abuse that paper or papyrus cannot withstand.  One option that you have if you need to re-do the entire page would be to wash it!  Throw the page in a bucket of water with some soap, or use some form of irritant and simply wash out the ink.  This is how a number of medieval manuscripts began their life.  Older writings from the ancient world were washed in this way to clean them of their current writings and to make functionally new pieces of parchment that could be overwritten.  These are called *palimpsests*, where the old writing was overdone by new writing after the manuscript page was cleaned in this way.  There are a number of ancient writings that only survived this way due to their recycling into medieval manuscripts.  The cleaning process was not absolute and many of these ancient works can still be read using modern technologies to read the writing that the Medieval people tried to erase.  

So don't fear!  You can still correct your mistake and finish your piece of work, and the client need not be any the wiser!"
AskHistorians,The car lobby is often cited as the reason public transportation was stifled in the US. But the US also had a massive powerful railroad industry in the 19th century. Did they try to counter-lobby in any way? Why did they fail?,"Alongside the general reasons mentioned by u/fiftythreestudio for the failure of rail-based public transit, the railway companies simply weren't interested in lobbying against the automobile until it was too late.

The first reason was that the rail companies were all doing badly around the time the automobile rose in prominence. The 1900s and 1910s brought anti-trust action that broke up many of the monopolies, and economic downturns such as the Panic of 1907 and the Great Depression also affected the rail companies significantly. The railways that didn't enter receivership were struggling to keep afloat (they also abandoned many rail lines, including less profitable passenger services) , and the more successful companies were trying to acquire and consolidate railroads. Lobbying against the automobile was very much a secondary priority.

Another was reason is that the railway/public transit lobbies didn't always see the automobile and federal support for roads as directly opposed to or competing with public transit. In the case of the interstate system, the public transit lobby actually supported the Interstate system. In the years prior to the Federal Highway Act of 1956 that would form the Interstate system, the American Transit Association, which represented many public transit operations both public and private, advocated the position that the highways weren't direct competitors with public transport systems. Instead of directly opposing the interstates, they instead lobbied for the freeways to accommodate public transportation infrastructure, such as light rail on the highway medians and dedicated bus lanes. To some extent, they achieved their goals with funding for certain mass transit projects like the Congress Line in between the Eisenhower Expressway, the Lake-Dan Ryan Line between the Dan Ryan Expressway, and a dedicated bus lane along the San Bernardino Freeway in LA. The ATA also pushed for a public transit exemption to the gas tax, which they also got in the FHA.

AskHistorians,"I’ve seen several conservative commentators claim that black slave owners existed, they made a significant portion of the slave owning class, & that the first person to own slaves in the colonies was black. Are any of these claims true?","There have been at least three major studies on the topic:

First was [*Free Negro Owners of Slaves in 1830*](https://archive.org/details/freenegroheadsof00wood/mode/1up) by Carter Woodson, published in 1924.

Next came [""Free Black Owners of Slaves: A Reappraisal of the Woodson Thesis""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27567319) by R. Halliburton, Jr., published in *The South Carolina Historical Magazine* in 1975. 

Most recently came [""Were African American Slaveholders Benevolent or Exploitative? A Quantitative Approach""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27648819) by David L. Lightner and Alexander M. Ragan, published in *The Journal of Southern History* in 2005. 

The latter two studies mostly support the conclusions reached by Woodson, though Lightner and Ragan, in particular, argue that Woodson may have been a bit conservative with his numbers.

Regardless, the ownership of humans by free black Americans was not all that widespread. According to the Halliburton study:

* There were about 3,775 black slaveholders in the U.S. at their peak in 1830, owning about 12,000 enslaved black people. This represents about 1/2 of 1% of all enslaved people in the U.S. being owned by a black slaveholder. This also represents about 1% of the free black population at that time being slaveholders. (Lightner & Ragan put this percentage closer to 2% of the free black population.) Black slaveholders represented about 0.003% (or 3/1000's of 1%) of the total U.S. population in 1830.

* Of them, about 42% owned one enslaved person, typically ""owning"" either a spouse or a child. That is, a black person bought their freedom from a slaveholder, then bought the freedom of a family member. They generally did not pay to emancipate the person they ""bought"" because it was expensive and the slave states made it difficult. (In many states, you had to petition the state legislature, or file suit at a local/county courthouse, who typically said no. For example, Lightner & Ragan say that, in the decade before 1830, the state legislature of Alabama were granting between 10-20 manumission petitions per year.)

* Of the 3,775 total black slaveholders, about half of them lived in cities. They were not engaged in agricultural or plantation work. 

* Also of them, about 67% of them lived in one of four states in 1830: Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, and Louisiana. No other state had more than 110 total black slaveholders at that time. 

* Lightner and Ragan further clarify that, while there *were* certainly black slaveowners who were exploitative, the percentage of such slaveowners was between 19%-27% of all black slaveowners, which translates to about 1,000 total such slaveowners. But of them, these 1,000 individuals held about 2/3rds of all enslaved people held by black slaveowners in 1830. 

Expressed in percentages, about 1/2 of 1% of all exploitative slaveowners were black. Put another way, at the peak, there were around 1,000 black slaveowners who were exploitative owning about 8,000 enslaved people. At the same time, (according to Lightner & Ragan), there were about 224,000 white slaveowners who were also exploitative and owned the remainder of the 2 million enslaved people in the US in 1830.

Also keep in mind that this was the peak. After 1830, the slave states cracked down on this practice. In the aftermath of the Nat Turner Rebellion, most slave states made it illegal for freed black people to remain in the state. A newly-freed black person usually had 30-60 days to leave the state for the North, or else they would be arrested. If they still refused to leave, they would be re-enslaved. (Free black people already residing in the state before that date were generally ""grandfathered in"", but as the decades went by, there were fewer of them since there were no new free black people replacing them as the older ones died off or voluntarily moved away.)

So after 1830, the percentage of black slaveowners began to decrease significantly, and fewer than 1,000 black exploitative slaveowners existed by the time of the Civil War. By then, the number of white slaveowners had almost doubled, approaching 500,000 in 1860. Only about 1/10 of 1% of all slaveowners were black when the Civil War broke out.

As for first slaveowner in the pre-U.S. British colonies, that claim may go to [Captain William Peirce](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517151449/https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/peirce-william-d-btw-1645-and-1647/), a white Englishman who was a member of the Governor's Council and later the House of Burgesses. He is recorded to have purchased an enslaved woman from Angola [named Angela](https://web.archive.org/web/20210528202138/https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/angela-fl-1619-1625/) before 1625, and likely when she arrived in 1619. (See also: [*She Took Justice: The Black Woman, Law, and Power – 1619 to 1969*](https://books.google.com/books?id=0zsKEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT33) by Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, Routledge, 2021, pp.33-34, for a bit more information.)

The white supremacist/apologist claim is, I believe, a reference to [Anthony Johnson](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/court-ruling-on-anthony-johnson-and-his-servant-1655/), who is thought to have arrived in Virginia with the same group of Angolans that Angela was a part of. By 1655, Johnson had purchased his freedom, and was in court over a case involving another African person who he owned as a captive in slavery. He may have been the first black slaveowner in the pre-US known by name, but slavery where white people were slaveholders of black people had been around for over a generation by then. 

**EDIT:**

Expanding this to include the Spanish colonies that later became part of the U.S., the first enslaved African person to set foot in Florida was named Estevanico, or Esteban, who had been sold into slavery in present-day Morocco in 1522. He was purchased by a Spanish noble named Andrés Dorantes de Carranza. The two took part in the Narváez Expedition, which arrived in Florida in April 1528. (See: *Esteban: The African Slave Who Explored America* by Dennis Herrick, University of New Mexico Press, 2018. pp. xiii-xiv, 19, 53.) 

As others have mentioned, the Spanish were slave-trading in colonies in now-South Carolina and Florida in the 1520s and 30s, though in colonies that did not last. Slavery was essentially permanently introduced and established in Spanish North America by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in 1565, when his expedition to Florida brought 500 captive Africans with them for the purposes of exploiting them as slave labor. Menéndez's expedition would found the first permanent Spanish colony at St. Augustine, Florida.

Thus, it was certainly before the British brought Africans to North America that the Spanish were doing the same thing there first - so much so that Hispaniola (1522), Puerto Rico (1527), Santo Domingo (1533), modern day Mexico (1537), and modern day Panama (1552) all experienced slave rebellions against the Spanish before the English had ever established their first successful North American colony. (See: *The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade: 1440-1870* by Hugh Thomas, Simon & Schuster, pp.103-105.)

But this goes beyond the scope of what I believe was the intent of OP's question, which focused on the origins of slavery in the pre-United States. It's still a question worth answering - the relationship of Spain, colonization, and the origins of African slavery in those colonies - but it's one that goes beyond my expertise. Maybe someone else can fill in the blanks. And maybe fill in the blanks on Portugal's early role, too.

**EDIT**: Thanks for the gold and the other awards!"
AskHistorians,"My dad is convinced that Portuguese sailors ""discovered"" Australia before the Dutch in the 17th century. Is this just misplaced nationalist pride, or is there some truth to this claim?","It is unlikely but plausible that a Portuguese ship may have landed on Australia before the Dutch. However, there doesn't exist any concrete evidence to support that hypothesis. The theory originated with British geographers, and was not the work of Portuguese people faking maps to try and claim colonization rights.

Rather, it was initially based on the Dieppe maps, which were produced in France during the 16th century (with the oldest dating back to 1540). These maps were not produced to be used as actual maps, but rather, as works of art. They purported to show the entirety of the globe, though the entirety of it was not yet known, and so had to 'fill in the blanks', so to speak. Many of these depict a landmass roughly where Australia is today, and label it Jave la Grande. However, this landmass is usually connected to what we would call Antarctica, and not depicted as its own continent.

The name is derived from The Travels of Marco Polo, which was published in 1300. According to Marco Polo, the largest island in the world was located 1300 miles to the south of Champa. He was describing the island of Sumatra. However, a scribe at some point made an error, and it was published as 1300 miles to the south of Java - roughly where the northern coast of Australia is. And so, because of a scribal error, you had a book suggesting the existence of a large landmass roughly where Australia is, even though there was not yet any evidence of such a landmass, way back in 1300.

The continent of Antarctica had also not been discovered yet at this point. Nonetheless, the existence of a continent far to the south had been hypothesized since antiquity. Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Ptolemy argued that there was probably a large southern landmass on the basis that it would 'balance out' all the northern landmasses. There was no other evidence to support the existence of this hypothetical continent, which was known as Terra Australis.

During the age of exploration, basically every time a new landmass was discovered further South than anything else previously known, it was initially assumed to be the northern coast of this hypothetical continent, only for subsequent explorations to reveal they had just found another island. This happened a lot as various explorers attempted to find a Southern passage past South America. Most notably, after Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Strait of Magellan in 1520, the island of Tierra del Fuego was initially thought to be the Northern tip of the legendary Terra Australis (some suggested it was probably just an island as early as 1525, but it wasn't until 1616 that it was proven to be an island).

And so in 1544, Jean Alfonse suggested that Terra Australis did exist, arguing that Tierra del Fuego represented one end of it, and that the 'largest island of world' suggested to exist by Marco Polo likely represented the other end of it, and was thus not actually an island, but part of a yet-to-be discovered southern continent. Alfonse labeled this land as 'La Grand Jave' in reference to Marco Polo's description of it being the largest island in the world - and placed it roughly where Australia actually is, on the basis of the error made when scribes were making copies of Marco Polo's book, and the assumption it extended through the South Pole. This idea was then incorporated into the Dieppe maps, whose makers did not know what was there, and 'filled in the blanks' by assuming that Terra Australis existed and extended about as far north as the northern coast of Australia actually does (and a bit further on its western side, extending all but to the island of Java).

This is all to say that, at the time the Dieppe maps were made, they were almost certainly not considered to depict a discovered continent, but rather, to depict a hypothetical continent, Terra Australis, which was thought to encompass both Antarctica and Australia.

As your Dad mentioned, the Portuguese were the first to land on various Southeast Asian islands. They developed a stronghold in Malaysia in 1511, from which they explored the surrounding islands, but did not reach Timor until 1556. Thus, they were, all things considered, relatively close to Australia for some 50 years or more before the Dutch and Spanish expeditions of 1606. However, I agree with you that it would be a fallacy to assume that they would have discovered Australia within that time. 400km is not a small distance. Moreover, as far as we know, nobody ever claimed to have discovered a landmass further south. However, there were probably rumors of a land mass to the South of Timor, arising from the historical ideas of Terra Australis, and possibly from stories told by the natives.

Alternatively, this consideration might instead be taken as evidence that actual knowledge of Australia did not predate the depictions of it in the Dieppe maps, in that, the landmass was depicted there well before even Timor was reached.

The idea that the Portuguese had a secret colony there because they did not want to be caught violating the Treaty of Tordesillas has no evidence. It has been postulated only as an explanation for why the theory that Portuguese landed on Australia before the Dutch also has no (definitive) evidence. This is just a conspiracy theory as far as I'm concerned. At any rate, the Treaty of Saragossa was signed in 1529 and gave Portugal rights to all but the east coast of Australia. And so, if Portugal did establish a secret colony sometime between 1494 and 1528 - they could have announced their discovery at any point between 1529 and 1606 without violating the treaty.

Much later, in 1762, Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple first learned about the 1606 expeditions (in particular, Luis Váez de Torres' discovery of the Strait of Torres), and connected that with the idea of Terra Australis. He basically made the exact same assumption as Jean Alfonse made in 1544, which was incorporated into the Dieppe maps - maybe the land the Dutch discovered in 1606 corresponded to the northern edge of Terra Australis.

Dalrymple's ideas prompted a number of expeditions to determine whether the land mass genuinely corresponded to the legendary continent of Terra Australis, including James Cooks'  expeditions. Cook's first expedition in 1770 mapped the East coast of Australia, and demonstrated that Australia was not part of Terra Australis. His second expedition in 1772 proved that New Zealand was not a part of Terra Australis either, and further, he circumnavigated the globe at a high southern latitude, demonstrating that any possible Southern continent was restricted to Polar regions.

As somewhat of an aside, it was because of this that the idea of a southern continent faded from favor. And in 1814, Matthew Flinders published the book A Voyage to Terra Australis, in which he argues that the legendary Terra Australis hypothesized to exist by Aristotle and Ptolemy in antiquity did not actually exist. He named the landmass that did exist - the next best thing - in its honor, as Australia. It wouldn't be until 1820 that Terra Australis would be discovered (what we now call Antarctica).

Meanwhile, in 1786, Dalrymple re-discovered the Dieppe maps, which seemed to be made prior to the discovery of Australia, and yet depicted it, if only as a protrusion of Antarctica. So he briefly mentioned the possibility of this being evidence of an earlier Portuguese discovery (the Dieppe maps were made in France but often relied on Portuguese source material and used Portuguese names for locations - such as La Grand Jave - which is why it was assumed to represent a Portuguese, and not a French, discovery). However, Dalrymple did not particular champion this belief, and it did not gain much traction until much later.

Later supporters of this idea generally suggest that the Dieppe maps were made with some greater knowledge of what the coast line of Australia looked like than could have been the case if they were just depicting a hypothetical continent (or else, they were ignorant altogether of the idea that it might just be depicting a hypothetical landmass). This approach often involves distorting the depicted lines to various kinds of map projections and trying to match them to the actual coastline of Australia, and is generally not very convincing. Most people believe the maps merely represent the landmass Jean Alfonse and others had hypothesized to exist there.

I'm not a linguist, but my understanding is that the evidence on that front is also not very convincing."
AskHistorians,Was Cleopatra black?,"Cleopatra was not, by any modern definition, a black woman. She was a scion of and the last ruler from the Lagid Dynasty, a Macedonian Greek house founded by Ptolemy I Soter, a companion of Alexander the Great. The Lagids pretty much exclusively married other Macedonians and Greek women, with them often marrying consanguineously.

Cleopatra has often been speculated to be black or perhaps mixed-race, for a number of reasons. I’ll be as charitable as I can be, and lay out the evidence that could point to her being not white. Firstly, Cleopatra’s grandmother is unattested in sources: her father, Ptolemy XII, was widely considered to have been a bastard by ancient historians such as Cicero, Pausanias, and Pompeius Trogus. It has been suggested, therefore, that Ptolemy XII was the issue of the white Lagid king Ptolemy IX and a black African concubine.

Secondly, Cleopatra was, particularly compared with her predecessors, an enthusiastic supporter of Egyptian culture, learning to speak Egyptian and presenting herself in traditional Pharaonic dress and customs. It has been suggested by Afrocentric writers that this is indicative of her heritage as a black African woman, and her turning toward her heritage and away from the Hellenised culture of preceding Lagid rulers.

However, these arguments are, upon closer examination, spurious. Firstly, the claim that Ptolemy XII’s mother was a black concubine is highly doubtful, with historians considering it far more likely that she would be a white Alexandrian Greek woman. It is possible she was a member of the Egyptian elite, however this would almost certainly make her specifically from the established nobility from Lower Egypt (in the North of the country). Egypt had (and still has) a significant population of people whom would today be considered black, and indeed had black Pharaohs, however the people of Lower Egypt are genetically very similar to the people typically associated with Egyptian appearance today; that being light-brown skinned people similar to Middle Easterners.

Secondly, regarding Cleopatra’s embrace of Egyptian culture, it frankly diminishes her considerable political nouse and intelligence to attribute her Egyptian language skills and visual adoption of their culture as a mere extension of their heredity. Cleopatra was incredibly savvy and intelligent, and knew her Kingdom was increasingly at risk of subjugation by a greater power in the region (realistically Rome or maybe Parthia), and she also knew the detached and unpopular Lagids were very weak and at risk of deposition. Embracing Egyptian culture was a conscious effort to indigenise her dynasty and build popular support for the Lagids among the Egyptian people, legitimise her own rule against her brothers who sought her overthrow, and establish herself as an independent and sovereign Egyptian queen. Her actions are far from unique, indeed many other rulers would ape her example by adopting the language and culture of those that they conquered as a means of establishing their own authority in their realms. It is wrong therefore to suggest it was some desire to relate closely to a distant relative who was likely dead by the time of her birth and not an openly political move to strengthen her authority. It is also further complicated by the fact her father, who would be half-black were this to be true, was just as ignorant and unwilling to participate in Egyptian culture as all of his decidedly Macedonian predecessors.

As this is a history focused subreddit, I will refrain from sharing my thoughts on why so many people attempt to paint Cleopatra as black, and why as a black person myself I find it particularly offensive. The long and short of it though is that, based on the totality of evidence, Cleopatra was almost certainly ethnically white, overwhelmingly of Macedonian Greek extraction with a smattering of Iranian heritage via Ptolemaic intermarriage with the Seleucids and Mithradatids of Pontus. That does not preclude her from being an Egyptian (and indeed, especially in the ancient era, race was never conceptualised the way it is today with such a focus on skin tone), but it does preclude her from having the appearance of what we would today say is a black woman.

EDIT: Well, this got a much bigger response than I expected. I keep getting notifications on my phone from people commenting, and I'm glad so many of you found my answer informative! I wanted to put this here for now to say thanks, and I will respond to your comments and post some sources/further reading a little later when I have a free hour during work. Thanks!

EDIT 2/SOURCES:

u/Pami_the_Younger makes a valid point below that I was wrong to assert Cleopatra was 100% Macedonian Greek, as she did have some (very distant) Iranian ancestry from Sogdia and the Pontic Mithradatic dynasty. I have changed that statement above to reflect that.

For reference to the bastardy of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's father, see Cicero's *de Lege Agrarıa contra Rullum*, 2.42, which states that Ptolemy XII was known to all men to be not of royal lineage, and Pausanias' *Hellados Periegesis, Attica,* 1.9.3., which details how the Athenians honoured Ptolemy IX (Ptolemy XII’s father) with a bronze statue to him and his only legitimate child, Berenice.

For reference to the racial background of Cleopatra's grandmother as a Greek, there are several secondary sources that assert this, however the ones I'm most familiar with are from Stacy Schiff's *Cleopatra: A Life*, p.24. *The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt,* by Aidan Dodson, on p.277. also suggests Ptolemy XII's mother was of either Greek or Lower-Egyptian heritage.

I did also take the time to do some research on secondary sources that assert Cleopatra having black ancestry, and the first claims on paper I can find are from the work ""The World's Great Men of Colour"" by J.A. Rogers, pp. 129-130. After a brief biography of Cleopatra, he claims that before the rise of the ""doctrine of white superiority"", Cleopatra was portrayed as ""coloured"". He cites Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, where she is described as ""tawny"", and references how said phraseology was used to refer to Moors and ""mulattoes"" by contemporary individuals, such as Captain John Smith of Virginia. That being said, Rogers acknowledges that Smith used tawny to refer explicitly to *brown-skinned* individuals, and not *black* individuals, supplying a quote of him describing a ruler of Morocco as ""not black, as many suppose, but tawny"".

I don't consider Rogers' reference to Shakespeare to be of much historical value as a source, given that Shakespeare was no historian himself, but I do find it prescient that even here Rogers argues she is brown-skinned and a person of colour, rather than a black woman.

Unfortunately, I have been unusually busy at work this afternoon, so I won't have time to get to your comments until this evening, but I wanted to get these sources out as soon as.

EDIT THREE: I have reflected a little since getting home about this answer, and while in terms of my core facts and conclusions I'm still happy with it, I do want to change some of the wording I used. As u/cleopatra_philopater and others have pointed out, race is a nebulous concept, and in the ancient world nothing like how we conceptualize it today. The concept of Cleopatra, or any figure in the ancient Mediterranean, identifying with a racial group is ahistorical; racial identity as we see it is far more modern. Consequently, my descriptor of Cleopatra as a ""white Egyptian"" is easily open to misconstrual.

When I wrote the piece, I was trying to say that Cleopatra would, were she transported to the present-day, not be seen as a black woman, but rather a white woman. However, with the way I wrote the piece, I did not emphasise enough that said racial identifier comes from a modern lens, not from one with which she would have been remotely familiar. She would not have *identified* as white, because identification with a racial phenotype was simply not something that was done in that era. The fact of the matter is, regardless of what skintone she had, she would have been awfully confused at how figures seek to identify her strongly with a racial identity she did not have.

I believe Cleopatra was, based on the totality of evidence, a woman who today would be considered white, not black. She was not however a ""white woman"" in the sense that we understand it today, and mapping racial identities onto cultures with no real concept of them as we understand them is not something that can be done well."

AskHistorians,Being the first to the enemy’s walls during a siege sounds like certain death. What motivated people during the Middle Ages and Antiquity to be the first to climb the ladder or siege tower?,"I can speak to the practice during Roman times. The mural crown or *corona muralis* was a gold crown fashioned to look like crenelations used as a military award (think up there with the US Medal of Honor, or Britain’s Victoria Cross) by the Romans. This was awarded to the first legionary to scale the walls, overcome defenders in his path, and successfully mount the battlements.

Usually, this would be the centurion of a unit, who would solicit the help of the legionaries under his command to support his ascent, by helping set the ladder, flinging missiles at the defenders on the battlements, and following him up to help push the defenders from the walls to secure the award, etc. The centurion would undoubtedly distribute some of financial rewards to those that assisted them, and the prestige of being part of the “team” that won the mural crown was likely very significant even if you weren’t the direct recipient.

As far as motivation, besides a monetary award that likely accompanied the decoration, an award such as the *corona muralis* would confer a level of status and prestige hard to relate to today. In a society so enthralled with military virtue and accomplishment, being awarded the mural crown of would make you a high-profile celebrity, likely conferred a sizable financial award as previously mentioned, and had the very real possibility of launching a aspiring politician’s career to the highest levels of office. It is important to remember that Rome’s commanders and Rome’s politicians were the same elite group of senators or equites (“knights”), underlining the intrinsic relation between military and political success in Roman society. They also had a strong Homeric ethic, meaning individual accomplishments of valour and prowess on the battlefield were celebrated alongside strategic or tactical victories on the part of a victorious general.

The Romans also practiced a fanatical form of ancestor worship, with wax “death masks” of their ancestors prominently displayed in a public area of the house alongside their respective accomplishments. Being elected to the highest office would permanently give a family the elevated social status of the *nobiles* (nobles) which would serve as a significant source of pride and status for future generations. Along the same lines, having an ancestor (even distant) who won the *corona muralis* would be something the recipient’s great, great, great grandson could lord over his peers in a socially significant way. EDIT: The Romans also believed that virtue and capacity for accomplishment was passed from father to son through the generations, albeit without understanding modern genetics.

Tiberius Gracchus, the elder of the famous *populare* Gracchi brothers, was awarded the *corona muralis* for being the first one to scale the walls during the sack of Carthage during the Third Punic War. A similarly prestige award, the *corona civitas* or “Civic Crown”, was awarded to Julius Caesar for saving the life of a fellow citizen in battle and holding the ground afterwards, and was considered to be one of the greatest accomplishments of his career, which is saying something.

Additionally, the Romans almost never gave posthumous military decorations, and we hear about the mural crown being awarded often enough that it seems relatively common. In theory, any time the Romans took a city by storm, one would be awarded (after a lengthy and thorough litigation of who made it to the top first. Roman military awards were a serious business), and given Rome conquered the entire Mediterranean world, cities were taken by storm aplenty. Additionally, while still extremely dangerous, once a battle or siege started to go in one side’s direction, it tended to be fairly one-sided in terms of casualties, meaning that if you could successfully mount the battlements with enough of your comrades to secure the foothold, you had a reasonable expectation of survival.

To sum it up, with our modern frame of reference, it is hard to conceptualize just how much importance cultures in antiquity placed on military accomplishments, the Romans even more so than typically found. It would be as if a Medal of Honor recipient was automatically given *the* starring role in a blockbuster movie featuring their own exploits, won the lottery, and was an immediate frontrunner for the next Presidential election. So while the risks were immense, success would mean near-godlike status, not to mention the possibility of wealth and political advancement for your family for generations to come."
AskHistorians,"The American Midwest seems filled with beautiful structures, such as court houses and universities, made with marble and intricate craftmanship, in even small towns, all built 1910ish. If these were built today the material and labor would make costs so high. How did these small towns do it?","Books could be written on this, but there are two things going on here worth noting.

There is a general trend in architecture to more from the expensive and fussy to the simple and cheap. We could explain this as a streamlining of taste, and that clearly occurred, but expense is obviously a factor. One of the reasons why people want to save old buildings is because ""they don't build them like that anymore."" Creating all that detail and using all those expensive materials is simply prohibitive in almost all cases. During the span of the twentieth century architectural style moved from the elaborate, often monumental [beaux arts](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/beaux-arts-buildings-nyc) to streamlined metal and glass boxes. 

That's not to deride modern architectural design necessarily. While there is a lot of lazy cut and paste work, there are also serious architects who are thoughtful, gifted artists, but modern choices are affected by cost, and the trend allows for buildings with a lot less expense and detail.

The second factor is at the heart of the Midwest. People arrived there and settled, imagining that their families would be there for generations, and so they built things to last. 

While I appreciate the link and summons by our colleague /u/Cedric_Hampton, my work on Nevada courthouses - and my overall [architectural history of Nevada](https://www.amazon.com/Nevadas-Historic-Buildings-Cultural-Shepperson-ebook/dp/B01F12N0WG?ref_=ast_author_dp) (co-authored with the brilliant Elizabeth Ann Harvey) tells a different story about architecture in the Intermountain West, ... and this offers a digression worth considering. There, people did not expect to linger and they did not always build things to last. The Nevada capitol, built in 1869 only ten years after the great Comstock gold and silver strike that inspired the creation of the Nevada Territory (1861) and state (1864), had already experienced the rollercoaster of the mining industry: there had been as many as three depressions in those ten years, and no one was certain if they would remain there for long. The capitol building is large, but it would be humble for most Midwestern county courthouses of that time.

The Midwest built big and impressively. It built to be impressive and to last, because those people knew that they would last. Right there. And they wanted their children's children to benefit from their foresight that inspired them to spend the money to have grand architecture.

I now live in the Midwest, and I am continually impressed by the historic architecture that one sees here. My nearby, relatively small town of Ames, Iowa has at least as much monumental historic architecture than the entire state of Nevada. Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but at times, it certainly feels that way. The neighboring Marshalltown boasts a courthouse that far larger and grander than any in Nevada - and it is far more monumental than the Nevada capitol.

The thing about historic architecture is that it is not there to be judged or to cast judgment. It must be treated as a book that can be read. There are reasons for architecture design and style choices. 

The Intermountain West built fast and cheap because that was what was expected of the lifespan of their communities. The Midwest build grant and expensively because the expected lifespan of their communities was being measured in generations not in a handful of years. Add to this was the general trend internationally to build with expensive materials and detail during the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. This was just when the Midwest was building its communities, and it shaped the design legacy that we see to this day."
AskHistorians,"Did left-handed swordsmen have an advantage on the battlefield, like left-handed batters do in baseball?","*In theory,* left-handed warriors could have had an advantage in ancient warfare, but not for the reasons you suggest. Ancient battles were not won by superior swordsmanship, and a single man's prowess did not have any impact on the outcome of wars. These battles were an activity of large numbers of men, typically fighting in formation. With that in mind, the important difference between a left-handed warrior and the more common right-handed one would have been that they held their *shield* in the other hand. 

In marching columns and battle formations it was taken for granted that everyone was right-handed. Each man would provide an identical form of cover for himself and the men around him, and arrayed side by side, they would form an unbroken front. But the ancient Greeks already realised that this transferred the weakness of every man to the whole formation: as he marched, one of his sides was well protected, but the other side was not. With every man carrying his shield on his left arm, every infantry formation had what the Greeks called a ""naked side"". An army on the march could not protect itself effectively against attacks from the right, since its shields were all on the other side. In order to block even a simple volley of rocks or javelins from hidden assailants, they would need to stop, turn around to face their attackers, and keep still with that facing until the enemy were driven off, lest they expose their naked side again. In battle, too, the right side of the formation was especially vulnerable to flanking attacks, since individual warriors had no way to protect themselves on that side without disrupting their formation.

This vulnerability was also exploited in the design of fortresses and city walls. The most obvious points of attack in these fortifications were the gates, and so many city gates were not placed in line with the wall, but perpendicular to it - and facing left (when seen from within the city). This forced the enemy to turn left to approach them, exposing their right side to the defenders on the walls. A common elaboration of this defence was to extend the wall past the gate to create a corridor, which the enemy would have to funnel themselves into to reach the gate, keeping their unshielded right facing the city the whole time. Many fortified places would be designed to ensure that anyone who tried to approach the gate would spend as much time as possible with his shield uselessly facing outward, while his ""naked side"" was open to attack.

*In theory,* then, the left-handed warrior might have a real advantage, both on the march, in pitched battle, and during siege assaults. There would have been various occasions on which a hypothetical unit of men carrying shields on their right arm might have helped to protect the whole army.

But no such units were ever created. To my knowledge, it was never even considered. I'm not an expert outside of the Greek world, but speaking for my own specialism, there is simply no discussion of left-handedness as a factor in Greek warfare at all. Not a single text ever mentions it. The right-handedness of all warriors is absolutely taken for granted. I've [answered a question similar to yours on this subreddit years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40bm6m/did_anyone_ever_assemble_a_military_force/cysz6at/), and I've been able to link to it many times since, because it seems a lot more redditors have considered this possibility than people in the ancient world.

As I mention in that post, there is one instance in the Biblical Book of Judges in which the Benjamites raise a unit of 700 left-handed swordsmen. However, the only notable feature of these men according to the account of Judges is that they were very skilled slingers. They never recur in the ensuing narrative of successive battles against the Israelites. There is no indication of what these men did in these battles, or even why their unit was specially created. We can speculate, of course, that this is just such a left-handed flank guard, meant to protect the right wing of the army by holding their shields on their other arm. But that is no more than a theory, and the experiment is never repeated.

We can think of some obvious reasons why people wouldn't be interested in pursuing the idea. The main period in which an army of right-handed men would be vulnerable was during the march. But how could a single unit of southpaws correct this? Marching columns could only be as wide as the road they marched on; you couldn't simply add a whole extra unit along its width. In any case, you wouldn't have enough left-handed warriors to form a unit as long as the whole army column, so only a short section of it would be covered. The alternative would be to string the unit out along the entire column in single file - which might provide the protection of its shields, but would make it impossible for the men to function as a unit. It would take them perhaps literally hours to draw themselves together into a battle formation of an emergency called for it. In other words, either you spread the men out to the point where their presence becomes a logistical liability - how do you ensure that every stretch of your regular battle line has its assigned detachment of exactly as many left-handed men as it needs? - or you gather them together in a way that renders them unable to do most of their assigned tasks.

It *might* have been conceivable to create a unit of left-handed men for the purpose of holding the right flank in battle; perhaps if you bestowed the right kinds of rewards on them you might even be able to get them to lead the charge against every city gate that forced a left-turn approach. But nothing like that was ever attempted in reality. Almost certainly the process of selection for such a unit would make it too cumbersome. There is also the problem I noted in the linked post: to compensate for their vulnerability on the right, hoplite formations tended to edge to the right as they advanced. Imagine putting a unit on the end of the line that edged to the left instead - its vector crossing that of the rest of the army. Having such a unit would cause nothing but confusion as the battle line sought to maintain a front.

In any case, this is all idle speculation; the most important reason why these units never emerged was probably that there was considerable social stigma against left-handedness in many ancient societies. The prejudiced association of the left with bad, crooked, and evil things (for instance, the English word ""sinister"" comes from the Latin for left) may have nipped any suggestion of such a unit in the bud. Instead, the warriors of the ancient Mediterranean world apparently universally fought with their right hand, and carried their shields on their left."

And if you lie you're going to be guilty of perjury.  Now basically that was the whole story of the Hiss case.  It is not the issue that will harm you; it is the cover-up that is damaging.

>-- Nixon, [from one of his 1972 tapes](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hiss/hissnixontapes.html)

Nixon started out in 1947 as a Representative and later Senator of California, and was a far-right superstar, standing out with his dogged pursuit of Alger Hiss and Communism, culminating in Hiss getting five years of prison in 1950 for perjury. However, that same group turned against him once he became the VP candidate with Eisenhower, who was allegedly soft on communism (and whom the ultra-conservative John Birch Society called [a secret Communist](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lbtfkl/what_were_the_goals_of_the_john_birch_society_in/glye10k/) in their infamous ""Black Book"").

This disdain followed Nixon into his presidency; while some conservatives adjusted to support the candidate, the ones who felt he had betrayed them were still unhappy; quoting Bill Rusher, publisher of National Review:

>That tired, tergiversating tramp never impressed me for a moment as a conceivable instrument for any useful end.

Nixon opening relations with China truly went back to solidifying the far-right disdain for him, and they even supported a challenger primary candidate (Ashbrook) in 1972 for Nixon's re-election.

Watergate brought the far-right back to Nixon's side; essentially claiming that a ""liberal conspiracy"" was afoot and that Nixon was merely being persecuted. Simultaneous to this the some Republicans stuck to rugged support, with Nixon loyalists forming the National Citizens’ Committee for Fairness to the Presidency (re-made as the United States Citizens' Congress in 1974).

Barry Goldwater in particular rushed in as a strong representative. He was the Birch Society's candidate in 1964, the promise of the far-right realized, but his comments on nuclear weapon use and other radical opinions sunk his election, making a landslide win for Johnson. 

He was back in Congress by Nixon, re-elected as a Senator from Arizona; Goldwater realized the damage Watergate could do to the Republicans, and realized fairly quickly when talking to audiences in 1973 that there were rich donors refusing to give money while Watergate was still overhanging. He encouraged frank words from Nixon speaking out:

>The Senator, who has emerged as a hero during this sordid episode played an important and, perhaps, decisive role in persuading the President to—at long last—speak out on Watergate.

This led to some upset letters from Nixon loyalists, and it is these letters where we know some of the die-hard opinions; one latter calls Goldwater a ""turn coat and hypocrite"" that should stop ""kicking the president when he is down.""

Certainly, at this time, there was still a strong sense of a liberal conspiracy especially through the media, with Senator Helms calling it a means of undoing the presidential election: ""... by a process of selective indignation, became the lever by which embittered liberal pundits have sought to reverse the 1972 conservative judgment of the people.""

While 50% of Republicans still supported Nixon by the release of the ""smoking gun"" tape -- where it became abundantly clear Nixon knew and aided in the cover-up -- things drastically changed after that, with eventually all mainstream Republicans and newspapers turning their back.

The Tulsa Daily World had ""supported Mr. Nixon through many adversities"" but still called for his resignation; the Dallas Times-Herald (also a Nixon endorser) called for likewise. The LA Times, a very long-standing supporter (all the way to 1946) expressed an outright feeling of betrayal.

Still: we have letters to Goldwater, who despite calling for Nixon's frankness, had up to this moment still been a supporter. Even past the point where Goldwater gave up and joined the chorus calling for resignation there were hangers-on. What were they like?

He was told by one World War II veteran to

>... get on the backs of the ""Turn Coat"" Republicans and get in there and fight for the ""Greatest President ever!""

He was implored to

>... please stand by our president. He has been guilty of many mistakes in my judgment but I don’t think he is a criminal. Who among you in Congress could stand up to the persecution he has endured?

One letter from Illinois said

>I am really appalled at the way party members in Congress are backing down before what every man on the street knows is a Radical-Liberal plot.

The general theming was, essentially:

a.) Nixon was still a great president (détente with the Soviet Union, opening up China, ""peace with honor"" in Vietnam; keep in mind Saigon fell during Ford).

b.) There was still a liberal conspiracy.

c.) The station of the presidency was weakened: ""the dangerous precedent of allowing the presidency to be weakened by forces motivated essentially by politics"".

The year Nixon resigned ended in utter disaster for the GOP, with polling by Robert Teeter only showing 19% support.

AskHistorians,"Why do so many important cultural origins and people seem to originate from around Kazakhstan, and why is it so rarely taught?","I do not specialize in this area so I can't speak directly to the things mentioned, but I can tell you that in general Central Asia gets short shrift because it doesn't have much of a natural academic home.  

Its period of major prominence precedes modernity, making it a hard sell to under-funded history departments in the first place.  Most of the region is not strongly connected to modern major nation states - aside from as a sidenote to the history of the USSR - so it doesn't have significant domestic academic publishing, or a lot of funding to promote programs at foreign schools.  

At the same time, major states which border the region have historical reasons to downplay its influence in favour of their own.  Russia sees these countries as temporarily displaced regions of their own, while China would like the world to forget places like Tibet and Mongolia ever had any particular relevance outside their interactions with China.   

And then you have the issue that Islamic then Soviet influence meant there was often limited impetus to preserve documents and sites which preceded these regimes, and they were at times outright hostile toward the notion. 

The end result is that nobody but specialists writes about Mahayana Buddhism as an Afghan or Central Asian development, for instance.  Tantric deities all over Japan being depicted as kings or generals in armour from Central Asian kingdoms is almost never mentioned.  Most have always just assumed it all came out of India (a notion which East Asian Buddhist institutions themselves have long put forward for reasons of projecting prestige and authenticity).  

Everyone doing Asian history learns about the Silk Road, but it's typically framed in terms of being a trade route connecting the Mediterranean and Middle East with China, most of the areas in between are glossed over as not of primary interest.  Those kingdoms and alliances unintentionally become sketched almost as truck stops along the way.

This is not to say there hasn't been a good deal of rigorous work done on the region, but I don't know how many universities even have dedicated Central Asian programs or journals, rather than one or two scholars who are attached to religion, history or South/East Asian area studies departments."

were a manifestation of bourgeois culture as well

as capitalist excesses, and the Russian Society for

Perhaps the starkest evidence of the change is a dog-care manual by Aleksandr Shenets
(7th edition: 1917) which was transformed, for its next 1928 edition, into a much
different presentation, with [a postal dog on the cover](https://imgur.com/a/DNON5VW).
Dogs were intended as practical workers. 

Pavlov, he of the ringing bell and salivating dog experiment, commissioned a ""monument"" in 1934 with the inscription

>The dog, thanks to its long-established friendly disposition towards man, its cleverness, patience and obedience, serves the experimenter, with considerable pleasure in fact, for many years, and sometimes even for the whole of its life.

essentially articulating that it is quite normal for dogs to be willing to undergo self-sacrifice.

Stories re-inforced the lessons of the hardy dogs. The 1939 story _Smoke in the Forest_
by the writer Arkady Gaidar involves a boy lost in a forest who has a dog
with him (Brutik) who turns out to be as terrible at navigation as the boy;
the story's implication (based on an event earlier with a girl feeding the dog a sweet) is that the dog was ruined by being pampered, spoiling the dog's potential usefulness.

A 1940 pamphlet explicitly stated

>A dog is not an amusement, but the friend and helper of man at work.

Post-WWII, attitudes started to change. This was a general loosening of the post-Revolution mindset; by the time of Stalin's death the vet clinic in Moscow treated 36,000 pets a year (not just dogs, but cats, squirrels, hedgehogs, and birds). Post-Stalin specifically led to an era of more emphasis on private (rather than just collective) spaces, with emphasis shifted from utility to family relationships and warm friendship. To emphasize the congruence with Soviet ideals, Engels was quoted.

>The dog and the horse, by association with man, have developed such a good ear for articulate speech that they easily learn to understand any language within the range of their circle of ideas. Moreover, they have acquired the capacity for feelings, such as affection for man, gratitude, etc., which were previously foreign to them.

""Lap dogs"" still only entered in cautiously, but they eventually made a comeback by the 1970s; the Soviets essentially lived in a paradoxical state where pets were approved of but needed to be justified at the same time. Stories by the *neopochvennestvo* writers of the 1970s (emphasizing rural tradition) used themes about the loss of connection with nature that urban life gave, claiming that peasants had the real connection with animals.

One more example that is very Soviet, back in time a little to the 50s and the first of the space launches, done with dogs. Laika was the first to go into orbit. Those who built Sputnik II knew that Laika was not going to survive re-entry; however, the Soviet government claimed that Laika had suffered from unintentional oxygen depletion had to be euthanized. So she was still a hero dog and martyr, but it was unacceptable to present what really happened -- that the engineers knew she was going to die, despite the ""noble sacrifice"" attitude of only 20 years before -- until long after the fall of the Soviet Union, in 2002.

AskHistorians,"The last known auroch only died in 1627. There were royal restrictions on hunting them as early as the 1200s. How did 400 years of proto-conservation fail for such a high status, visible animal?","I wrote a feature on de-extinction of aurochs for the Washington Post a few years back and had the opportunity to talk to a lot of experts and read up on the history of the aurochs, so I think I can help you out here.

The aurochs was probably more a creature of open plains and mosaic landscapes of plains mixed with scrubby and forested patches. The old growth forests that the species is described as living in for the last thousand years or so of its history were not a preferred habitat -- these were just the only places left where they could exist at all.

The remnant population in Poland was surviving on food and in habitat that was probably less than ideal. More importantly, they became genetically isolated and seriously inbred. We don't have specific data about the genes of very many of those animals, nor do we have reports from biologists on their health. But we do know what usually happens to mammals that face a prolonged genetic bottleneck like that. Look at the blackfooted ferret for a modern example. Sperm motility is low, many males are cryptorchids, which is to say that they are missing one or both testicles. Natural reproduction drops. 

Population dynamics are a numbers game in the long run. Even if you have a group of animals that look ok, if their rate of reproduction drops so low that they can't keep pace with adult animals dying of old age then eventually they are going to disappear. 

Here's the piece I wrote on the subject:

AskHistorians,"In the video game Red Dead Redemption 2 (set in 1899), a criminal gang steals physical paper bonds from the personal train carriage of a railway magnate. What was the process of selling stolen bonds in those days?","There were several major bank burglaries in the late 19th century, most of which involved large quantities of bonds in addition to cash. The sources for most of these are rather unreliable since they involve the memoirs and reminisces of the criminals involved, accounts by police, and sensational newspaper stories. For example, the Ocean National Bank in 1869 ($800K), Northampton Bank in 1876 ($1.6M), and the robbery of the Manhattan Savings Institution in 1878 for almost $3M. In all three cases the majority of the value was in bonds and other securities.

Most of the bonds involved were coupon bonds and securities issued by the US and various state governments, were registered to the bank as an owner, and thus couldn't be disposed of as easily as bearer bonds. For the Manhattan Savings Institution a detailed list of the securities can be found in Byrnes' *Professional Criminals of America*.

In the case of the Manhattan Savings Institution, the US and New York governments cancelled and reissued the US Treasury and New York State bonds involved, making them worthless to the robbers. Other banks would issue notices containing a list of the bonds stolen and their serial numbers as a way of alerting other banks not to accept them or redeem the coupons. In many cases though, the burglars would contact the bank through an intermediary and offer to sell the bonds back at between 20 and 30 cents on the dollar. The banks usually accepted, considering it a bargain, and would decline to cooperate with the police.

The police, needless to say, did not think much of such arrangements but the legal system at the time gave victims considerable latitude and banks were generally glad to have most of the money back and not endure further bad publicity. It's something of a recurring theme in Byrne of victims either dropping charges or criminals receiving reduced sentences in return for the proceeds of the crime.

Late 19th century readers loved true crime books, judging by the large number of them published. They are of highly variable quality and needed to be taken with a grain (or a large block) of salt. Byrnes, Eldridge, and Pinkerton write from a law enforcement perspective, while Sophie Lyons is one of the few representatives from the criminal side. Byrnes seems to be the most reliable of the three. Contrary to the title of her book, crime paid very well for Sophie Lyons who died a rich woman. She is also exceedingly unreliable (but very entertaining) as documented in Davidson's recent biography. Guilfoyle is a good, fairly recent overview of crime in 19th century New York.

AskHistorians,Is there such a thing as a history of dreams ? Do we know what people in the middle ages dreamt about and what did they think it meant ?,"There is a migratory legend (ML 4000, ""The Soul of a Sleeping Person Wanders on its Own""), which appears in at least two medieval documents, demonstrating that the narrative is old. This is a legend about a dream, rather than a dream in itself, but it reveals what people felt was reasonable and possible for a dream. It also offers insight into at least one idea floating about about what dreams represented.

This is an excerpt from my [Introduction to Folklore](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Folklore-Traditional-Studies-Elsewhere/dp/1521423261), which I used once upon a time when teaching folklore at university:

>The attempt to find a synthesis between pre-conversion European culture and Christianity was a process that involved all levels of society. A charming example of this occurs in the Inquisition Register of Jacques Fournier, a document that Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie made famous in his book Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error (1979). The fourteenth-century register records a story told by Philippe d’Alayrac of Coustaussa in the French Pyrenees. The excerpt refers to “believers,” members of the Albigensian heresy, a movement outlawed by Rome. The tale unfolds as follows:

>""Once upon a time, two believers found themselves close to a river. One of them fell asleep. The other stayed awake, and from the mouth of the sleeper he saw emerge a creature like a lizard. Suddenly the lizard, using a plank (or was it a straw?), which stretched from one bank to the other, crossed the river. On the other bank there was a fleshless skull of an ass. And the lizard ran in and out of the openings of the skull. Then it came back over the plank and re-entered the sleeper’s mouth. It did that once or twice. Seeing which, the man who was awake thought of a trick: he waited until the lizard was on the other side of the river and approaching the ass’s skull. And then he took away the plank! The lizard left the ass’s head and returned to the bank. But he could not get across! The plank was gone! Then the body of the sleeper began to thrash about, but it was unable to wake, despite the efforts of the watcher to arouse it from its sleep. Finally the watcher put the plank across the river. Then the lizard was able to get back and re-enter the body of the sleeper through the mouth. The sleeper immediately awoke, and he told his friend the dream he had just had.

>""‘I dreamed,’ he said, ‘that I was crossing a river on a plank; then I went into a great palace with many towers and rooms, and when I wanted to come back to the place from which I had set out, there was no plank! I could not get across: I would have been drowned in the river. That was why I thrashed about (in my sleep). Until the plank was put back again and I could return.

>""The two believers wondered greatly at this adventure, and went and told it to a parfait [a heretical priest], who gave them the key to the mystery: the soul, he told them, remains in a man’s body all the time; but a man’s spirit or mind goes in and out, just like lizard which went from the sleeper’s mouth to the ass’s head and vice versa.""

>This story is a variant of a popular European legend commonly called “The Guntram Legend” after its oldest recorded example, which appears in the “History of the Longobards” of Paul the Deacon (d. 790). Christiansen classifies the story as Migratory Legend 4000, “The Soul of a Sleeping Person Wanders on its Own.” For the most part, the tale of Philippe d’Alayrac is an unexceptional variant of this legend. The interpretation that the parfait provides, however, is unique. He explains the legend as a testimonial to the existence of the duality of the soul, a concept that suited his heretical purposes. For most of the peasantry, the ancient legend was simply a testimony to the belief that the soul can occasionally leave the body, and when it does, it assumes the form of an animal. The parfait was trying to reconcile two conflicting traditions – his form of Christianity and the pre-conversion legend.

>The peasants must have been frustrated at times when seeking to find a place for their pre-Christian beliefs in the Christian cosmology. Many of these attempts were likely failures, causing the pagan tradition either to die out or to live on in a tenuous way. For example, although the European peasants knew of no reason to reject the Christian abstraction of good and evil, they could never assimilate it completely, and the concept continually conflicted in subtle ways with many of the beliefs that survived conversion. European civilization does not always represent the synthesis of different cultures but rather an uneasy coexistence."
AskHistorians,What was the plan if D-Day had failed?,"There was a plan of evacuation _even on successful landing_. The plan had been -- once it was realized it just wouldn't be practical nor conducive to survival to treat the wounded on the beach -- to evacuate the wounded back to England.

The essential nature of the invasion gave the
medical support planners great difficulty. They anticipated
12% wounded on landing day, followed by 6.5 percent
on the following two days after, meaning
7,200 wounded needed to be treated on D-Day itself. And
this is with the assumption that the Germans would stick
to conventional warfare; General Albert W. Kenner (lead
medical officer for both Torch and Overlord) grimly noted

>If gas should be used, then these figures go by the board.

There would be simply too many wounded -- and too many medics and too much equipment needed -- to do treatment on the landing shores. This was worked out even in the earliest planning stages when Operation Roundup (1942) was considered.

There weren't many hospital ships available, and while the British had developed a
hospital carrier they didn't have anywhere close to capacity (in 1942 there were 4 of
them, and each could hold about 250 patients, assuming 100 of them on litters). The
carriers were additionally slow and vulnerable to enemy fire.

The recommendation of the medical staff for Roundup was to re-use the landing craft
as transport back; this had the extra dilemma of if they could somehow be given
Red Cross designation.

For Overlord, the decision was eventually to use landing-ship-tanks, LSTs, [which could go right to the beach](https://history.army.mil/images/reference/normandy/ts/md/166.jpg). They could each theoretically hold 600 wounded (300 in litters) and they were sufficient number, with 83 out of 98 American-designated ships and 70 out of 113 British-designated ones assigned to the task. This force was augmented with 5 hospital carriers who could handle more extreme cases of emergency (where surgery needed to be done immediately and it was not possible to wait for transport back to England). [You can see a visual plan of how evacuation would work here](https://history.army.mil/images/reference/normandy/ts/md/169.jpg).

Units landings were spread out over time; considering just Omaha, there were 12
surgical teams, the 1st Medical Depot Company, and the 13th Field Hospital; this
was to be followed two days later by the 51st Field Company; and 3 more days later
by Collecting Companies, and Ambulance Company, and two Evacuation Hospitals.

In general, there was definitely the heavy thought of failure, but it was assumed that the beach is where the failure would happen. Quoting an unpublished manuscript by Eisenhower, regarding Churchill:

>Many weeks were to pass, however, before he [Churchill] expressed sustained confidence in the venture. One remark he frequently repeated was that if we could be sure of safe landings at most of the five beaches to be attacked, and the Allies could soon move their 30-odd available divisions to Normandy, securing the Cotentin Peninsula and a sizeable portion of the Normandy coast, he would at that point publicly say that OVERLORD had been a well-conceived and worthwhile operation.

Eisenhower himself famously wrote [a speech in case invasion failed](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/186470), implying that the landings ""failed to gain a satisfactory foothold"". Therefore, if there was an evacuation to be had, it was to be handled by the plan led by General Kenner and the medical staff.

One other element to consider is evacuation by air. Helicopters were not available, but the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons started evacuations four days after landing. C-47s and C-53s with litter support were used. Planes could support 18 litters (if they used an older metal rack) or 24 litters (if they used a newly-developed web-strap support); across the European continent there spread a complex ""evacuation chain"" [which you can see a map of here](https://imgur.com/a/LcH11bJ). A nurse with the 813 [recalls a landing 18 days after D-Day](https://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/News/Display/Article/582699/aeromedical-evacuation-from-normandy/):

>Wearing gas mask, helmet and carrying a canteen full of water, we flew into the beautiful sunrise over the English Channel. Sitting on bombs and barrels of gasoline, we landed at Omaha Beach, France on a bull-dozed air strip. When the dust settled and the C-47's door opened, there were hundreds of white crosses. There lay broken dreams: sweethearts, husbands, fathers, sons. Young men all with aspirations and plans for the future gone.

...

BONUS NOTE: It looks like many people want to interpret the question differently; while the text of the original question is asking about evacuation plans rather than theoretical future battle plans, there was a plan the Allies may have fallen back on had it been necessary: Operation Rankin. This was endorsed by the British early before Overlord was firmly established as the candidate; I am not a military grand strategy expert so someone else will have to speak to details, but it essentially involved a ""nibble at the external regions"" type attack, with potential regions proposed like Norway or the Balkans. If this would actually have happened is far too much in what-if speculation to be certain.

AskHistorians,How wild would a medieval forest like the Black Forest in Germany actually be?,"The answer is no, by the medieval period in Europe, forests were still rural places, but were largely not unexplored dark lawless places where only brave adventurers would tread.    

There were *some* instances of large wild areas that were largely empty , but in general  humans had spread through much of medieval Europe and very much tended to want to keep their surrounding areas relatively safe.  People don't really like living in places where they can be victimized by those hiding in the forest next door.  Also,  depending on the population density of particular areas, even many ""deep dark forests"" were littered with small towns and various settlements.  

You specifically reference the black forest and I'll get to that.  But in England, we actually have decent records of forest land.  In 1086 William the Conqueror ordered a survey of much of England and Wales.  The results of thsi survey eventually became known as the [Domesday Book](https://opendomesday.org/) so described because the results were final and inalterable, much like god's judgment on Doomsday.   

That book described that in the 11th century, England was only roughly 15% forested.   in the years following the Norman conquest the population of England increased dramatically and that number continued to drop as forests were cleared for farmland and woodcutting.   By the 13th century the forested percentage had dropped to [4-5%.](https://www.historyextra.com/period/early-medieval/ancient-forests/)    Incidentally, it's back up to about [13%](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/statistics-by-topic/woodland-statistics/#:~:text=Key%20findings,and%209%25%20in%20Northern%20Ireland.) today. 

At the same time, although these two trends are not directly connected.  After the norman Conquest, William the Conqurer and his successors often specifically issued decrees that set aside tracts of land and declared them to be  ""Royal Forests.""  These forests were protected by laws.     As much as 1/3rd of the forested land in southern england was protected Royal Forest.   In particular, hunting in the forest was prohibited. 

Originally, few things were allowed in the Royal Forest. Commoners could be hassled for merely traveling and accused of poaching. But in 1217 (two years after the Magna Carta) the Charter of the Forest set forth laws to regulate permitted uses of the forest.   Commoners were granted the free right to use water and cut wood and hunt inside royal forests.   The forest charter actually stood as a statute of England until 1971.  

One of these infamous royal forests was ""Sherwood forest,"" which was about 19,000 acres (7800 hectares) in Nottinghamshire. It was about 25% of the land inside the County.  But the forest was not uninhabited. There were roads and settlement throughout the forest.   It is an area only about 6 miles on a side. 

While it's certainly not impossible that bandits could hide inside a 19,000 acre forest. On pathways such a forest can be walked across in a day and ridden across in a few hours.  

By Comparison, for US based readers at least, 19,000 acres would make the forest smaller than most US national parks.   Virgin Islands National Park is 14,900 acres.  Haleakala National Park in Hawaii is 33,200 acres.  Yellowstone National park is 2.2 million acres.  Grand Canyon National Park is 1.2 million. Yosemite is 761,800.  

So at least when we're talking about medieval England, yes, forests existed, but no, they were not generally vast places where the people of that era feared to tread. (Except if they were afraid of being arrested for poaching). 

Now, you specifically asked about the Black Forest.  Much like the english forests of that era, the Black forest was absolutely littered with small settlements, farms and various agriculture.  [In Fact, the 1525 German Peasants Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Peasants%27_War) began in the southern portion of the Black Forest.   It IS quite a bit larger than the english forests, with an area of about 2200 square miles.  (6000 sq km) or 1.4 million acres. roughly the size of Grand Canyon National Park, a bit smaller than Yellowstone.  

Now, *part* of the mythos of dark savage forests might actually date back to the [Roman era.](https://www.schwarzwaldportal.com/en/history.html)  Because when the Romans occupied the area, they largely did not colonize the forest, but stuck to the outskirts, and the forest itself was largely inhabited by Germanic peoples from the Alemanni.  That likely did create a bit of cultural tension, as the Romans would have feared and protected themselves against the Alemanni and Marcomanni living in the forest as part of ongoing roman conflict with Germanic peoples.  It's very likely that there would have been occasional raids or low intensity warfare launched from inside the forest. 

But by the medieval period, the forest was again, largely populated by farmers and woodcutters and miners who, due to their rural lifestyles, did tend to have their own culture.  It might have been a rural place, but it was not a place that people feared to tread because a great many people lived and conducted their lives in the forest every day.  

So where does the Myth of the ""dark forest"" come from?  Well, to some extent it's actual folklore that predates the stories of the Brothers Grimm.    Germanic and Norse folklore dating back into the premodern era contained the term ""Myrkviðr"" which is an old norse term for ""Dark wood.""   If you try to pronounce it, you might get a hint of familiarity.  It anglicizes into the word ""Mirkwood,"" which was written by William Morris and popularized by JRR Tolkein in his books.   The term is used all the way back to the Poetic Edda, and is used in various different contexts to describe forests in Southwestern Germany/Austria, Forests across Northern Ukraine and into Russia in the time of the goths and Huns  The Kolmarden Forest in Sweden, and other forests in Southern Sweden. 

This is where history verges into prehistory and speculation.  But It is somewhat *more* likely in prehistoric Europe, with a lower population, that forests would have been the kind of places that spawned myths and legends abut what you might find if you walked for days."

AskHistorians,"In the Village People song, ""YMCA"", the group describes that you can ""stay there"" to ""get yourself clean"" and ""have a good meal"" at the Y. How has the mission of the YMCA changed since 1978 and was the song an accurate reflection of the practices in 1978?","Yes, many big-city YMCAs (and YWCAs) offered dormitory and restaurant facilities, beginning in the 1890s and waning in the 1990s. The Y as a source of low-cost lodgings was familiar to most Americans in the 1970s.

YMCA’s beginnings were in London, in 1844 in the throes of the Industrial Revolution. One of the young men who’d come to the city for work, 22-year-old George Williams, joined with 11 friends to organize the first YMCA as a “refuge for young men seeking escape from the hazards of life on the streets.”

The need for a similar  “home away from home” for sailors and merchants inspired the first US YMCA (1851) at the Old South Church in Boston. Though the YMCA initially focused on religious outreach, by the 1860s the need for safe and affordable lodging for young men moving from rural areas to big cities was apparent, and the first YMCA dormitory, with 42 rooms, opened in 1867 in Chicago. It was destroyed by the city’s Great Fire of 1871, and doesn’t appear to have been rebuilt.

At roughly the same time, the New York YMCA adopted as its mission the “fourfold purpose”: ""The improvement of the spiritual, mental, social and *physical condition* of young men."" In 1869, the first YMCA buildings constructed with gymnasiums opened; swimming pools followed in the 1880s when technology allowed. To observers of the time, the parallels between YMCAs and business men’s clubs—also with pools, gyms, and sleeping rooms—would have been clear.

The link between dubious rooming houses and prostitution or other evils was obvious for young women moving to big cities. For young men, the link between cheap hotels full of itinerant workers and alcoholism and moral decay was hard for religious and moral leaders to ignore. Though Ys in some cities had experimented with dormitories after the Chicago example, they didn’t become widespread until the 1890s—and then, seemingly, more as an income-producing device rather than a social service. 
By 1910, 281 YMCAs reported almost 9,000 beds; a decade later there were nearly 50,000. Chicago’s YMCA Hotel opened in 1916 with 1,821 rooms, and expanded to 2,700 rooms a decade later (it closed in 1979). Between 1922 and 1940, YMCA lodgings grew from about 55,000 to over 100,000 rooms.

In an era when many bars offered a free lunch to entice drinkers, lunchrooms in Ys were thought of, in part, as a temperance offering. The growth of “railroad YMCAs” in the US led to the expansion of food service. Seaports since antiquity had offered inexpensive lodgings and meals to sailors in port for a few days, but now such facilities were also in demand near big-city railroad stations to serve the “extra-board” part-time workers, day-laborers, and traveling crews employed by railroads.

Meanwhile, the YMCA’s educational mission led to various classes, often vocational in nature, but by the mid 20th century some had become [degree-granting universities,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities_and_colleges_founded_by_the_YMCA) most of which have now been merged with other educational institutions.

After World War II, the Y’s mission of serving—and saving—the young men freshly arrived in the dangerous, overwhelming industrial city had faded, and its programs became more diffuse, including camping programs for children. Nonetheless, even suburban YMCAs often included sleeping rooms as part of their postwar building program.

By the 1980s, many had become what we would today characterize as “single-room-occupancy hotels,” low-cost lodgings primarily occupied month after month by the same long-term residents. Big-city Ys where I stayed as a thrifty grad student often seemed to manage their occupancy accordingly, with perhaps eight floors of long-termers and a couple of floors—seemingly brighter and nicer—for us short-term visitors from out of town.

And yes, as a young gay man, I was well aware that lingering glances in the showers, in the gym, even in the lunchroom, might (and on occasion did) lead to more (of course, that was also true in places other than YMCAs). Some of my gay friends, who could have exercised at other athletic facilities, chose to have YMCA memberships precisely because of the self-selection potential with other likeminded members. That’s exactly the affiliation the song references.

AskHistorians,"In traditional Hawaiian culture women would be put to death for eating pork, coconuts, taro, several types of fish, and 67 out of 70 varieties of bananas. What did Hawaiian women subsist off of? Why was there such a drastic limitation on what women could eat?","Anthropologist of South Pacific foodways here.

Hawaii is not my specialty (it is more around Micronesia and the general area of French Polynesia and similar islands), but I feel qualified to answer this as I know a little about Hawaiian foodways and many South Pacific traditional staple foods and agriculture are similar.

First off, I will break this down into two categories, carbohydrates and proteins.

Carbohydrates in traditional diets make up the bulk of caloric intake for South Pacific populations. This is principally in the form of root crops, breadfruit, and bananas, with the cultural and caloric importance of each varying between islands and cultural groups.

Now I don't know if in Hawaii those three varieties of permissible bananas for women were important to their diet, but even if they were not there exists plenty of other sources of carbohydrates.

Indeed, taro is a root crop and in many South Pacific cultures the preferred food, but several other types of root crops were cultivated as staples. Among these:

* Three species of yams in Polynesia, with more existing in other parts of the South Pacific, only one of which was a major staple (Dioscorea alata) while the other two more or less famine foods consumed in harsh times.
* Sweet potato, introduced to the region hundreds of years before European contact, I do happen to know Hawaii was one of the islands which integrated this crop the most in its diet and agricultural system as a veritably important source of food
* Giant taro, a historically important root crop cultivated in large swathes over the South Pacific, including in Hawaii. Needs to be cooked or processed thoroughly as it contains many raphides (much more than taro), but historically as been one of the principal sources of calories in the South Pacific. In some islands, though none Polynesian I am aware of, it is even preferred over taro.
* Giant swamp taro, similar function of the giant taro, generally the traditional staple root crop of South Pacific atolls as it grows well in the somewhat brackish and marshy freshwater lens aquifers of atolls. As far as I know this was not important in Hawaii, if it was cultivated at all.
* Malanga (cocoyam) and Sweet cassava, which can be consumed as the root without the extraction process bitter cassavas require, were introduced post European contact.

Keep in mind that all these crops were cultivated in many different varieties and thus with only one species but various varieties you can have access to a large array of nutritional profiles, with for instance one variety rich in vitamin A and another in antioxidant.

It is also ***fundamental*** to not forget nor underestimate the breadfruit. This tree exists as well in countless of varieties all over the South Pacific, and was an immensely important staple food and source of calories and nutrition in huge parts of the region, including Hawaii. The volume of food produced by breadfruits is impressive, and it literally grows on trees. It is literally a giant crop of starch that grows in huge balls on trees as fruits. It is seasonal, but several methods of breadfruit preservation exist, and in many islands the breadfruit season is recognised as the season of abundance and when people eat very much and grow fatter (to clarify, this is seen as a positive thing), whilst in opposition the other part of the year is seen more as a lean season where more work is required to produce less food. Generally speaking, there exists two breadfruit seasons, a major and a minor one. Do not underestimate the breadfruit my friends. I am sure my fellow Caribbeans will also agree with me we also share an enthusiasm for this wonderful tree along with our friends from another ocean on the other side of the world.

And now for the proteins, which pre-European-contact in Polynesia consisted of four sources:

* Pork, which as established was not permitted for consumption by women, in reality was in the whole of the region a feast meal and display of wealth, power, and celebration. Indeed at feasts large quantities of pork were eaten, but it was not an everyday meal and therefore not the principal source of protein.
* Chicken, which were an occasional source of protein but like pork not everyday, although it does not hold a symbolic importance akin to pork.
* Maritime sources of protein as the most important. You say several types of fishes were prohibited for women, but the varieties and abundance of food collected in South Pacific maritime systems is enormous. Not only fishes (which many species could be consumed by Hawaiian women without breaking taboos, but also species such as several types of molluscs which were consumed in large quantities).
* And finally, hunting terrestrial and semi-terrestrial animals, ranging from land crabs to coconut crabs to multiple birds (which in many islands depending on epochs seemed to have been particularly important in South Pacific diets).

Vegetal protein as you can see can be considered for all practical purposes not present in the traditional diets, especially as traditional systems of agriculture did not utilise many legumes, and when they did they provided more carbohydrates than proteins (as in the the case the Polynesian chestnut trees).

Fats and other sources of nutrition also were consumed usually in vegetal form, of course an important source being coconuts which Hawaiian women would not have been able to consume, but also using crops such as candlenuts (the famous Hawaiian kui-kui).

Fruits such as Pandanus and noni, among others, would have provided other sources of nutrition, both raw and processed (pandanus paste or noni juice for instance).

Finally, I use a lot of past tense in this response, and I want to clarify it is not because I wish to position Polynesians or other Pacific people are pertaining to the past, but uniquely because I am talking about pre-contact agricultural systems and foodways.

EDIT: Wooo many questions, I will answer them but it is late where I am right now and I am waking up at 4am and will be all day in rural valleys without signal or free time for my work, so I will try to answer all of them tomorrow night but likely I will come back very very late so most likely I will answer them Friday when I have time."
AskHistorians,"Enzo Ferrari is reputed to have said: “Ask a child to draw a car, and certainly he will draw it red.” How did we come to associate race cars with the colour red? Is it the result of Ferrari?","*Rosso corsa* pre-dates Ferrari. In the first half of the 20th century, it was customary for cars to be painted in the “national colours” of the competing country (Marque or driver). This was largely supplanted in the commercial era by sponsor paint jobs, but still remains significant in some cases. For example, Mercedes-Benz F1 team is nicknamed *Silver Arrows* after the erstwhile German colours, Alpine F1 features the *Bleu de France*, Aston-Martin competes in *British Racing Green*, and of course Ferrari competes in *Rosso corsa* or whatever Marlboro shade approximates it.

Rosso Corsa dates back to the 10,000-mile 1907 Peking to Paris race, held for bragging rights to the first motor crossing of Asia, which was won by Prince Scipione Borghese, accompanied by his chauffeur Ettore Guizzardi and journalist Luigi Barzini in a red 7.4-litre Itala, with a lead of 20 days even after a few hundred miles' detour to St Petersburg to attend a dinner. Of such achievements were national reputations made - Barzini's account, *Peking to Paris*, was published simultaneously in 11 languages - and in tribute to the Prince's red Itala, Italian competitors from that point entered red cars in international events.

For those who equate ""race car"" with ""Ferrari"" or another Italian marque, then yes, race cars are red. At the time of the quote, Italians were on a high so it’s not so much a quote about Ferrari as it is the supremacy of Italian motorsport.

Indeed there was, but it was not mandatory (that didn’t arrive until 2003). In the Soviet Union almost all forms of personal and corporate insurance (for example for Soviet foreign trade flows) were done via GosStrakh (Gosudarstvennoye Strakhovanie, State Insurance, or Central Directorate for State Insurance of the Soviet Union, though it literally reads “StateFear”, which was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance), and was officially established in 1921 (and was officially given state monopoly on all forms of insurance in 1925).

The early 1920s also saw the introduction of mandatory insurance requirements for certain types of property and goods - horses, livestock, detached housing, and crops. 

In 1926 GosStrakh first introduced voluntary personal transportation insurance coverage for cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, motorboats, and tractors (and later snowmobiles). However, it was not mandatory, and quite very rare at the time, as car ownership was very limited in the Soviet Union until after the Second World War, which saw not only an influx of “imported” trophy vehicles from Germany and land-leased machinery like the Willys MB jeeps, but also the start of mass serial production of domestic designs such as the GAZ-20 Pobeda and Moskvich 400, the former being a mostly Soviet design, and the latter being largely based on the Opel Kadett, after much of its original tooling was included in the German reparations package. From GosStrakh’s figures, it issued 99 personal vehicle insurance policies in 1946, and over 1500 in 1950. At the same time, the number of mandatory insurance categories was increasing, though mostly for enterprises, so for most Soviet citizens insurance plans never really became commonplace. 

With the cars becoming more accessible to an average Soviet citizen the numbers of voluntary automobile insurance policies taken out also started to grow, and you would often see advertisements for various GosStrakh insurance [plans in magazines and elsewhere. ](https://web.archive.org/web/20190123040230/http://rgsmuseum.ru/)Automobile insurance plans at the time included coverage for damage from traffic accidents and natural disasters, but not thefts or injuries. 

In 1958 GosStrakh authority was devolved down to individual State Insurance agencies in constituent Soviet republics, all under the jurisdiction of their respective republican Ministry of Finance, but still operating under a unified Soviet-wide legal base to harmonize insurance frameworks throughout the country, including for personal vehicles. 

In 1962 and 1963 the Soviet Council of Ministers rejected several proposals for introducing various forms of mandatory automobile insurance, deeming them economically unnecessary. 1960s and early 1970s saw a notable expansion and diversification of coverage types and policies, with an upsurge in rates of optional (voluntary) insurance coverage, especially life insurance. For personal vehicles, in 1969 GosStrakh introduced coverage for theft as well, and in 1986 it also introduced combined insurance plans, covering the vehicle, luggage, and death insurance for the driver in an event of an accident (and in 1989 also for injury). 

I can’t find definitive figures online at the moment, but it seems that by the late 1970s-early 1980s about 10% of personal vehicles were insured throughout the Soviet Union (rising to over 30% in Moscow), including over 3 million cars (up from around 340.000 as of 1970). I don’t have the exact figures, so it’s unclear how many of those 10% were cars at that point, but it’s generally accepted that by the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, there were just under 17 million cars registered in the Soviet Union, only around 6 million of which were insured (EDIT: due to uncertainty over the figures, it can also mean 6 million vehicles, including state-owned, which would not always overlap with the 17 million figure, as it would only include privately owned and registered cars, not motorcycles and other vehicles), which may include motorcycles and other vehicles, but would still mostly consist of privately owned cars. 

A typical automobile insurance plan around that time (1980s) would cost about 30-50 roubles in yearly premiums (with average monthly wages somewhere in the region of 170 roubles), with typical coverage of up to 3000-3500 roubles in damages, which would cover most of the repair costs one would be likely to be saddled with in a typical accident. For example the then-newly-released Moskvich-412 cost around 5000 roubles when new. The payouts would normally be straightforward, not too dissimilar from what you’d have in the West, but you might be refused coverage under certain circumstances, for example if you had prior convictions. The police accident reports became integrated into the payout process in the late 1980s, taking into consideration factors like alcohol consumption at the time of the accident, road conditions, at fault status, and so on.

It’s also worth noting that while there were far fewer cars on Soviet roads than there are now, road safety was still thought to be appalling, partially due to poor roads, and partially due to low driving standards and comparatively high levels of alcoholism. Interestingly, many of the documents containing relevant traffic accident statistics from the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs pertaining to Traffic Police were either never declassified, or only partially declassified.

EDIT: expanding on the topic of liability, as pointed out by commenter: 

Under Soviet laws (for most of its existence) liability in road accidents was usually imposed regardless of fault of the tort feasor, where the owner of the vehicle is liable for damages incurred (important, as in many cases the driver would not necessarily be the owner of the vehicle in question) to the injured (or otherwise adversely affected) party. In accidents involving multiple vehicles the liability would fall on the at-fault party (specifically the owner of the at-fault vehicle), while in all cases with the liability covering injuries (medical costs not otherwise recoverable, which is important with socialized healthcare system that was in place in theory) and/or property damage suffered by the injured party. 

Conversely speaking (as the road accident data for most of the Soviet period is unavailable), for most of Soviet history, number of cars was low enough that most road injuries and fatalities would only likely involve one vehicle crashing or running someone or something over, many of those vehicles not being owned by the driver.

The liability did not cover lost wages per se, but was intended to restore the injured party to the same material conditions they enjoyed prior to injury/accident, but in practice would most often amount to the difference between the injured party's previous earnings, and the pension received after the injury (in case of the injured party being rendered incapable of performing the same work), as well as otherwise unrecoverable medical and rehabilitation costs.

Again, this liability would fall on the owner of the vehicle, and vehicle ownership was usually beyond the means of most Soviet citizens, with a huge number of vehicles owned by the state (trucks, tractors, vans, etc), in which case the burden of damages and liability was easier and would rarely go through a drawn-out judicial process (if at all), as those costs would normally be minor for the owner (in most cases some state enterprise). Insurance could also come into play here, as, depending on the time period, and the vehicle in question, it would either be mandatorily insured as state property, or could potentially be covered by optional state insurance that could cover some of the costs, depending on the coverage.

However, the owner of the vehicle could be freed from liability if they can successfully establish a defence based on, for example, the assertion that the loss was exclusively the fault of the injured or third party for which the owner of the vehicle cannot be held responsible, or that some irresistible forces that the owner could not foresee or forestall are involved.

It gets more complicated if the owner is an individual, as both the at-fault and injured parties would then often be required to bear a burden, as the compensation would take into consideration the financial condition of the at-fault party, and the damages scaled down to the capacity for payment. This is where individual insurance would come in play, as while it almost never included liability, it could improve the ability of the tort feasor (at-fault party) to pay the injured one. However, as I said in the main response, relatively few Soviet motorists were insured in any capacity, much less with liability coverage.


To the best of my knowledge, much of GosStrakh automobile liability insurance coverage was actually through its foreign arm, the InGosStrakh, which provided liability insurance for foreigners residing in the Soviet Union, based largely on foreign practices, but I have very limited knowledge of this, and have no real sources on that topic in particular.

If you want to read more on the subject, the only good source that touches on the topic of automobile insurance in English that I was able to find is ""Insurance in the Soviet Union"" by Paul P. Rogers (New York: Praeger, 1986)."
AskHistorians,"How did Lacrosse, originally a Native American sport, become so strongly associated with private schools and colleges in the US?","I'm definitely not informed enough on the history of lacrosse as an organized sport among prep schools and colleges, however, the modern game originates with William George Beers, who is often credited as being the ""Father of Modern Lacrosse"" for establishing the first set rules of lacrosse in 1857.

I remember reading that early on, Canadian teams would play Haudenosaunee teams, mostly the Mohawks of Kahnawake near Quebec, and would get absolutely demolished, due to the modern game's style being based off of the Haudenosaunee style of the game (Many indigenous nations played a form of the game and has distinct names and various purposes culturally, the Haudenosaunee form is the one that just became popular.) It wasn't too long after that, ""Iroquois"" teams were banned from playing against Canadian teams because they were considered professionals. I believe I also read elsewhere, teams could be allowed to have 1 Iroquois player on their rosters to level the playing field, so to speak. 

So right off the bat, modern lacrosse isn't off to a good start with inclusion, especially of the people with which the game originates. This new sport was considered a ""gentleman's sport"", further adding to the affluent nature the game would take on. 

If I can take an educated guess as to why the game was really mostly played by prep schools and colleges? Cost, availability, and accessibility of equipment, particularly that of the lacrosse stick itself.

In the early days, the best quality sticks were being produced by Mohawks at Akwesasne. The process to make a wooden lacrosse stick of good quality takes anywhere from 6 months to a year from harvest, to steam beanding, curing, and carving and stringing. Frank Lally started the Lally Lacrosse Manufacturing Co. which employed all Mohawk workers at Akwesasne, and operated from the 1880s until WWII. I read that it was estimated ~90% of all lacrosse sticks during this period were produced at Akwesasne, mostly Lally's, and used throughout Canada, England, and the US.

What's interesting during this period as well is how rapidly stick technology evolved. The rules of lacrosse changed often, and thus the dimensions of sticks as well. Old lacrosse sticks from the late 1800's were often referred to as ""long-frames"" because of the long head area and short shaft (hah). Towards the 1930's, the head area becomes shorter and shaft longer. Box lacrosse, an indoor variant of the game played during the summer months to fill hockey arenas which would typically be vacant, also becomes popular in Canada at this time. Because of the narrower quarters, sticks in this game also evolve to be shorter and narrower in their frames to control the ball better.

So 2 styles of Lacrosse, Box and Field, played with different stick types, are being played by affluent people for the most part. Keep in mind, to be able to buy sticks and equipment in bulk to field a whole team, you had to have some money to shell out. It's far more accessible and cheaper to play football or baseball or any other sport if you don't have the means.

In the 1970's, the Mohawk Lacrosse Manufacturing Company factory burned down, halting wooden lacrosse stick production and distribution worldwide. Additionally, quality hickory trees used to create sticks were getting harder to source. In just a few short years, plastic heads with metal shafts began being produced by non-natives out of necessity, and it's been the standard since. One would think making sticks of easier to obtain materials would decrease the cost. Quite the opposite. Despite innovation in these sticks' quality and ability to produce them in larger volumes to meet demand, prices have only increased to today.

It's lacrosse's biggest barrier of entry; Cost. Helmet, pads, stick, and cleats, can run about $800+ with high end equipment. And then there's club fees, tournament fees, etc. Thousands more added on yearly. It's no wonder the game is not more popular. I will add that there are growing efforts to make the game more affordable not just here in the US, but also around the globe. There's also conscious efforts now to acknowledge the Indigenous roots of the game and rebranding the image of lacrosse away from prep school or frat boy culture, places of extreme privilege. But it will take more time and effort to work toward acessibility beyond those places.

One last thing I'll leave here; The early Iroquois teams that were banned from playing early on, what did they do? Well, they played each other. Mohawk reserves had enough men to field multiple teams, likewise at Six Nations Reserve. In NY, Onondaga, Newtown, and Tonawanda played among themselves and remain to this day some of the best players in the world against strong contenders like the US and Canada, places that tried to exclude them from a game that they've always played. The Haudenosaunee Nationals men's lacrosse team is ranked third in the world internationally among 79 countries. 

Hopefully this long-winded answer gives a little perspective of lacrosse's history and it's changing image today."

AskHistorians,"If Alexander the Great slept with a copy of the Iliad under his pillow, as according to legend, what would be the physical form of his copy - one compact scroll, a pile of scrolls, something else entirely?","It was almost certainly a scroll or a small set of scrolls.

Codices - books as we know them today - were an invention of the Roman imperial era. In Alexander's time, texts were typically written on papyrus scrolls. Although the dimensions varied considerably, the ""average"" scroll seems to have been about 12 feet long and 10 inches high. Especially when combined with large characters or wide margins, this format imposed fairly strict limits on the amount of text that could be written on a single scroll. Long works were thus divided into ""books"" - famous examples include the 142 books of Livy's history, the 15 books of Ovid's Metamorphoses, and (of course) the 24 books of Homer's Iliad.

The Iliad of Alexander's day was not yet divided into the now canonical 24 books; that happened after his death, in Hellenistic Alexandria. But it was, we assume, essentially the poem we know today in both substance and length. There were bulky editions of the Iliad, like the version written on a the skin of a gigantic Indian python (Zonaras 14.2). There were also novelty miniature versions, like the Iliad written literally in a nutshell (Pliny, Natural History 7.85). Most editions of the Iliad, however, probably consisted of nothing more or less than a dozen or so papyrus scrolls. 

Alexander had been fascinated by the Homeric epics since boyhood. One of his first acts after crossing into Asia Minor had been to visit the supposed site of Troy and reenact the funeral games of Patroclus, and after taking Gaza he reportedly had the Persian commander dragged behind a chariot like Hector (if we can believe Curtius 4.6.29). Alexander's former tutor Aristotle had composed or commissioned a special edition of the Iliad, which the king brought with him to Asia (Plutarch, Alexander 8.2; 26.2). We don't know, however, whether this was a full edition of the poem or a ""greatest hits"" compilation focused on Achilles, Alexander's favorite character. 

After his great victory at Issus, Alexander was presented with a jeweled casket from the treasures of Darius III. This, he decided, was a receptacle worthy of the Iliad, and the casket served thereafter as a carrying-case for his scrolls. (We don't know how large or elaborate it was, though I would guess it was a bit too bulky to fit under the king's pillow, as the scrolls themselves supposedly had.)

Whatever its precise format, Alexander's Iliad seems to have been eminently portable - perhaps only a few scrolls, traveling in the luxury of a Persian jewel box."
AskHistorians,"There are some semi-popular memes about going back in time to give medieval peasants things like Mt. Dew, Doritos, Warheads candy etc. The joke being that peasants would never have had that 'blast of flavor.' What would have been the biggest 'blast of flavor' they would have had back then?","Vinegar was common and easy to make and has been around since around 5000BC, in the 14th century there was even a guild of vinegar makers and recipes have been recorded.     While it would most likely have been more of the malt vinegar, made from stale beer, or apple cider vinegar, made from hard cider, style of vinegars and not white vinegar as that would have required distilling to make.  Vinegar was around and in use as a food preservative.  Fermentation to pickle food is also a common preservation practice and though the exact origins of the process are unknown, archaeologists believe ancient Mesopotamians pickled food as far back as 2400 B.C.    So a nice tangy lacto fermented pickles certainly existed The French Medieval household book Le Ménagier de Paris (the Goodman of Paris) had recipes for pickling walnuts and various vegetables and fruits.

While sugar would not have been common and available only in the later parts of the era, it was only really available to the very rich, honey most certainly was available and was a common sweetener used in the place of sugar jam recipes from Le Menagier de Paris includes Jam recipes using honey instead of sugar..   Medieval people loved their desserts and in fact they were the first to coin the phrase so sweet tasting foods sweetened with honey would not be a surprise to them, though for the poorer folk more of a treat for a special occasion than for daily consumption. 

Meat was usually salted for storage through the winter so salty flavors would not be new to people of that time either.    While the peasants daily pottage sounds plain, being a dish of basically boiled grains or legumes and vegetables (usually onions and leeks as they were considered food good only for poor people),   you have to remember that even the poor could grow herbs or forage for them and these would be added to the pottage, so so could include things like peppery watercress, parsley, sage, rosemary or thyme.   Horseradish is easy to grow (stopping it from taking over is the hard part) or forage, stores well and grated to serve with rare meat dishes.  If you've ever eaten raw horseradish, the spicy sinus clearing heat is not for the faint of heart.  Radishes have a delightful tangy pepperiness and are easy to grow and garlic was as popular at the time as it is now as a flavoring agent.   Fennel was also commonly grown provided a nice bright liquorice note to foods, then as it does now. 

Most people had access to dairy products, though rarely in the form of milk as the production of the dairy would be turned into cheeses and butter to help preserve it and while most of it would most likely be sold, some would be kept for home consumption.  Aged Cheddar cheese was first recorded as having been made in the 12th century and if you've ever had a bite of a nice aged piece of cheddar you know what a salivary gland achingly strong flavor that can have.   They don't call it Ol' Bitey or Ol' Croc when branding it now a days for nothing."
AskHistorians,"After watching many old westerns: Why didn't they just breed the cattle in Montana, and skip the whole business of driving them up from Texas?","They did breed cattle in Montana. However, numbers matter. Many more cattle can be raised in Texas (back then, and still now, the cattle capital of the USA) than in Montana - today, there are about 12.5 million cattle in Texas vs about 2.2 million cattle in Montana. If you want to buy cattle from ranchers so as to make money selling beef to the cities in the east, you will happily take as many Texas cattle as you can deal with and move, even if you are in Montana.

The problem with Texas was the lack of transport to move cattle and/or beef to the main markets (i.e., the large cities). In particular, the rail lines that were used to ship the cattle east didn't reach Texas - the main purpose of cattle drives was to take the cattle to the railways. Availability of grazing limited the routes that could be used for cattle drives, and the places where suitable routes for driving cattle intersected the railways could become important cattle industry centres. For example, Kansas was an important destination for cattle drives from Texas from 1867-1885. First, the major cattle town was Abilene, from which 35,000 cattle were shipped east in 1867, increasing to 600,000 per year in 1871 (which was enough to glut the beef market in the east). Just as the number of cattle shipped east per year from Abilene peaked, farms around the town blocked the cattle routes. In 1872, the industry then shifted to Ellsworth, Newton and Wichita - three towns due to three rival railroads. A few years later, in 1875, farms blocked the cattle routes to these towns. The industry then moved to Dodge City, until the importation of Texan cattle was banned in 1885. Even before this, Texan cattle drives went elsewhere (e.g., Nebraska) to take advantage of cheaper railroad transport than that offered by the Kansas Pacific Railroad.

As for Montana, Miles City was a temporary stopping place for Texan cattle, due to sufficient grazing to allow cattle to be fattened after the first part of their journey from Texas. When the Northern Pacific Railroad reached Miles City in 1881, it immediately became a major cattle town.

The end of the long-distance cattle drives from Texas came about when the rail lines reached Texas. Texas was first connected to the national rail network in 1873. The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company completed a line to Denison from the north in late 1872, and the Houston and Texas Central lines were extended to Denison in 1873, connecting Texas railways to the rest of the USA. Long-distance cattle drives still continued for many years, since the Texas rail network was concentrated in eastern Texas, and the small number of companies that controlled the railroads out of Texas colluded to push prices up (which could make out-of-state cattle drives to use other companies' railroads the cheaper option). In the 1890s, the state of Texas took steps to limit such corruption (the first laws aimed at such were passed in the 1870s, but were of limited effectiveness until the 1890s), and the Texas rail network continued to improve, so the long-distance cattle drives dwindled and vanished.

Local cattle drives continued, not only in Texas but also elsewhere, since cattle still had to be taken to the railways.

Extra note 1: In the 1850s, with the Gold Rush increasing demand in California, some Texan cattle drives went all the way to San Francisco. That's a long way, taking 5 months or more, but it meant that cattle that might sell for $5-10 in Texas could sell for $100 (or sometimes more) in California.

Extra note 2: When the cattle industry first became huge in north Mexico, there were no rail lines to take the cattle to large cities, and no refrigerated transport to allow beef to be moved in bulk by ship. Instead, the main exported product was leather, in great demand in European industry (e.g., for drives belts for various kinds of machinery in factories). Dried beef and beef tallow, essentially by-products of the leather industry, became very cheap locally. (Later, the industry collapsed due to degradation of grazing land due to overgrazing.) Without cattle drives, the Texas cattle industry would also have largely been limited to exporting leather until the Texan railway network became sufficiently developed. There's a lot more money in the industry when they can sell the insides of the cattle as well as the outsides in favourable markets. Cattle drives were all about money!"
AskHistorians,"King Edward I observed in 1277, that “the laws which the Irish use are detestable to God and so contrary to all laws that they ought not to be called laws”. What was so bad about Irish law to the English?","To understand what kind of problem the English might have had with Irish law during this time, you first have to understand what kinds of laws were actually in place. The Irish had a legal system known as Brehon Law which was enforced by “brehons” (or, judges, you might call them) and this system was in place from the early medieval period (between the fall of the roman empire in the 5th century and the Norman invasion in the 12th century) until the English eventually replaced it with English law in the early 17th century. Brehon Law was an oral tradition passed down between brehons and lawyers and developed over a period of centuries. It included a combination of past rulings by brehons and “customary laws” (those part of the traditions and customs of specific communities). The earliest written record we have of these oral Brehon laws come from Brehon Law Tracts which were recorded between the 7th and 12th centuries in Old Irish and which are now held at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, the British Library in London, and the Vatican Library in Rome. Brehon Law certainly predates even the earliest recordings, but it's not known by exactly how long.

Now let’s come to the question of what issue the English would have had with Brehon Law and why King Edward specifically described it as “detestable to god”. To answer this I feel I must provide the context of just how religious England was at this time. Remember, if you will, that the Church of England (which officially separated the English monarchy from the catholic church) wasn’t established until 1534 by King Henry VIII. So during this period in English history the predominant religion was Catholicism, meaning saying something was “detestable by god” might as well have had the caveat “…according to the Catholic church.” Another piece of necessary context: Catholicism was introduced to England through their occupation by the Roman Empire from 43 until their withdrawal in the early 5th century (the exact date isn’t known, but some believe it to have been the year 410 CE). [EDIT: >!^point ^of ^clarity. ^Let ^me ^acknowledge ^that ^while ^the ^Romans ^introduced ^the ^religion ^and ^indirectly ^influenced ^the ^cultural ^conversion, ^Saint ^Augustine ^of ^Cantebury ^is ^credited ^as ^the ^individual ^responsible ^for ^this ^introduction ^for ^most ^of ^the ^nation, ^though ^the ^conversion ^was ^mostly ^gradual ^and ^it ^didn't ^become ^the ^majority ^religion ^in ^England ^until ^the ^7th ^century!<] “But, wait!” I hear you say. “Weren’t the Romans famous for worshipping a pantheon of pagan gods?” Yes. They were. But Christianity moved from a minority religion to gradually become the majority religion in Rome after Emperor Constantine was officially converted in 312 CE. Do the math on that, and you’ll see that means there was about a century of overlap for the Romans to introduce the idea of Christianity to England before they pulled out and eventually fractured. Meanwhile, the Irish started practicing a different enough religion that it was given its own name: Irish Catholic, though detailing all the differences would create a sidebar-within-a-sidebar, so I think I'll get back on topic.

Got a little sidetracked in covering the history of Christianity in the British Isles (which is today referred to as ""Great Britian and Ireland"" by the Irish government) but we'll come back to that later. As to the question of why, specifically, the Catholic English of the late 13th century would have such issue with Brehon Law. There were a number of reasons.

* **Multiple Forms of Marriage:** In addition to monogamous marriage, Brehon Law recognized polygamous marriages. While rare, if a man (usually a wealthy man) had the resources to provide for multiple families (with their own separate homes) and did so equally, he was allowed to have as many wives as he wished. This was against catholic teachings.
* **Divorce:** Ironic as we may see it today, knowing that an English monarch would eventually dissolve the nation’s ties with the Catholic Church over the restriction against divorce, Brehon Law allowed for this in certain circumstances (such as in cases of infidelity or inability to provide support).
* **Matrilineal Inheritance:** Unlike the patrilineal inheritance of the catholic system, wealth under Brehon Law was passed down through the mother’s line, not the father’s.
* **Unions Outside of Marriage:** Unlike catholic beliefs about sex and marriage, Brehon Law legally recognized certain unions (including sexual relationships) that happened outside formal marriages. Some of these included ""baile” which would be similar to a modern “common law marriage” in which two people lived together despite not being formally married; ""laud"" which were essentially business partners, and; ""coibche"" which was a close (non-romantic, non-business) friendship which extended to the point of sharing inheritance, rights to property, and even debts of both parties. (Side note: there is some speculation as to whether any of these legally recognized relationships included homosexual unions, and while there isn’t direct proof of that, the Brehon Laws didn’t specifically forbade any unions from being same-sex either. Do with that information what you will. Certainly, I doubt there was anything to stop two same-sex coibches from being “coibches with benefits”… Just imagine the pearl-clutching when the English learned of this).

These specific examples of conflicting cultural values were in no small part of England’s motivation to eventually abolish Brehon Law, but beyond that they were simply “unchristian” for the simple fact that Brehon Law’s roots predated the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles (This is where we get back to that aside on religious introduction). Keep in mind that King Edward’s statement was made in 1277. This was a bit more than a century after the Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1169 and England’s occupation of Ireland at that point was slowly expanding. Personally, I don’t know if any of us can really ever know how much statements like these were really rooted in religious convictions or just the same type of politicization politicians engage in to this day where they use the values of a sympathetic group (which they only themselves see as a useful political prop) to justify a governmental action with ulterior motives. The cynic in me really wants to say he was just saying this to rile up his religious base to go over to Ireland and subjugate their people while feeling good about themselves (but I'll admit that’s purely unfalsifiable speculation).

AskHistorians,"Before insulin, did people with diabetes just die?","Short answer: They just died.

I should point out: by and large people are not born with type 1. It is something that develops most of the time in early childhood. It can also be something that develops in an adult, and it is a disease defined by the fact that the pancreas, for whatever reason, is not producing insulin. In most cases, this reason is autoimmune, but it does not necessarily need to be. The key feature of someone with type 1 is that they are insulin dependent.

What this functionally means is that T1D is defined by the fact that without access to insulin, you will die. Which makes the answer to your question rather inescapable. But that doesn't mean we can't talk about it!

Now,

The Greeks definitely described something that might have very well have been type 1 diabetes, but they were primarily focused on the frequency of urination. This is definitely a symptom of untreated diabetes, though there is also the chance that they are describing Diabetes Insipidus (which is due to issues with vasopressin signaling, rather than anything to do with the insulin/sugar system).

In China, it was definitely noted to be a disease with sweet urine back in the 7th century, based on the writings of Zhen Li-Yan, but I know a lot less about how it was managed in Asia.

That said, what the Greeks were writing about was almost certainly type 1 diabetes at least some of the time. Aretaeus the Cappadocian notes that:

> ""Diabetes is a wonderful affection not very frequent among men, being a melting down of the flesh and
limbs into urine. As with Hydrops, the cause is of a wet and cold nature. The kidneys and bladder, the usual
passageways of fluid, do not cease emitting urine, and the outpouring is profuse and without limit. It is just as though the aqueducts were opened wide. The development of this disease is gradual, but short will be the life of the man in whom the disease is fully developed. Emaciation proceeds quickly and death occurs rapidly. Moreover, life for the patient is tedious and full of pain. The desire for drink grows ever stronger, but no matter what quantity [of fluids] he drinks, satisfaction never occurs, and he passes more urine then he drinks. He cannot be stopped either from drinking or from urinating. For if he be restrained even for a short time from drinking, the mouth becomes parched, the body dry, and they feel as though all their viscera were being consumed by a raging fire. They despair of all and death occurs shortly amid a burning dryness, thirst as if caused by a burning fire. . . . And when the disease is at its height they urinate constantly. From this fact, the disease has derived its name, 'diabetes,' meaning 'siphon,' for fluids do not remain in the body, but use the body only as a channel through which they may flow out. . . . The evil of the affliction is that thirst and drink increase one another. ... ""

[Translation obtained from ""Aretaeus, the Cappadocian History Enlightens the Present,"" an article by John Reed](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/3/5/419/6579/Aretaeus-the-Cappadocian-History-Enlightens-the) just click the ""PDF"" button.

That is certainly a pretty good fit for a description of type 1 diabetes (through the lens of an ancient Greek Physician).

Prior to the insulin era, management almost always focused on manipulating diet and trying various ancient drugs. Aretaeus (the guy from the quote above) suggested milk and carbohydrates, as well as hiera (which I think was in reference to hiera picra, a purgative, though there were a couple of other things it could be), nardum (I assume Spikenard oil), mastix (mastic resin), and theriak (which is one stop short of just writing down ""use a panacea"" and being done with it). [From Allen's 1919 Monograph TOTAL DIETARY REGULATION IN THE TREATMENT
OF DIABETES](https://digitalcommons.rockefeller.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context=monographs-rockefeller-institute). (The monograph in particular is interesting, given that it came out just before insulin became an option.)

This, as you might expect, did absolutely nothing to actually combat the disease.

That monograph has some truly wonderful things in it, by the way, like how John Rollo in 1796 suggested: ""Breakfast, 1½ pints of milk and½ pint of lime-water, mtxed together; and bread and butter. For noon, plain blood puddings, made of blood and suet only. Dinner, game, or old meats, which have been long kept; and as far as the stomach may bear, fat and rancid old meats, as pork. To eat in moderation. Supper, the same as breakfast"" and, ""The skin was to be greased daily with hog's lard, flannel worn next the skin, and an ulceration about the size of half a crown to be maintained opposite each kidney.""

This guy recovered, so we can assume it was type 2 diabetes. After all, if it was lifestyle driven, you certainly won't be eating much if your primary dietary options are apparently *rancid meat.*

And that was how things were. Treatments, when they became effective, were almost always an attempt designed around type two diabetics, when they did come up. That is if they were helpful at all and not outright dangerous.

Type 1 diabetes, however: still a death sentence. 

The article [The Rise of Childhood Type 1 Diabetes in the 20th Century](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/51/12/3353/34264/The-Rise-of-Childhood-Type-1-Diabetes-in-the-20th), by Edwin A.M. Gale, makes it clear: there was near uniform fatality in childhood onset cases in the pre-insulin era. Once they had a handle on diet, it seemed that the life expectancy in the pre-insulin era increased, from mere weeks to months to possibly even as much as 3-6 years for ""mild cases,"" but the end result was fatal in almost all cases. The exception seemed to be those who had a family history of diabetes corresponding to what we would now probably categorize as type 2 (essentially, childhood onset type 2 diabetes, rather than type 1).

Further Reading: [Diabetes Research and Care Through The Ages](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/40/10/1302/29439/Diabetes-Research-and-Care-Through-the-Ages) by Zinman et. al is a more thorough treatment than I have posted here."
AskHistorians,How dig Genghis Khan and his Mongolian contemporaries get fibre in their diet?,"Ooooh this is a fun one. The Mongol diet has been a subject of interest for historians and scholars, given the vast expanse of the empire and its influence on world history. Primarily a pastoralist and nomadic society, the Mongols relied on livestock for their sustenance, with meat and dairy products forming the basis of their diet (Weatherford, 2004). Since fiber is essential for a healthy digestive system, the Mongols had to go to great lengths in order to ensure that they were able to stay as nutritionally healthy as possible in order to conquer new territory.

One of the primary sources of fiber for the Mongols came from wild vegetables, roots, and tubers. While not central to their diet, these food items were consumed when available, providing a slightly modest amount of fiber (Morgan, 2007). Since the Mongols were not particularly focused in agricultural foods, they did not have much access to such nutrition that would be possible to consume if they did. However, they did consume some grains such as millet and barley, which provided additional fiber, when conquering new peoples who were particularly gifted in agriculture (Grousset, 1970). Additionally, fruits like berries, apples, and other wild fruits were occasionally consumed, contributing some fiber to their diet (Weatherford, 2004).

The expansion of the Mongol Empire played a significant role in introducing the Mongols to new sources of fiber. As they conquered various regions with agricultural populations, they gained increased access to plant-based foods such as grains, legumes, and vegetables (McLynn, 2015). Furthermore, trade with distant lands facilitated the exchange of food items and increased the diversity of their diet, including the introduction of fiber-rich foods (Morgan, 2007).

Despite these sources, it is important to note that the fiber intake of Genghis Khan and the Mongols would have been significantly lower than what is recommended by modern nutrition guidelines (Weatherford, 2004). However, their lifestyle, characterized by high levels of physical activity due to their nomadic and military culture, could have partially compensated for the lack of fiber in their diet (Grousset, 1970).

In conclusion, the diet of Genghis Khan and the Mongols was primarily focused on meat and dairy, with extremely limited sources of fiber. While they consumed wild vegetables, fruits, and grains, their intake of fiber was significantly lower than modern recommendations, which could have led to the cultural significance of warrior-centric diarrhea as you had mentioned. The expansion of the Mongol Empire and trade with other cultures introduced them to new sources of fiber, but their overall consumption remained relatively low. Their active lifestyle may have helped to mitigate the effects of low fiber intake, but it is still important to recognize the distinct differences between their diet and contemporary nutritional guidelines.

AskHistorians,I once heard a Jewish Studies professor say the Nazis won the narrative about the Holocaust and how we talk about Jewish people. Was he right?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"Blacksmiths, farmers, stonemasons… hard labor in the premodern times was brutal. How would a peasant laborer in… say France, 100 years war period deal with a repetitive trauma/orthopedic injury like a rotator cuff tear, slipped disk, carpal tunnel or torn meniscus? We’re they screwed?","I'm not going to be able to answer the question specifically about a laborer in France in the 100 Years War, but I can answer based on human pathophysiology, human evolution, and the management of orthopedic injuries in the modern context. Lets dive in...

First, while acutely painful during the days/weeks following initial injury, a rotator cuff tear, lumbar disc herniation, or ACL rupture is not a life sentence for pain and suffering. Our body can make amazing compensations for biomechanical deficits, from building new muscle to learning new motor pathways to avoid weakness/pain. Modern professional athletes play without intact ACLs, the body can reabsorb the disc herniation, and even as relatively immobile modern humans we routinely tear, or partially tear, one of the four rotator cuff muscles. I once attended a talk by an orthopedic surgeon who said your age in years is roughly the chance you are walking around with a rotator cuff tear. We just don't know until we happen into an MRI and snap a picture. That said, there are always going to be people who can't compensate/cope with their injury, or a disc herniation impinging on a vital nerve requiring surgical intervention, but the majority of modern people heal enough to function if given time to progress out of the initial inflammatory stage.

This brings me to my second point, despite the modern Western medical focus on pain as the fifth vital sign, and an extensive pharmacopeia of pain moderating substances to avoid that uncomfortable sensation at all costs, pain and injury is a very normal part of being human. Our ancestors lived very rough and tumble lives, with bony evidence of osteoarthitic changes to major joints, healed fractures, and active infections that were with that individual until time of death even before the emergence of modern humans. Neanderthal remains from Shanidar Cave (Shanidar 1) show evidence of extensive orthopedic injuries that would have immobilized this older adult male, but he was cared for while he healed, nursed back to health, and lived many more years. There also different cultural interpretations of pain/illness. From personal experience living in modern small scale semi-foraging communities in the Amazon, pain isn't discussed as much as in the U.S. Life is absolutely hard there. You are always being eaten by some blood thirsty insect, everyone has low grade skin infections from bathing in the river, clearing land/harvest food/hunting is accompanied by cuts, bruises, and the wear and tear of carrying heavy loads, but that's just normal, everyday expectations. They absolutely take people into town for medical after large acute injuries, but most healthcare is small scale and local.

This brings us to a third point, we are a highly social species who care for our injured, we can create a surplus of food sufficient to cover the temporary loss of an individual, and with a brain capable of remembering hundreds, if not thousands, of medicinal substances/approaches. Unfortunately, I don't know the specifics of folk medicine in France during the 100 Years War, but I've personally seen skeletal remains from large scale agriculturalists in the Americas with impeccable fracture healing, leaving me to guess the limb was immobilized/splinted for some time to allow for bone healing. Again, sorry I can't answer the specifics about France, hopefully someone else can fill you in on that specific topic.

So, was this poor farmer with a rotator cuff tear (or some other orthopedic injury) screwed? If they could survive the initial disability during the inflammatory period, most likely relying on extensive social networks for food, and the accumulated knowledge of local healers for symptom management, they could return to work. They might need to modify how they worked (increase use their non dominant arm, invent tool modifications, adapt to a smaller range of motion, etc) but we can compensate for serious injuries if given time and care. There will always be unfortunate injuries that disable an entire limb, and we see evidence of limb atrophy in skeletal assemblages, but because these individuals lived long enough to show extensive bone modifications we know pre-modern humans can survive substantial injuries if given care through our social networks."

AskHistorians,Jewish minorities have lived in China and India for thousands of years. Historically did they face any anti-Semitism like the Jewish people living in Europe did?,"In the context of India, the question of “which Jews?” arises as there were several distinct communities which reached different parts of India at different periods of time and therefore had widely different historical trajectories. Consider for example, the case of the Bene Israel community of the Konkan Coast, Maharashtra and Mumbai – their origins are obscure. The traditions of the Bene Israel hold that they were descendants of Jews who were fleeing the invasion of Antiochus Epiphanes in 175 BCE. The refugees were unfortunately shipwrecked near the village of Navgaon on the Konkan Coast and only seven couples survived the ordeal. Other theories of this community’s origins trace the Bene Israel back to Yemen, Persia or Babylon and rather than 175 BCE, their arrival might have been on the 5th or 6th century CE or after the destruction of the second Temple in 70 CE. Rather than one catastrophic shipwreck, this community may have been bolstered by multiple waves of immigration. Given all these dates and countries of origins, the broad point is the actual origins are shrouded in myth and any concrete literary sources before the arrival of the Europeans to India in the late 15th century is fragmentary at best.

What is known is that the Bene Israel community was isolated from other Jewish populations elsewhere and so assimilated into broader Maharashtrian society – there is a reference in a letter by the Jewish theologian and physician Moses Maimonides (dated either 1199 or 1200) which refers to a Jewish community in India which knew nothing of the Torah and only practiced circumcision and observed the Sabbath. A Danish missionary, J.A. Sartorius writing in 1763 echoed Maimonides’ sentiments by mentioning that the Bene Israel did not know Hebrew and they only remembered the Shema. Several other Christian missionaries mentioned that the Bene Israel lacked the Torah and knew little of Jewish history. Indeed, in terms of appearance, dress and language the Bene Israel were identical to their neighbors. They Indianized their names – Samuel became Samaji, Ezekiel became Hassaji and their families came to resemble that of their neighbors with the married and unmarried sons remaining under the roof of their fathers. Despite this, they still retained some aspects of their Jewish identity such as the observance of the Sabbath, circumcision , the celebration of major festivals and observance of Jewish dietary restrictions. The Bene Israel integrated themselves into the rural Maharashtrian economy as oil pressers; they were called Shanwar Teli (Saturday Oilmen) due to their profession and their peculiar habit of not working on Saturdays and thus they became another endogamous caste group (jati) that existed in Maharashtrian society. 

The Bene Israel were rediscovered and slowly reintegrated back into the Jewish fold thanks to a traveler named David Rahabi, a Jew from Cochin. Rahabi had his suspicions regarding the identity of the Shanwar Teli thanks some of their peculiar customs but he attempted to confirm his suspicions of their potential Jewish identity by presenting several Bene Israel women with fish and when they removed the fins and scales in accordance with Jewish dietary customs, he became convinced of their Jewish identity. Rahabi then instructed members of several select families of Hebrew and other Jewish practices for several years thereby starting the process of integrating the Bene Israel community back into mainstream Judaism. Once again, there is a wide variation in dates when this rediscovery occurred; Bene Israel tradition holds that this occurred in the 11th century while a more credible date is the mid-eighteenth century as there is a letter from an Ezekiel Rahabi, a prominent Cochin Jewish merchant discussing the role that the Cochin Jews were playing in educating their brethren in Maharashtra and indeed Ezekiel Rahabi did have a son named David. With the rise of Mumbai (then Bombay) as a prominent port city in the 18th century, the Bene Israel/Shanwar Teli left their villages and immigrated to Mumbai and other cities. They took up jobs as skilled artisans in fields such as carpentry and masonry and enlisted as sepoys in the East India Company’s armies. The latter profession was not so strange as the Bene Israel also had a history of military service in the armies of India’s indigenous rulers as well. Thus we see that the Bene Israel had no restrictions on what occupation they could undertake unlike European Jews nor was there a restriction of their movements. Indeed, thanks to the influence of Cochin Jews and American and British missionaries such as Dr. John Wilson, the Bene Israel increasingly pursued education (learning both English and Marathi) and thus experienced upward social mobility as they joined the British governmental service or private trading firms such as that of recently arrived Baghdadi Jew David Sassoon. 

The point of all of this is that the Bene Israel community had been isolated from the broader Jewish population and had lost a lot of its Jewish identity. It was only relatively late (i.e. the mid eighteenth century and onwards) that the Bene Israel were reintegrated into the mainstream. Besides several cultural practices, the Bene Israel had comfortably fit themselves into Maharashtrian society as another caste group until their rediscovery at the hands of the Cochin Jews. The question then arises, could a Jewish community which had forgotten most of its Jewish history and practices (to the point that their fellow Jews had difficulty recognizing them as Jews) experience antisemitism? Regardless, the Bene Israel did not face any systematic difficulties in emigrating to the cities, nor was there an issue in acquiring a wide range of skilled occupations both as artisans and white collar workers in British ruled Bombay. When Richard Cashman was researching the Bene Israel in 1969, one of his informants replied to his question of how the Bene Israel survived as a distinct, if isolated, community with the following answer: 

> “In Palestine, idol worship was taboo and discouraged Jews from consorting with others who worshiped idols. This was the most important reason why we couldn’t associate with Hindus…Also, in India the Jews were allowed to own land and were very good artisans, so they could maintain themselves as a self-sufficient culture. In addition there was no intolerance in India; the Hindus were not a proselytizing religion until the Arya Samaj”

Several scholars of India’s Jews such as Nathan Katz and Joan G. Roland have echoed the sentiment of Cashman’s informant above that the Jews of India were not exposed to an indigenous form of intolerance or antisemitism. It is always difficult to prove the absence of something and given how fragmentary the evidence is (as seen in the history of Bene Israel above), perhaps these scholars are making too strong of a case in light of the existing evidence. Perhaps by briefly examining the history of the Jews of the Malabar Coast, we may see the experience of another Jewish community in India and its experiences. This may be bolster or hinder the idea of a religiously tolerant India."
AskHistorians,Did prehistoric humans really live primarily in caves or is that just where remains are preserved due to it being a protected environment?,"The short answer is no, early humans and other extinct hominoid species did not spend most of their lives in caves or rockshelters. Most archaeology sites are found in open-air settings (near important resources). These sites often lack good organic preservation and do not get the same amount of attention as cave sites that can contain very diverse and unique assemblages. The heavy focus on these extraordinary cave collections is likely responsible for creating the misconception that early people primarily lived in caves. 

My dissertation work focused on the settlement-subsistence strategies of Paleoindian/Paleolithic groups in the Intermountain West region of the U.S. One of the issues we face in this region, is that much of what we know about Paleoindian subsistence and perishable technology comes from cave and rock shelter sites. While the dry setting of these sites create a perfect environment to preserve organic material, research suggests that these cave occupations were primarily short-term occupations that focused on a variety of specialized tasks (e.g., caching, resource processing, hunting camps) and that they only offer a small snapshot of what life was really like for these groups. There is little evidence to support the use of caves and rockshelters as long term residential camps in this region. Instead, we find the vast majority of pre-contact sites in open-air settings. However, because open-air sites in desert regions are often exposed at the surface, most of these sites consist solely of stone tools. Cave and rockshelter sites on the other hand can contain wood, bone, textile, and other perishable artifacts that are very “sexy” to both archaeologists and the general public because of their research potential and rarity. Given that these sites are so rare, they often generate the most academic attention and, in turn, are the most likely candidates to be shared with the general public. This can lead to a misperception by the general public that early people primarily lived in caves. While this is not the only reason for this misconception, it may be one of the primary drivers.

Ultimately, caves and rockshelters are great places to get out of the elements and to store food/gear (among other things) but most humans like to live close to food, water, and other essential resources that are often found far from caves."
AskHistorians,"In the Bible, Moses marries a Nubian (black) woman named Zipporah. Why then did so many Christian nations ban interracial marriage for a long time?","The Nubian wife of Moses is found in the book of Numbers, chapter 12. Identifying her with Zipporah was the work of early modern theologians who wanted to ensure that Moses was not seen as a polygamist; however, the difference in skin color was not denied by early modern Europeans, and we can see the Nubian wife portrayed in European art, for example, [this excellent 1650 painting by Jacob Jordaens](https://artway.eu/content.php?id=1573&lang=en&action=show).

Around the same time, the Jesuit Alonso de Sandoval reached the conclusion that Numbers 12 proved that the Church is able to make blackness into beauty: Zipporah was “black as a daughter of Jethro and beautiful as the spouse of Moses. Even so the Church, as daughter of Adam, is black in the body of its children; but as bride of Christ, who is its head, is most beautiful, without spot or wrinkle.” (translation by Elizabeth McGrath) This interpretation does not consider whether modern-day people should marry Nubians; it is rather a fairly mealy-mouthed statement about ""blackness,"" here implying sin, and playing both sides of European racial biases.

As Catholic readings of the Bible as allegory gave way to Protestant utopianism in America, we no longer see so many metaphorical interpretations of the Nubian wife. Instead, just as so many Biblical figures became questionable models of morality for Americans, so too did Moses become an uncomfortable example. Some readers of Black history may remember the antebellum school in Connecticut that educated Black girls and became targeted for arson, persecution, and arrest. The owner of this school was Prudence Crandall, who was completely unconcerned by the specter of interracial marriage. When accused of promoting race mixing, Crandall responded curtly that “Moses had a black wife.”

This became a scandalous catchphrase, used to spread fear in the community about Crandall’s intentions. Her opponent, a Democratic Party politician, wrote that “when she justified her proceedings and principles on the ground that Moses married a ‘colored woman,’ it was suggested that she might as well advocate polygamy now, because it was lawful in the days of antiquity.” This is regardless of the fact that *Numbers 12 actually has God intervene on Moses' side*, over the objections of his family who say it is inappropriate for him to marry a Nubian.

This sort of infuriated response was fairly standard over the next century, both before and after the Civil War. “Moses married a colored woman” was not a phrase that inspired a logical rebuttal, but was simply repeated by proponents of segregation as an example of the opposing side’s evil intent, in the same way that partisan catchphrases get repeated with disbelief on Twitter today. When an Indianapolis lawyer defending an interracial couple against “miscegenation” charges quoted the phrase, the judge replied, “well, Moses did a lot of things which if he did around here today might compel me to take charge of him.”  The lawyer again pointed out that God supported Moses, but that was apparently irrelevant here too.

Following the Civil War, more measured theological relations of Moses to blackness began to emerge, especially by Black Americans. The historian Katherine Low considers defenses of the Nubian wife to have become mainstream not through preaching, but through 1950s popular adaptions of the Old Testament, epitomized by the 1956 Charlton Heston film “The Ten Commandments.” Discomfort over America's racial caste system after World War II was overcome by transporting the reader back to Biblical times, where Moses' marriage could be carefully alluded to with the good taste of fiction and the safety of remote distance in place and time.

AskHistorians,Why were Chinese walls built so differently to European walls? What caused this divergence in wall construction?,"Part of the reason is that Chinese city walls often had secondary uses that the Europeans didn’t have that made large earthworks more viable than other types of walls.   
  
Arguably the most important secondary function for city walls was their function as levees and dikes to counter flooding, which were a frequent and dangerous occurrence among the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. This function is most evident in cities with incomplete walls near these rivers, such as Chungmou, where often the only part of the city wall completed were the ones facing the river. Levees need to be several meters thick and relatively tall to hold back large amounts of water during a flood, which likely contributed to the use of thicker earthworks as city walls. As far as I can tell, few Roman or Medieval fortifications, if any, also functioned as flood defense, while flood defense was a key priority for many city walls along the major Chinese rivers.  
  
Another aspect was the employment of wide moats. Nanjing and Suzhou had 80-meter wide moats, and Beijing and Taiyuan had 30 meter wide moats. These excavations generated a lot of earth, which could be used to simultaneously build the city walls. While the use of excavated earth to build fortifications was also known to Europe (for instance, motte-and-bailey constructions and ringworks), contemporary defense reasons and prestige reasons resulted in wood and earth castles being replaced with stone castles.  
  
There was also the cost. City walls were one of the first things to be constructed in a new Chinese  settlement, and they often enclosed a vast area of space to contain artificial bodies of water, agricultural land, and salt lakes alongside housing. As a result, these walls had to cover an area larger than European city walls for the same population. Then as cities grew larger than their walls, satellite walled cities or an outer wall also had to be built to contain the growing population. That lent itself more to earthworks, which were easier to build and gather materials for (especially with the simultaneous construction of a moat or canals).

AskHistorians,How in shape were most knights generally; and what was their “workout” like?,"You might get some newer answers, but in the mean time you might like to read [my old answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ceo5lm/what_would_the_physique_of_a_medieval_knight_have/eu4kdjy/) to a similar question.

The answer, in short, is that muscularity tends to be emphasized in art by the 16th century, but before that, different aspects of the body were the focus. Particularly, 15th century knights were often shown with very small waists and were generally quite thin. However, we should be aware that illustrations were not photographs, and art has connections to other art as much as it has a connection to reality, and so the depiction of knights as thin to the point of emaciation is likely a reflection of artistic shorthand - connecting knights to Christ's suffering, for instance, and emphasizing a virtue in simplicity and asceticism, even if that wasn't really a major thing for the knights in question - rather than a depiction of any particular knight's actual body.

All that said, knights were the product of a medieval training culture that valued fitness and dynamic athleticism, and young men were encouraged from an early age to dance, wrestle, fence, swim, ride, and climb, and to combine several of those skills in tourneys and hunting. My answer linked above also talks about this training culture, but I also go into more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qxixb9/im_a_young_italian_noble_in_the_late_14th_century/hlb61q9/) 

So, in short, the answer is likely *quite fit*, though that might not mean rippling muscles and visible abs like it tends to today. I'm happy to address any followup questions."

Did the Medieval period actually have dedicated weapon stores, where anyone with the money could walk in and buy a sword and a bundle of arrows, or were weapons only ever made on commission?","Sort of. Not in the sense of a general weapons store, but in many European cities at least by the later middle ages (1300 or so up through wherever you draw the line for the start of the early modern period), most European cities would have had craftworker guilds which would produce, collectively, nearly any kind of arms and armors that the culture could produce. Guilds were an organization of *trades*, in which all of the members of a city who worked in a particular trade worked together, in some respects, and individually in others. One armorsmith, someone like [Lorenz Helmschmied (the surname literally means ""helmet maker"") of Augsburg](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/838864) might work mostly on commissions from extremely wealthy patrons, and produce some of the finest armors in Europe, while someone else in the same guild might hammer away at simpler armors intended for sale to the urban militia and to mercenaries. Both might run a store or storefront, at which anyone with the cash for a purchase could shop.

So ultimately while you could wander a European city and likely find everything a fantasy adventurer might need, rather than going to ""the weapons shop"" you'd likely have to go first to the [cutler's shop, illustrated here by Jost Amman](https://www.sciencesource.com/pix/244/2449827-cutler-and-customer-testing-sword-1568.jpg), where the cutler could fit a style of blade you like to a hilt you like - they could also re-mount your blade, repair any fittings, sharpen the blade, and clean off the rust - but you might have to go to a joiner's or leatherworkers shop for a bespoke scabbard. Then you could go visit the gunsmiths or bowsmiths. If we head from Augsburg to nearby Nuremberg we might also be able to run to the shop of the gunsmith August Kotter, who is thought by some to be the very first gunsmith to rifle his barrels, sometime between 1500 and 1520. Or you could go to Vienna, where Gaspard Kollner had been doing it - according to some - since 1498. But these were gun towns, and proud of their production of artillery and firearms. In Genoa it might be more common to find crossbow makers, or elsewhere to find odd little shops where cabinet-makers stick gun barrels onto handplaned stocks, or where joiners leave off their work on window fittings and door frames and instead fit locks onto stocks and send that along to another shop to have the barrel fitted. At most of these shops you could also make special custom orders, because the entire production system of Europe at this time was still dependent on skilled hands working skilled trades.

Of course, if you're not interested in bespoke armor or customized weapons, you could try a peddler's stall. You might be able to buy or borrow armor or weapons from a reluctant city guardsman. During yearly (or more than yearly, or less than yearly) market fairs, tradesmen of every stripe could travel in to a large city like Augsburg or Nuremberg to sell their wares, and you could wander up and down tented lanes and find rural craftworkers producing simpler weapons, or taking in items to be resold or repaired.

So, all in all, yes and no. No devoted ""weapons shop"" to speak of, really, unless you could find secondhand sales by peddlers, but you could likely find anything you'd need in most European cities of any decent size. Our scope expands even further if we consider the buying possibilities of large fairs."
AskHistorians,"Nowadays we have the concept of ""vegging out"" (relaxing while doing very little), but it's usually associated with TV/video games/mass media. Did similar forms of relaxation exist before the 20th century and mass media? If so, what did people do to ""veg out""?","There were plenty of amusements in prior centuries,
but let's talk about a portable one which can
be used for ""vegging out""-like behavior, and is
attested to by quite a few period paintings; the
cup and ball, or bilboquet.

You've likely seen one -- it simply has a stick
with a cup, a small ball or marble, and a string, and you need to
get the ball into the cup. It is normally thought
of as a child's toy (maybe one given in cheap plastic)
but it used to be everywhere; [this print](https://imgur.com/a/ATwMjmY) from
the 1992 book _Puzzles Old and New_ claims 16th century
provenance (although it appears from the clothing to 
be actually 18th). The word does show up in the 1500s 
so that is perhaps the reason for the confusion but
we have more definitive evidence of play from the
18th century onward in Europe; 
we can point to plenty of pictures of enough

in [the midst of play](https://www.plentyofpaintings.com/Jules-Garnier/Joueur-De-Bilboquet-oil-painting.html)
to say it was [very widespread](https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/The-bilboquet-players/03BD8237024FE6ECC430BE09F1923836).
(That last painting was by Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne
who lived from 1769 to 1834.)

The more ""sophisticated"" play with the devices resembled
that of fancy yo-yo tricks -- [this figure](https://imgur.com/a/0iXqRDY) from a [1937
paper](https://www.persee.fr/doc/jsa_0037-9174_1938_num_30_2_1978) gives a pretty good example.

Of course, such idle enthusiasm would not go without
condemnation. In the 1700s the authors
Diderot and d'Alembert gave stern moral warnings
about the immorality of bilboquets; by being
a frivolous activity of no purpose (not
even gaining money, like gambling), there 
is nothing but success in something
that is intrinsically useless. The bibloquet
came to represent a sort of general
idleness of the gentry.

A 1713 comedic description notes that

>The Bilboquet's repute is such that
nothing can increase it: the shops of
the most famous perfumers have nothing
comparable to the smell of your fame;
although raised in a forest, you entertain
the greatest city in the world; a look
at your wasit, and we are all charmed by your
figure; and even the blind would admit
that you are nicely turned out.

There are bilboquets attested from other
cultures (notably the Inuit, using bone)
so this is not purely a European invention,
although it is unclear where the
device was made independently and where
it was the result of passing in the process
of foreign trade.

AskHistorians,Why was the U.S. government in WWII careful to not bomb historically significant areas in Japan (such as Kyoto) but did not exercise the same caution when bombing targets in Europe?,"Kyoto was very, very much an exceptional case, the result of a single, very-highly-placed official (Secretary of War Henry Stimson) working tirelessly, against stiff resistance from the military, to preserve this one city, to the point of enlisting the authority of Truman himself towards this end. [I have written at some length about this in a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wk7qll/how_would_a_young_american_man_travel_to_japan/ijoay1g/). Kyoto should absolutely not be taken as some kind of ""norm"": the effort to preserve it was highly exceptional and was understood as such at the time by those involved. 

Separate from that, the US did take some efforts to avoid destroying some cultural heritage sites in Europe. This is the famous Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (fictionalized in the 2014 film _Monuments Men_), which sought to protect European treasures of art from war damage and recover art pillaged by the Nazis. This work was always on a much smaller scale, though, than the non-bombing of an entire city like Kyoto, but it did influence bombing and invasion plans.

EDITED to add, because people keep suggesting it, adding it, etc. — as the link above describes in detail, [there is really **no evidence that Stimson went to Kyoto on his honeymoon**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wk7qll/how_would_a_young_american_man_travel_to_japan/ijoay1g/).

AskHistorians,"Today, talking in a movie theater is rude. During the showing of silent films, were spaces that showed film “noisy”? Did people discuss the films, talk leisurely, etc. while the showing was ongoing?",">My idea of the proper way to enjoy a movie is incorporated in college movie houses. You can hiss the villain, jeer the hero, go to sleep, put your feet in the aisles and have a hell of a good time.

>-- from _The Judge_ magazine, 1929

As the quote above implies, it depends on where you went.

Once movies got past their ""working class"" period (1900s, early 1910s, where films were generally shown by traveling showmen) there were certainly attempts at a very high end experience.

The Capitol Theater in New York opened in 1918; a 1919 showing of
_His Majesty, The American_ ([video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A8zu8uyTiw)) included
a seventy-piece orchestra with an eleven-act revue as staged by
Ned Wayburn (of Ziegfeld) with Mae West as a soloist and newly-composed music
by George Gershwin. (One of the new pieces was _Swanee_, which [went on to be rather famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGygMw0-OQ).)

Other houses attempted ""prologues"" with varying degrees of grandeur dependent
on finances; at a smaller house in the Midwest, one person who saw the 1923 film _Scaramouche_ 
(a swashbuckler set in the 1700s; [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS8PyjAZSDU))
described a prologue with people who were dressed supposedly representing ""Elizabethan
England"" except ""there was one young lady dressed as Cleopatra
and a man who appeared to represent General Robert E. Lee"". Another film he
saw had ""recruits from the local high school"" dance ballet.

The thing extremely common across all levels was music. With a 70 piece orchestra you could expect a rapt audience; with a trio or even solo piano performer ... it depends.

>The instrument is generally old, out of tune, strings dusty, and incapable of producing
the correct vibrations.

Descriptions of a performance include children in the front row kicking and boys whistling
along with the melodies.

>If he began to coast after six or seven hours of playing, he would hear loud cries of ""Music!""
or (if it were a college town) ""Better Music!""

The ""six or seven hours"" implies something else common: the movie (and associated activities) would show on a loop. The Eastman in Rochester had a standard bill to fill 2 hours:

- 8 minute overture
- ten minute news weekly
- ten minute live act
- ten minute comedy film
- 80 minute or less feature film

The idea was that people could walk in at any time, and they would stay for the next part of the ""loop"" to catch the opening material that they missed. Films were expected to be able to be started in the middle, and Eric Clarke, who managed the Eastman, screened films for possible selection by starting in the middle, to make sure it was the kind of movie that could be understood when started halfway. (He claimed half of his patrons attended films this way.)

Talking could also vary based on the segment in that two-hour loop; a serious movie might have a generally quiet audience, but the comedy might be treated like a straight vaudeville segment with audience interaction (as [I've written about before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/n154qa/from_a_modern_perspective_the_humor_in_looney/gwdlo8t/), early cartoons did fourth-wall breaking with the expectation that the audience was going to be noisy).

Intentional audience sing-alongs were possible; the peak seemed to be roughly 1918, where in Chicago a newspaper noted roughly half of the 200 showings included some sort of community singing segment. A 1920 article estimated roughly 12 million people had taken part in sing-alongs. There was an ""Animated Song"" film series which intentionally catered to this market.

One other type of film trend -- not necessarily common, but definitely present in some immigrant neighborhoods -- was a presenter. This was a live person who would make commentary as a film went on.

>From behind, the man -- he steps up to the lady and grabs her pocketbook. “Ganef! Robber! Help! Ganef!”

This was essentially an interpretive narrator; sometimes they would speak in the language of the neighborhood, which could bring friction for attendees who were not fluent.

So in summary: you could certainly find the modern ""quiet"" set, except that instead of there just being a main show there were usually at least some shorts and often live entertainment; if you wanted ""noisy"" you could go to a more working-class or college-town showing, where jeers and heckling were much more acceptable.

To refer back to _The Judge_ article I started with:

>It is fun to go to movies in these places, and if I could see openings in their mouldy but amiable smoking balconies I'd never step inside Times Square. Our real aristocracy carries a union-card and an easy horse-laugh.

AskHistorians,"If southerners before the US Civil War felt that slaves were were ""inferior"" and not ""the same species"" why were so many slave owning mothers willing to let their slaves nurse/breastfeed their children?","Great question that incorporates a bunch of different aspects of history. I've written about this topic in response to a few past questions and will be borrowing a bit here and there from those answers. But, before getting into the specifics of your question, I think it's helpful to pull way back and consider the system that was chattel slavery in the American South. It was brutal, dehumanizing system that destroyed families, denied millions of people their right to full autonomy, and was financially lucrative. 

Importing people from Africa or the Caribbean for the purpose of enslavement in the United States ended when the ""Act Prohibiting the Importation of Slaves"" went into effect in 1808. Prior to that though, beginning in the late 1600s, English colonies established the concept of *partus sequitur ventrem* or ""that which is born follows the womb"" which meant that every child born to an enslaved woman or girl was legally born into slavery - regardless of the child's father's legal status. In a [study of slave birth rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7716878/) between 1619 and The Civil War, historical demographer J. David Hacker wrote, ""all researchers have agreed that slave birth rates in the nineteenth century were very high, near a biological maximum for a human population."" In other words, enslavers found a way to get new people to enslave after it became illegal. Babies. 

Many, many babies. More than three million babies.

There are two things that are helpful to contextualize around those babies, and the white babies born to enslavers. First, prior to the modern invention of modern baby formula, substitutes for breastmilk could sustain a baby but were woefully inadequate. Even cow's or goat's milk before major advancements in the late 1800s - because, and just to state it explicitly, babies are small humans, not small cows or goats. Babies who, for whatever reason, were not breastfeed were often described as weak and sickly and whenever possible, the adults would seek out a lactating woman or girl who could feed the child. A second thing is that communal breastfeeding and the act of one woman or girl who'd recently given birth breastfeeding a baby born to another woman or girl, also known as a *wet nurse,* wasn't unusual. There were nuances among different groups of women and girls and we'll get that into that in a bit but it's helpful to understand that sensation you have that about another recently pregnant women breastfeeding your baby is tied up with our modern norms around privacy, the nuclear family, and more. In effect, it's about one's conceptualization of what it means to *mother* a child. To quote Janet Golden from her book, *A social history of wet nursing in America: From breast to bottle*: 

> Mothering is an activity gendered by a culture just as it is defined by political, legal, economic, social, intellectual, emotional, and medical paradigms. Its definition is neither fixed by biology nor universally applied; instead it changes over time and varies according to social class, race, age, and marital status.

Which is to say, as you think about one woman or girl feeding another woman or girl's baby in the context you asked about, we can think about it as problem (hungry baby) --> solution (lactating woman or girl.) The nature of the relationship between the adults (or lactating girl) around the baby, though, was complex and contextual. 

Rather than starting with the lactating enslaved women and girls who breastfed white babies, I want to flip the scenario, as it were, to demonstrate the problem --> solution dynamic. Since chattel slavery was so financial lucrative, enslavers--white women and white men--could be very pragmatic about solving problems related to the management and control of enslaved people. Worried that if they can read, they'll organize and escape or try to harm you? Make literacy illegal. Need to pass on wealth so your daughter can start her new marriage on a strong financial footing? Gift her several enslaved people--and any children they might have in the future--as a wedding gift. Want to ensure that your children grow up knowing how to be an enslaver? Model for them how to disrespect and denigrate all Black people they may encounter so they know their place in the world. For an upcoming episode of the [AskHistorians podcast,](https://www.askhistorians.com/podcast) I spoke to J. C. Hallman, the author of *[Say Anarcha: A Young Woman, a Devious Surgeon, and the Harrowing Birth of Modern Women’s Health](https://anarchaarchive.com/)* and we talked about the lengths enslavers would go to ensure the enslaved women and girls they owned could continue to give birth, including one enslaver who ""volunteered"" women he owned to be subjected to painful surgeries a local doctor was working on perfecting. 

This pragmatism and focus on the financial benefits of enslaved babies is how it came to be that white women who'd recently given birth might nurse an enslaved baby. To be sure, and again this gets into dynamics around class and how a married couple that owned slaves saw the woman's role as a mother, not all women did. But, if a farm or planation was depending on that baby making it safely into childhood and adulthood for their finances, it made pragmatic sense for the white woman to breastfeed the baby if she were lactating and the baby's mother could not. This also helps us understand that enslavers knew that the people they enslaved were the same species - that they were not inferior. 

So now, let's look at white babies and Black women and girls. Breastfeeding can act as a form of birth control - for many recently pregnant people, the act of breastfeeding inhibits the menstrual cycle, making conception difficult. Many women who were enslavers wanted to breastfeed their own children because they wanted to space out births or otherwise delay a future pregnancy. Or, as was more common, they saw breastfeeding as a major part of their responsibility as a mother and would not entertain the idea of a wet nurse, free or enslaved. Others though, like the wife of Truth's enslaver, did not want to breastfeed for a multitude of reasons. Some saw it as messy business, unbecoming of a true woman, while others wanted to get pregnant again as quickly as possible. In the case of Truth, it's also possible that the enslaver's wife felt that Sojourner's breastmilk could help fortify her children and protect them from diseases and so, tasked other enslaved women or girls to care for Truth's babies and feed her own. It's important to note that enslaved babies did die due to neglect or malnutrition - but again, babies become children and adults who could work and/or be sold for income so it typically benefited enslavers to ensure babies and their mothers survived. 

All of that said, it's likely that American's collective understanding of Black women as frequent wet nurses and nannies is overblown. That is, it benefited enslavers for stories to emerge from the South that slaves were seen (and by implication, treated) as members of the family. That it was common to see a cheerful Black woman caring for their owners white children, perhaps even loving them more than they loved their own children. Sometimes the stories would even claim she loved those white children so much, she chose not to have a family of her own. Those stories, though, were simply a way of trying to disguise the brutal, inhuman conditions of chattel slavery."
AskHistorians,"Why are Europeans so obsessed with lions? They don't have any lions but they are there on flags, coat of arms, furniture and historical buildings","According to Michel Pastoureau, French Historian about symbolisms, the animals have virtues or sins associated to them. One of the most influencial authors during the Middle Age was Isidore of Sevilla, that wrote *The Etymologies* during the Seventh Century. He made several assumptions about animal's virtues. It was also there in Saint Augustin's works.

&#x200B;

According to Pastoureau, in Western Europe, the King of animals wasn't the lion in the beginning. It was the Bear. It's the animal most associated with the monarchy, especially in German lands such as England, Scandinavia and Germany. Among the warriors, he was also followed by the Boar.

Both represented Strength, bravery. The Bear was feared because of his wrath and the hunt for Boars was resulting in a one to one fight with a big stake. It needed mastery, knowledge, warrior capacities, strength and courage to fight these animals.

The famous ""King"" associated to Britain for example is King Arthur which means Bear... And his nickname is The Boar of Cornwall.

To point out the influence of these animals in Germanic lands, watch the names ! Björn, Beorn, Ber, Bern, Bero, Bera, Born, Per, Pern.

In German Legends, a young man sometimes becomes King or a warrior after killing a bear or a boar. There is a legend about Godefroi de Bouillon killing a bear, and it contributed to give him the ""throne of Jerusalem"" according to Pastoureau.

&#x200B;

But, one of the most influential books during the Middle Ages, not to say the most influential was the Bible itself. In the Bible, another animal is King, due to a long tradition coming from assirians Legends: The Lion. In the Bible, God is sometimes referred to as a lion. He represents strength, nobility, but also wrath.

&#x200B;

During the 12th Century and the beginning of Heraldry, in France and England we saw that the Lion took the Lion share in heraldry (15% of Heraldry represents a lion), becoming far more popular than the Bear. The most famous example is Richard Lionheart's Leopards (or Lions, in French heraldry, we call them Leopard or ""Lion Passants"" while lions to us is mostly called ""Lion Rampant"") that become the Flag of Normandy (I am from Normandy x) ) and the Flag of the England Monarchy during centuries.

First, there is the influence of the Norman Invasion in 1066 in England. The Normands elites that used heraldry were french and imposed their morals, and ideas such as knighthood in England. So the anglo-saxon/German Bear was already getting replace.

The Second reason for the Bear becoming replaced as King: religion. The priests hated the Bear, associating it to the old German Paganism. Also, Bears and boars were seemed by the religious men as lazy and lustful.  Sometimes men would drag as animals and often did Bears and boars. To the priests, it was dangerous because they feared that they could be animated by the animal's spirit, acting like these animals.

In Hagiography, there is countless examples of priests overcoming bears, boars, eagles and ravens. Pagan animals. According to Pastoureau, it helped to diminish their influence.

It can be observed elsewhere in medieval culture. In the representations of the Arch of Noe, it was commonly bears and Lions entering first, followed by boar and the deer. As time goes by, the Lion is the only one coming first.

In the *Roman of Renart* the Bear is vire roy while the Lion becomes the King.

&#x200B;

So, the Lion, also because it was a foreign animal (so aristocrats didn't hunt them) and of Biblical representation (Lions were often represented in churches) became the King of animals. There is the influence of the Normans in England. That's it. I will put a thesis on the boar, still from Pastoureau after for those interested. Sorry if I made mistakes in English, it's not my native language.

I am a student in representation of animals in Medieval History, my Master's projet is about the Boar and the Warrior cultures in England from the Seventh century to the XVth century so I must really dwell on it. Currently reading Beowulf and Richard III biography for this.

&#x200B;

What we can read in hunting books, it's that after the XIIIth century, the Deer became the most hunted animals by aristocrats and King. It replaced the Boar. While Pastoureau's thesis must be put in question there because there was already a royal reservations for Deers in England during William the Conqueror and a lot of hunting grounds were already reserved the Deers, even importing suedes from England to France during the the Anglo-Normand rule and the Plantagenet's dynasty.

According the Pastoureau, the Deer became this King's animal of hunt because the Boar was far too dangerous. For example, Boars killed Phillipe of France, heir to the French Crown during the XII century, putting Louis VII of France as the new heir. Phillippe Iv the Fair of France was also killed by a boar.

Priests hated the hunt because to them it didn't represent the Peace that Christiannity must give but accepted to let the Deer become this hunting prey because it was fearful. They even associated the deer to Chris."
AskHistorians,"In WW2, around 20 million Soviet men died, leaving sex ratios skewed. What was the effect of this on everyday life, dating, marriage and fertility rates?","In short, yes. I've written previously on the broader topic of Soviet pro-natalist policies in the period surrounding the war - [Did the USSR suffer from a reverse ""Baby Boom"", a slump in birth rates after World War II?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/635p76/did_the_ussr_suffer_from_a_reverse_baby_boom_a/dfrmlo2/) - of which I've reposted a revised version below:

----------

Throughout its history, while the USSR portrayed itself, rhetorically, as a country that practiced gender equality, and where women were given opportunities unavailable to their sisters in the West, the reality of life as a woman in the Soviet Union did not always live up to its promise, with pragmatic necessity of state aims often taking precedence, and the rhetoric of equality in constant tension with the ""traditional"" views of gender roles that remained strongly engrained within Soviet society. One of the clearest ways to trace this its through shifting approaches regarding women and motherhood, and the pro-natalist policies that drove those shifts. Looking at pro-natalist policies in the Soviet Union, especially with regards to abortion, we can see a *lot* of policy being driven by concerns about the birthrate, and its rise and fall. This is particularly evident in the periodic changes to the law concerning abortion, which teetered between pragmatic necessity and state needs for more manpower, as well as the state policies in the wake of the Second World War, where massive gender imbalances drove *temporary* changes in regards to state views on the importance of the nuclear family, and single-motherhood.

**Before the War**

In the Russian Empire, and the first few years of Bolshevik rule in Russia, abortion was illegal. But, as in most places where the procedure is illegal though, the procedure was nevertheless popular, but insanely dangerous. One observer pre-1920 noted:

>Within the past six months, among 100 to 150 young people under age 25, I have seen 15 to 20 percent of them making abortions without a doctor's help. They simply use household products: They drink bleach and other poisonous mixtures.

The decision to legalize the procedure, and make it simple to obtain, was almost entirely a practical decision. In 1920 they became legal if done by a doctor, essentially in acknowledgement that it would happen no matter what, so the state should do its best to make it safe. They were subsidized by the state, so free to the woman. In 1926, the abortion rate was 42.8 per 1000 working women, and 45.2 per 1000 'housewives' (compare to the US today, at [13.2 per 1000 women](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/). Modern Russia continues to be very high, at [37.4 per 1000 or so](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml))

But this wasn't to remain. As noted, the change was not because abortion was seen as *good*, but that legalizing it was a necessary evil and that the state would work to eliminate the underlying economic reasons driving women to have them. As it turned out, poor women were no more likely to be using this 'service though'. If anything, it was the better off women who were getting more abortions. Even worse, the birthrate in the USSR was falling precipitously, from 42.2 per 1000 in 1928 to 31.0 in 1932, according to a government study released in 1934. Thus the law changed in 1936 when policies started to return to pushing more 'traditional' gender roles for women, and included restricting abortion again - it required a medical reason now. As before though, just because it is illegal doesn't mean women don't seek them. After 1936, ""back-alley"" abortions were on the rise, and they certainly carried additional risks with them, and penalties for obtaining one meant injured women would only be further harmed by not seeking treatment:

>Women who became infected during these procedures or who sought assistance for heavy bleeding were often interrogated at the hospital before they were treated, as the authorities attempted to learn the names of underground abortionists. Abortionists were punished with one or two years’ imprisonment if they were physicians and at least three if they were not. The woman herself received a reprimand for her first offense and a fine if caught again. 

Abortion statistics aren't readily available for this period, but my book notes that as the birth rate didn't seem to change much - rising briefly through 1937 when it reached 39.6 per 1000 but again beginning to decline until leveling out at 33.6 per 1000 in 1940, the same rate as 1936 when the law went into effect - as the laws became restrictive again, this would imply women weren't especially deterred by the law and continued to seek them at the same rate as before (see 1926 numbers), if not higher. There was no ready access to, nor education regarding, other means of birth control (Aside from abortion as birth control, by far most common being 'coitus interruptus'), so it was really the only means of family planning available to women. 

**The Catastrophe of War**

While the Soviet state had been concerned about falling birthrates in the 1930s, this was a mere drop in the bucket compared to the absolute demographic devastation experienced from 1941 to 1945, which saw not only millions of citizens killed, but most critically men killed on a far greater scale than women, creating a gender significant imbalance. In the range specifically of 'childbearing age', there was estimated to be between 10 to 15 percent more women then men, sometimes refered to as ""war widows"", not only for those who lost a husband, but also those who lost the *potential* for a husband due to that decline. The result of this was a major, if temporary, shift in Soviet policies. Although there was a broad, general trend to encourage more childbirths, the 1944 Family Law, and subsequent policies of the period, were most notable perhaps for the specific focus in encouraging this demographic of women bereft of the opportunity to find a husband to nevertheless participate in their ""patriotic duty"" of bearing children for the motherland.

Soviet propaganda campaigns to encourage motherhood predated the war even but the massive calamity of course kicked it into overdrive. Even aside from the *deaths*, during the war, there was a definite decline in the birthrate due to ""*general decline in the reproductive health of mothers, as reflected in the high rate of premature births*"", as characterized by the People’s Commissar of Public Health G.A. Miterev, and Soviet leadership worked hard to try to turn that around, with their clear awareness that to see further decline would imperil the ability of the USSR to bounce back in the long term.

Programs and incentives to encourage motherhood existed, such as awards for bearing a certain number of children and various state assistance programs for both married and single mothers. It wasn't just carrots, but also sticks, most especially with the Family Law of 1944, which further penalized abortion and increasingly penalized divorce as well. The shortage of men also meant a very important shift in views regarding single motherhood and the importance of the nuclear family. While even earlier laws had provided benefits to mothers, they had been contingent on large families, with additional benefits, not to mention the medals and awards, usually restricted to mothers of seven or more children. The new landscape though required a significant shift, with Soviet authorities working to destigmatize single-motherhood by increasing state benefits they could receive *regardless* of the number of children, in comparison to their married counterparts and featuring mothers of ambiguous marital status in propaganda.

The changes also manifested in other spheres, although in some cases more tacitly. While the laws were clearly and openly designed to encourage motherhood, even for single women, that didn't make more men appear by magic to provide the other half of the equation. In the first, this simply meant that unmarried men were something of a 'prime commodity', and those not looking to settle down could find it very easy to bounce from relationship to relationship. This was helped greatly by laws which were passed to prevent single mothers from suing fathers for child support - after all, at least in theory the state was standing ready to provide full support if necessary - so even if they had several children with several women, there was little chance of being forced into a fatherly role. The state even, subtly, encouraged *married men* to have affairs with the ""war widows"", to help them along to motherhood, by tightening the divorce laws to make it harder for their irate wife to divorce them if the liaison was discovered.

AskHistorians,"In response to the First Continental Congress, British essayist Samuel Johnson wrote ""How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?"" How prevalent was this noted hypocrisy by British and Americans at the time?","More can always be said but I've written an answer on a similar question, relating to the dissonance between ownership of slaves and the rhetorical use of ""slavery"" in American discourse around the Revolution. I'll repost the OP below, but be sure to click through as soe of the follow-ups flesh things out more, even with an appearance of the quote from Johnson:

[Did Christopher Gadsden (Famous for the ""Don't Thread on Me"" flag) own slaves, and also, did he really oppose slavery? If so, did he ever free his own slaves?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/busvgg/did_christopher_gadsden_famous_for_the_dont/ephnkne/):

Gadsden (who fought a duel with Gen. Howe in 1778!) was a big, fat hypocrite, but he was also quite typical for his time, exemplifying a certain strain of American slaveholding intellectual who expressed moral opposition to slavery while at the same time not only owning slaves, but nothing to divest himself of them, and willing them to his children, rather than freeing them on his death as at least some of the more meek opponents did. The idea of Slavery was a key rhetorical device in the period, and in some ways helped to shape the concept of Liberty within the American discourse of the time, and Gadsden was no different, writing in 1769 pseudonymously as ""Pro Grege et Rege"" that:

>What is a slave but one that is at the will of his master, and has no property of his own, but on his most precarious tenure. [...] If we have but eyes that see, and ears that hear, we can not but discover that the deepest scheme of Systematical Slavery is preparing for Us, to which the [Townshend Duties] now complained of seem only to be mere preludes.

And likewise publishing that year as 'Americus Britannus' of his belief that their future was to be:

>riveted in a Slavery beyond Redemption, and by far exceeding that of the Subjects of any absolute Monarch in Europe, who have but *one* Master to please, and he *at Home* with them, whereas we at this vast Distance shall have some Hundreds at least, if the late measures are fixed upon us.

As to *actual* slaves, as opposed to the rhetorical slaves that he and other rich white men believed the Crown to be reducing them to, while his writings express some private reservations of the institution going back into the 1760s, far from showing any inclination to *free* his slaves, either in life or upon his death, he actually continued to purchase them, only *after* the Revolution becoming one of the largest owners of other human beings in South Carolina. 

Simply put, the objections that we often see from the slavers class in this period did a fairly good job keeping their objections not only theoretical, but quite often focused more on slavery's impact on *white* society, than on the persons who they continued to keep in bondage and exploit. In the wake of fears sparked by a small 1766 demonstration in Charleston by black men, Gadsden's concerns over slavery focused more on the dangers such a large population presented if they ever were to rise in opposition. Further too on a philosophical level he feared that the fears of such violence would promote a resistance by the whites' to their *own* fight for liberty, breeding in them a fear of resisting the encroachments of the Crown, accepting their own slavery for protection. 

However much he might have recognized the contradiction, it certainly never had any impact on his self-image as an honorable gentleman. Although he wrote favorably of the increase in customs duties required for kidnapped humans by the 1764 Law, and would much later write to Washington urging restrictions on the slave trade, it was much more a reflection of his position on limiting further growth than ending slavery. At least as late as 1762, he himself had been paying duties to import human cargo, and Gadsden's Wharf, a centerpiece of his mercantile business, would continue to dock others well after.

Certainly, it did impact his views on the future settlement of the colony, and he was a strong advocate for the increased growth of small farmers, who owned no slaves, which he saw as a necessary and important counterbalance to ensure the increase of the white population and ensure their majority over the enslaved population. Despite being a planter himself of course and harboring visions of ever increasing holdings, not to mention an owner of many enslaved persons, he considered himself to be an advocate for the smallholders, and pushed for the planter class to be more supportive of their growth. Opposition to slavery played in here too, although again, not due to how it harmed those enslaved, but how it harmed those free. The planters had an obligation to support white artisans and not pawn off such tasks to their imprisoned laborers. Slavery was a danger to Liberty here, its existence robbing white-men of opportunity for honest skilled labor.

During the war itself, again, whatever his philosophical opposition to the *idea* of slavery, he was much more concerned with practical concerns. When the Laurens', both (cautious) advocates for emancipation saw a way to help the war effort and bring about an end to slavery in their state by encouraging Congress to enlist some 3,000 South Carolina slaves in the Army with promise of freedom for service (and what he would have been paid going to their owner), the idea was resoundingly defeated by the lawmakers back in the state, including Gadsden who wrote to Sam Adams that:

>We are much disgusted here at the Congress recommending us to arm our Slaves, it was received with great resentment, as a very dangerous and impolitic Step.

More than anything, it again points to the fears that drive Gadsden's misgivings a decade earlier, the fear of the armed black man, the fear of servile insurrection, and the fear of what it could wreck upon white society. Similarly, near the end of the war when he expressed opposition to an agreement with the British that would return escaped slaves to their enslavers, Gadsden's opposition was much more driven by business concerns, since in exchange British merchants were given six months to sell their wares before having to leave Charles Town, and grudges, as most of the black persons slated to lose their freedom came from the low-country, the planters of which Gadsden believed to have been lacking in support for the war, and undeserving of such assistance. Making his case to the Governor, he wrote:

>The inhabitants near the sea are principally concerned in negroes - has their conduct during this campaign been so particularly meritorious? [Their] interest has indisputably occasioned more danger to the State than their fellow citizens, with less of that kind of property. [...] Have they not excepting a very few been the most backward in the State during these critical times to turn out?

Gadsden's counter proposal that some who had traded with the British be hanged for Sedition was not adopted instead, and while he might have smirked that the British renegged, and returned few of the former slaves, it was little comfort to them, as it is surmised that they were mostly sold off in the West Indies by the British officers looking to pad out their pay, rather than granted the promised freedom. In any case though his remarks reflected less opposition to *slavery* than they did his populist focus on the interests of smalltime white farmers and tradesmen, although in he would temper this too, musing on whether artisans rioting in Charles Town not long after that was *""a Disease amongst us far more dangerous than anything that can arise from the whole present Herd of contemptible exportable Tories.""*

Again though, this was typical, and if anything, Gadsden is a fairly mild example of such hypocrisy. The Laurens', already mentioned for their plan *in favor* of emancipation, are emblematic of this. Deeply involved in the slave trade through the 1760s, the death of John in 1782, who had been the driving force in the family more than his father Henry, ensured that whatever slim chance might have existed dissipated, and although Henry would continue to occasionally mention his abhorrence of slavery in conversations, at best it was a vision of a nominally free, but nevertheless subservient underclass, ""*a separate people, subjected to special laws, kept harmless, made useful and freed from the tyranny and arbitrary power of individuals*"". In any case, of the 300 people whom he owned, only a single one was ever freed by him, and that upon his death."
AskHistorians,Who decided on the English names of the translated Jewish Bible's books?,"The question has an incorrect premise. The books of the Torah/Pentateuch were not originally titled as books are today. The current Hebrew names should not be seen as the true, correct, or original names that were changed in translation. Rather, there were multiple ways to refer to the texts in the ancient world. 

Within the Jewish tradition, Shemot (Names) was also referred to as Sefer Yetziat Mitzrayim (The Book of the Exodus from Egypt). Viyikra (And He Called) was also referred to as Torat Kohanim (The Law of the Priests). Bamidbar (In the Desert/Wilderness) was also referred to as Pekuddim (counting). D’varim (The Words) was referred to as Mishneh Torah (The Repeated Law – not to be confused with the 12th c. CE text by Maimonides of the same name)

These names are roughly analogous the to the English names “Exodus,” “Leviticus” (referring to Levites, the priestly tribe), Numbers, and Deuteronomy (“Second Law” in Greek). These English names comes from the Greek Septuagint, which was written by Hellenistic Jews. The difference in contemporary Pentateuch/Torah book titling between the Hebrew and English is not a result of mistranslation but rather due to the fact that there were multiple ways to refer to the text in the ancient world."
AskHistorians,"It's 112 AD, and I'm a middle class Roman citizen. Is it safe for me to travel to any part of the empire, or are there still cities/provinces that are inherently dangerous?","The ""Pax Romana"" was a real phenomenon, as much as one can criticize its definition of ""Peace"" or how the ""Pax"" gets confused with an idyllic vision of society free from struggle and strife, the period of roughly the first and second centuries CE were remarkably low in large scale violence by the standards of the region. I do think it is worth keeping that in mind when talking about banditry, crime endemic low level conflict, etc, because one can really only understand this period as a whole if we understand an environment of generally lower violence.

That being said, ""less violence than sixteenth century Europe"" is a very far cry from ""no violence"". On the low end, crime was prevalent. We cannot say more than that, and any attempts to quantify an ancient crime rate should be treated with extreme suspicion, but we do know that crime and violence was something people worried about. Most famously the satirist Juvenal said it is simply irresponsible to leave your home at night without first drawing up your will, and while there is plenty of reason to doubt his satires as actual empirical descriptions of Roman life, it must at least reflect present anxieties. There were also bandits outside of the city, this is complicated to discuss because of the way the term *latro* (bandit, robber) was applied to anyone who resisted the Roman state and thus was conflated with broader phenomena, but at least we can say that travel between cities in parts was thought risky enough that it was best done in a group.

That being said, I suspect you are asking less about a knife in a dark alley and more about areas of general lawlessness, where the Roman state struggled or even failed to establish its authority, and these also existed. One of the more well known examples is Isauria in the south of what is today Turkey, a rugged and mountainous land with inhabitants that can be roughly equated to the Chinese imperial concept of internal barbarians. Several times throughout history the area required full scale military campaigns of suppression and it remained under only partial control well into the Middle Ages. Sardinia is another region, the interior of which is still today called ""Barbagia"" derived from the Latin ""Barbaria"" or ""barbarian"".

Beyond areas we know about historically, there are also regions where the remains of Roman military architecture implies continuous struggle for control. For example, there is a high concentration of Roman ""fortlets"" (mini forts containing small detachments of infantry and cavalry) along the Exmoor coast, in northern Cornwall. There is no certainty about what their exact function is but they were likely some protection from coastal raiding, perhaps from Ireland, but also perhaps from Wales. Wales itself had a very large Roman military presence, most likely there to protect the mines, but that requires something to protect the mines from. And in modern Romania, the concentration and arrangement of Roman forts around the Carpathian was such that I went to a presentation calling it a ""counter-insurgency"" deployment.

As far as I am aware there has never been a work trying to bring these all together and describe the ""lawless"" regions of Rome and the ""internal barbarians"". That does not mean there is not one though and given current interests in history in general I would be shocked if one was very far away. But absent that we can say yes, there were areas that were not fully or even at all under the control of Roman authorities. Whether that meant they were *dangerous* or just that you would need to make special arrangements to go there (deal with local ""kings"" etc) cannot really be said without statistics we simply do not have."
AskHistorians,Is China’s 5000 Years of History a National Myth?,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am someone with quite a narrow specialism. I specifically study the Qing Empire, an entity that existed for 'only' 276 of the supposed 5000 years of Chinese history from 1636 to 1912, and whose status within 'Chinese' history has been bitterly contested ever since. While I do read more broadly, it does mean that my thinking on the whole is ultimately framed by some quite specific controversies, and would not necessarily represent the same sorts of views that might be held by a historian of pre-imperial or of modern China.

There are any number of ways to critique the '5000 years of history' concept, but one thing to note which I think is important and instructive is that China has not always had 5000 years of history. By this, I mean that over the course of the 20th century, there were enormous shifts back and forth over when and where China's origins should be located. The Neo-Confucian view had been that although documentary evidence did not extend before the Eastern Zhou period (771-256 BCE), the limited records of the earlier Xia and Shang and China's broader mythic history were at least substantively true. However, the New Culture Movement of the 1910s spawned an influential intellectual movement called the Doubting Antiquity School, which conjectured that much of the narrative of Xia and Shang history found in the Zhou chronicles had been fundamentally distorted to suit political agendas and/or to align these texts with contemporary social and cultural trends. While the Doubting Antiquity scholars never outright rejected the notion of Chinese history before the Eastern Zhou, they nevertheless fundamentally challenged the received wisdom about Chinese mythic history, and asserted that the facts were not to be found in the sources, but rather in a critical reading of them.

Today, the Doubting Antiquity school has fallen out of favour amid the rise of a so-called 'Believing Antiquity' school, which argues that archaeological discoveries have largely affirmed the Zhou chronicles, and that they should in fact be regarded as reliable. Critics, of course, have pointed out that this has a tendency to lead to the rather credulous position held by some nationalistic scholars, that if specific archaeological evidence proves the authenticity and/or accuracy of a part or whole of a particular text, then the concept of archaeology as a whole can be invoked to defend the authenticity and accuracy of *any* text. Martin Kern, a German scholar of pre-imperial China based in the US, has an interesting if polemical discussion of this in a recent book chapter which I would recommend for anyone looking to follow up, or to read an anti-nativist perspective from an actual specialist in the field of early China.

I think we also ought to account for the existence of a couple of paths not taken, or at least not sustained. The Sino-Babylonian theory, first proposed by Albert Terrien de Lacouperie in 1892 and introduced to Chinese audiences in 1900 by Japanese scholars, proposed that Chinese civilisation actually originated in Mesopotamia. A tribal leader, later identified as the Yellow Emperor, was supposed to have brought his people into China around 2300 BCE and supplanted the existing population. The Japanese transmission of the theory also transmuted it somewhat, as whereas Lacouperie proposed a shared mythology between Mesopotamian and early Chinese religion, the Japanese commentators argued that the mythic figures of Chinese antiquity were in fact historical figures of Mesopotamia: Shennong (creator of agriculture) was in fact Sargon of Akkad, Cang Jie (creator of writing) was in fact Dungi of Ur, and Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor) was the human antecedent of the sun god Nakhunte. Sino-Babylonianism actually ended up being reasonably mainstream, even making it into a draft of one of the many Republican national anthems, but it would end up being short-lived. The Doubting Antiquity School obviously had a field day, and new archaeological discoveries showed that Lacouperie's chronology didn't line up anyway, with evidence for Chinese material culture predating the supposed 2300 BCE migration. But, for a not-insubstantial number of people from 1900 to around the mid-1930s, the idea that Chinese history began as an offshoot of Mesopotamian history some 4200 years earlier was entirely credible.

And then there are the times that China in the 20th century attempted to specifically reinvent itself as a 'modern' state, discontinuous from its 'traditional' past. The Cultural Revolution serves as the most prominent case-in-point, given that one of its most visible manifestations was the overt destruction of cultural relics and historical objects, predicated on the idea that Chinese history would begin again with the Revolution. Destruction was never total, and it is worth pointing out that there were a number of successful efforts to protect cultural relics using the rhetoric of the revolution: for instance, some denounced book-burning because that would mean their contents would no longer be available for criticism(!) and thereby saved numerous works from destruction. But while the Cultural Revolution failed in practice, its aims on principle were no less clear. The perceived excesses of the Cultural Revolution may well have been a major factor in why there has been such insistence on the '5000 years' concept in the decades since, as an overreaction to the period's iconoclasm.

But there are other possible critiques that we can (and indeed, I will) get into. I've discussed the problem of specifically state continuity before in [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wc8uwr/why_has_china_repeatedly_reunified_and_splintered/iic6g70/?context=999) and in [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10wj2lk/in_large_parts_of_chinese_history_china_has_been/), but to put it succinctly, the entire sequence of imperial succession is illusory. Empires and would-be empires contended against each other on the regular, and as a general rule only the 'winners' get to be part of that succession, with periods of disunity either elided, or specifically framed around the efforts of those who either remained loyal to the old empire or would go on to found the new one (case in point being the Three Kingdoms period, where historically Wei was lionised, and latterly Shu-Han, but never Wu). And even then, at times the 'winners' get disregarded, particularly in the case of non-Han Chinese states. The Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin states, despite being peer rivals of the Song, are conveniently elided from the dynastic succession, while the status of the Mongol Yuan and Manchu Qing has always been a contentious one. For a particularly potent illustration, take the common assertion that the Qing lasted from 1644 to 1911. It didn't, it lasted from 1636 to 1912. 1644 was not the start of the Qing but the fall of the Ming; 1911 was not the end of the Qing but the beginning of the Republic. Traditional chronology is sufficiently petty to actively try to erase years from the Qing Empire in the interests of Chinese nativism.

And then you run into the problem that the 'national' or 'civilisational' history of China is exclusively focussed on the core region that ultimately produced the Han Chinese people. Does the history of the people of the Tarim Basin also extend back 5000 years, simply because the present-day People's Republic of China (PRC) rules the Tarim Basin? Because if so, why is the history of the Sogdians or the Tocharians not part of Chinese history? We can ask the same for the Tungusic peoples of Manchuria, of the Miao, the Hmong, the Tai, the Zhuang, and all the other indigenous peoples of southern and southwestern China, living and dead. We can ask the same of Tibet and of Mongolia, conceivably Taiwan too. When China says it has 5000 years of history, it's not giving equal weight to all the histories of all the peoples and regions that today make up the PRC. It can be used to cleverly elide that not all of China has always been China, or to present the specific story of the Han Chinese, and their expansion across what is now the territory of the People's Republic, as the prime story among many. Neither of these, I would suggest, should be looked on favourably.

AskHistorians,Has anyone ever actually avenged their murdered monarch parent and reclaimed their kingdom?,"Depending on how you define ""avenged"" and ""reclaimed"", the restoration of the Monarchy under King Charles II certainly fits the bill. 

Charles II's father, Charles I of House Stuart, ascended the throne in 1625, ruling until his execution in 1649. Much of Charles' reign was characterized by quarrel with the Parliament. During this time, European monarchies were moving away from decentralized-feudally-structured systems towards increasingly centralized *absolute* monarchies, and Charles I, believing in his *divine right to rule* desired much the same. English monarchs, for a few reasons, could/did not achieve the same degree of authority as did, for example, their Russian or French counterparts, but that did not stop Charles I's consistent efforts towards limiting and ignoring Parliamentary authority. This was particularly relevant in his unpopular wars with France and Spain; war is expensive, Charles I needed considerable supplies, Parliament did not consistently grant him adequate ""tunnage and poundage"", so he took what was needed and, on more than one occasion, dissolved Parliament. Additionally, Charles I's marriage to a Catholic, his support for high church ecclesiastics in Anglicanism (which by some was seen as back slipping towards Catholic ""popery""), and lack of support for Protestants in continental conflicts, further made him unpopular. 

In brief, these transgressions led to the English Civil War, with the Parliamentary New Model Army eventually beating the Royalist forces, executing Charles I, and  establishing the Commonwealth of England. As is not uncommon in these affairs, the resulting government was little, if at all, better than its predecessor, conflict did not magically cease, and the lives of citizens - nobles and commoners alike - were subject to greater instability. 

Accordingly, in April, 1660, General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, and arguably the single most powerful individual in the nation following Oliver Cromwell's death, wrote to Charles II (at the time exiled in continental Europe) requesting his return to England and the throne. Monck wrote of the ""sad and lamentable"" condition of Britain, remarking that the revolutionaries hated the name of the king, but ""joyfully embrace\[d\] the power thereof."" He states that he and the nation desired a restoration of the monarchy and Charles II's return, but, under three conditions which would be essential to the success of their venture. One, respect the ownership and rights of land acquired lawfully in his absence. Two, spare the lives of those who worked to usurp him and his father so long as they offer their humble submission. Three, to make good on the debts owed to the soldiery, even those who fought against him. Charles II's response was one of measured glee, willfully agreeing to the terms proposed by Monck, thanking him, and speaking to his quick desire to make good on the plan. 

Charles II would eventually return, be crowned king, and oversee the restoration of the monarchy. He was generally true to his word regarding Monck's proposals, though his rule was in no way characterized by a meek overlordship wherein his decisions were thoroughly guided by nobles and advisors. He did well in consolidating his power, disbanding the remnants of Parliamentary forces, establishing an extensive police force the likes of which had never been seen before, and was sometimes abrasive to his opponents in a way not so unlike his father. 

So, I would say, yes, kind of. While he maybe did not ""avenge"" his father with a gory comeuppance, he did reclaim - or reestablish - his kingdom, with the help of existing powers there, reviving his fathers legacy and ensuring the continuation of the British monarchy into the present day."

AskHistorians,"Does my grandmother ""count"" as a holocaust survivor?","In a way, this is a subjective question and opinions will vary. I can see how your father and others might want to reserve a special category for those in the camps themselves. However, we can look at what memorial institutions consider to be a Holocaust survivor, and that will point us to a more broad definition that has been used in practice for decades. 

For example, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has a Survivors Registry division that collects and archives survivor information, stories, and interviews. According to its definition of ""[Who is a survivor](https://www.ushmm.org/remember/holocaust-survivors)?"":

>Holocaust survivors are Jews who experienced the persecution and survived the mass murder that was carried out by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945. This included those who were in concentration camps, killing centers, ghettos, and prisons, as well as refugees or those in hiding. Holocaust survivors also include people who did not self-identify as Jewish, but were categorized as such by the perpetrators.  
>  
>Roma and Sinti, Poles and other Slavic peoples, Soviet prisoners of war, persons with disabilities, political prisoners, trade union leaders, “subversive” artists, those Catholic and Lutheran clergy who were seen as opponents of the regime, resisters, Jehovah’s Witnesses, male homosexuals, and criminal offenders, among others were also victims of Nazi persecution.

So that definition overtly includes ""refugees or those in hiding,"" not just those in the camps. Within the USHMM oral history collection, there are a lot with survivors who were not in camps -- which makes sense, considering the death rates. From my memory of interviews in the collection, there are stories of hiding in barns, escaping to other countries ahead of the Nazis, living in the woods with partisans, fleeing to Italy and being held on a sort of prison island... all kinds of stories of persecution and loss that go beyond the camps alone.

Another institution, the Museum of Tolerance, features live survivor talks. A quick check of their [current schedule](https://www.museumoftolerance.com/education/special-speakers/hear-a-holocaust-survivor/) shows several who survived the war in hiding. 

The Illinois Holocaust Museum features a very cool ""[interactive hologram](https://www.ilholocaustmuseum.org/exhibitions/survivor-stories-experience/)"" interview with a survivor. (They filmed a bunch of different conversations and anecdotes, and turned it into a hologram. You can ask the hologram a question and it will answer from its video files. It's neat!) At least one of those is a survivor who was a child in hiding.

So with those examples, we can see that the institutions of memory are pretty united on the broader view of survivorship, rather than the more limited one your father proposed. In my experience it's the consensus view of the historical community, which is generally not interested in debating ""who had it worst?"" and reserving labels for some and not others. It's better to take each person's story on its own terms, and understand that there were many different persecutions and acts of terror that added up to the big thing we call The Holocaust. And so there can be many different types of survivors."

AskHistorians,Why did Japan bomb Pearl Harbor?,"There is always a lot that can be said but there is a lot that goes into understanding this topic.

First, we have to understand Japanese imperialism and the divide between the Army and the Navy. The Japanese had been invested in a war with China for years by the time of Pearl and they eventually had the goal to conquer Mongolia and Siberia. The Japanese Army high command had saw great value in the resources and fuel in Russia and they had believed an invasion of the Soviet Union would not result in a major war with the rest of Western Europe or the United States.  It's important to note the Army had not made itself to fight western powers, it was made to fight small Armies in Asia.

The Navy had different plans. They had wanted to advance southward into the Pacific islands and into French Indochina through to India. This plan, called the Southern Plan, was not at all supported by the Japanese Army as it meant a guaranteed war with the Western Powers, something the Army had not been equipped to fight. The Japanese Navy by contrast was built with the intent purpose to do battle with the United States and Great Britain.

This, however, was not the end of the rivalry as it went much deeper. 

In the decades prior to the war, the Japanese Army and Navy had always been fighting for resource dominance in Japan's GDP. Many large businesses in Japan had been either pro-Navy or pro-Army families and the recruitment tactics of each branch had varied greatly. The Navy relied on volunteers and fishermen whereas the Army relied on conscription and Farmers. This reliance on conscripts became a source of mockery for the Army by Admirals as the Navy saw this reliance a farce, a true Soldier, or in this case Sailor, must volunteer his service and life to the Navy. A volunteer is more willing to obey and follow orders than a lowly conscript. 

At worst, this rivalry saw Japanese military officials assassinate politicians in bids for power and resources. The resources in Japan were limited to begin with and getting every bit of that budget mattered to the higher-ups in the military. Unfortunately for the Army, by the time World War II started the government had been largely pro-Navy. The war in China had been going poorly and by 1939 stalemated. The losses in life were piling up and the Army's resources were depleting so they began pushing down in the South Pacific.

This had been Navy territory, they were after the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina. If the Army were to secure these resources, the Navy would have never seen it be used for themselves. So in lieu of this, and the massive embargos on Japanese oil by the United States, the Navy had plan: attack the United States and grab South Asia as quick as it can and use its resources to prepare for war.

The Navy hadn't expected to win a war with the U.S, it was the opposite. Many of the  Japanese high command had known they'd lose a war with the U.S. The Plan by the Navy was simple: destroy the fleet at Pearl Harbor and use the time it took the U.S to get ships rebuilt/repaired to grab every colony they could in Asia. They had hoped the newly found resources by the Japan would deter the U.S from ever attacking Asia, this also came with the benefit of proving to the Japanese government the Navy was superior and deserved an even higher stake within the war for resources the two branches of service had waged between each other.

AskHistorians,"Why did the CIA Director Richard Helms order for employees of CIA to destroy, in 1973, many classified files pertaining to MKUltra, namely their work with LSD?","Near the end of his life, Richard Helms wrote a memoir with
the the author William Hood, _A Look Over My Shoulder: A Life 
in the Central Intelligence_. He does not mention MKULTRA 
anywhere in his memoir, nor Sidney Gottlieb, the ""Poisoner
in Chief"" who headed the program.

When an interviewer asked him why, Helms gave an evasive answer:

>I see no way to handle it in the amount of space I have available.

and gave a similar answer regarding Gottlieb: ""...to bail
him out of the troubles he's in would take more than just
a few minutes, and I'm not sure I'd be much of a contributor
to it.""

Fortunately, he was asked rather directly about the destruction,
and fairly shortly after the events in question: in testimony given in 1975. He states
destroying the records was originally Gottlieb's idea, and that ""part of our reason"" for the destruction was to protect ""relationships with outsiders in government agencies"" so that ""anybody who has assisted us in the past would not be subject to follow up, or questions, embarrassment, if you will.""

Some unpacking here: Helms was very, very, serious about
keeping CIA secrets; as his memoir states, he
""believed in the ban against revelation of intelligence secrets""
and by all accounts was deeply upset at William Colby (the
follow-up director) being so up-front about various CIA
programs, explicitly stating ""he should have kept his mouth
shut."" He was so convinced of the CIA's oath to secrecy
that he violated an oath before congress to tell the truth,
and was convicted of lying about CIA meddling in Chile (the
only Director of Central Intelligence to have this happen).

This level of secret-keeping means that we cannot take his personal testimony entirely at face value. However, if this was a lie, it was one of omission, as there truly were quite a number of outside entities involved. The 1977 MKUltra report from the Senate committee, part of which involved scrounging for new documents, noted the involvement ""185 non-government researchers and assistants who are identified in the recovered material dealing with the 149 subprojects"" as well as ""44 colleges or universities"", ""12 hospital or clinics"", and ""3 penal institutions"".

The same report notes $375,000 given to a medical institution (not named in the report, but [it was Georgetown University Medical School](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/04/archives/80-institutions-used-in-cia-mind-studies-admiral-turner-tells.html)). While the Church Committee already had found evidence of this donation, the newly found materials in 1977 also explicitly indicate it was done in a way to appear as a private donation, rather than one done through the CIA.

Regarding the desire to suppress connectivity with specific individuals, a 1963 Report of Inspection of MKULTRA mentions some experiments being ""professionally unethical"" and so it puts the reputation of the participants at research. A later lawsuit tried to use the Freedom of Information Act force disclosure (so victims could be informed), with a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court, in *CIA v. Sims* (1985). (The Supreme Court decided for the CIA with the reasoning that this would ""force the CIA to disclose a source"", which is an exception under the law.) We have enough information (thanks to the previously mentioned 1977 committee and the Church one before) to say we have a reasonable picture of the various CIA programs; what is lacking, due to the lack of disclosures, is knowing all the people who are involved.

There may also not have been as much written material as you might think. A great deal of information was only given orally; the 1963 inspection report mentions a policy to ""maintain no records of the planning and approval"" specifically for the LSD program, potentially due to ""illegality"". 

Probably the most interestingly contentious aspect is whether human radiation experiments happened; they were also mentioned in the '63 report, but [a committee in 1995 examined the question thoroughly](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Final_Report_Sources_and_documentation/7e3aAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) and it appears that while such experiments were considered, they were never implemented.

AskHistorians,What was the deal with bullet bras in the 1950s? Why did they become a trend? Were they seen as scandalous or confusing or otherwise cause much backlash or cultural debate? Why did people want it to look like they had 2 traffic cones on their chest?,"Oddly enough, I already have an answer to this question! [The original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7fy1hh/why_were_womens_ah_undies_noticeably_more_pointy/dqfnnta/) has illustrative links sprinkled throughout it, but I've copied the text below: (Edit - links added!)

The answer has a lot to do with the materials and methods of construction used in brassieres in the twentieth century.

During the first decade of the century, the overall focus of the corset was moving lower, with the lower edge covering more of the hips and the top edge doing less and less to support, as the fashionable figure changed from [the upright Victorian hourglass](http://kent.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/B447A10A-8732-45B6-ADD6-049454674700) to [the forward-tilted Edwardian S-bend](http://kent.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/55DB65D9-D916-40BB-B1C0-419716969510) with its full, low bust. While some women simply went with it, others required *something* supportive to replace the higher corset, and the brassiere was invented. At this time, [the brassiere](https://patents.google.com/patent/US933265A/en?q=brassiere&before=priority:19091231&after=priority:19000101) was a fitted but unboned garment worn on top of the corset (and therefore also on top of the chemise under the corset) that typically went down to the waist, rather than just being for the upper torso. The support it provided was based on the tension of the fabric, which would mainly work to hold the bust in a ""natural"" position, rather than pushing it up in the way many now think of as the primary purpose of a bra.

Over the course of the 1910s, the bottom half of the garment was abandoned, essentially, bringing it to something we recognize more easily as a brassiere, as in [this version](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/109121). (The use of heavy cotton lace or material covered with eyelet embroidery was very common by the end of the decade.) As you can see in the linked example, the idea of ""cups"" was simply not present, and the basic flat/gently rounded shape continued to be used into the 1920s.  Brassieres of the early 1920s tended to be heavier material intended to compress, while the [lightweight bandeaux](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/83316) made out of sheer silk and/or delicate lace date to the end of the decade - it's possible that this represents a shift, with bras coming to be conceived of as something all women would wear, and therefore lighter versions that wouldn't actually do much to support the bust started to be made.

Early in the 1930s, the flattened look left fashion, but the brassiere remained. (So did the corset/girdle, but it was strictly a below-the-bust garment by this time, except when girdle and brassiere were combined into one, as the ""corselet"".) The bra took on the responsibility of bust definition, which required shaping. A *lot* of experimentation went on in the interwar period as to construction techniques to achieve this, but the most common method was for each cup to be made out of an upper and a lower piece shaped in convex curves, with a horizontal seam across them, [like so](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/84257). Another common method, though a bit less common, was the use of [one or two darts to shape each cup](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/84259). Both of these methods, particularly if stiffened with quilting to support a larger bust, tend to produce a rather pointed shape - and it has to be said again that the desired shape was *still* not very ""pushed up"", with the volume instead pushed (or, perhaps it's more accurate to say allowed to flow) outward. In most cases, the effect was relatively subtle, but then there are the few with more extreme points - typically formed by the use of shaped padding worn on a smaller bust - that get posted all over the internet as normal examples, because the internet loves to take things out of context.

The more structured type of brassiere began to fall out of favor in the 1960s, as the concept of the ""natural"", unaided figure (unaided except by the proper genes that would give you the shape deemed fashionable) came back in. Rudi Gernreich's ""[no bra](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/86537)"" is often given a certain amount of credit here for capturing the anti-artificiality spirit of the time - as you can see, there's essentially nothing supportive about it, so only a slender and small-chested woman would be able to comfortably wear it. The [molded foam cup](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/108873) (now typically used in bra construction) came in in the late 1960s or early 1970s, helping women who couldn't just be ""natural"" leave behind the brassieres with cups shaped with seaming or darts."
AskHistorians,Why are the Faroe Islands special? They are exceptions in nearly all treaties denmark is involved in,"The Faroe Islands have a history and language distinct from mainland Denmark, a strong sense of national identity, and a parliament with many devolved powers. As a former Danish colony, they are still a functional part of Denmark, and there is a long-standing divide within the islands about whether to maintain these ties or to forge their own path as a sovereign nation. Being able to assert their sovereignty in trade deals with the EU, and military treaties, is one way that the Faroes have wielded their rights under ""Home Rule.""

Despite being a longtime Viking settlement, the islands were isolated enough to form their own language. As European nation-states developed, the Faroes were owned by Norway, then the Kalmar Union. In 1662, colonialist Denmark required the Faroese legislature (the *Løgtingið*) to pledge its devotion to the Danish crown, and the Danes enforced a system of legal dominion over the islands. 

The legacy of strict Danish rule is found in Faroese literature such as the 1933 poem ""Viðoy"" by Christian Madras, which depicts the islands as a fleet of ships that must sail northwest--away from Denmark. The poem alludes to an 18th century work by folk hero Nólsoyar-Páll, who used metaphor to compare the Danish monopoly on Faroese trade to large birds preying on smaller, meeker ones. Nólsoyar-Pall posthumously became an important figure in the Faroes' ""romantic nationalist awakening"" of the late 1800s (Adler-Nissen). Around this time, a flourishing movement of literary and language preservation, embodied in groups like the Faroese Association, gave rise to a unified Faroese identity and contributed to the islands' sense of independence.

During World War II, the United Kingdom managed the Faroes as a protectorate while Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. Fish were traded from the Faroe Islands to the British Isles, and in general the Faroese people had a taste of life out from underneath the thumb of Danish control. Once the war ended and the islands were returned to Denmark, the Faroes held a referendum on independence in September of 1946. The result was close: 5,660 votes for self-rule and 5,499 for union. Instead of recognizing this result and losing another piece of their former empire (Iceland had voted to break ties with the Danish monarchy during the war), the Danish government dissolved the Faroese parliament and called for a new election which was won by unionist parties. Ceding some ground to the independence movement, Denmark worked with the friendly Faroese government to establish Home Rule in 1948. Under this arrangement, ""matters of common interest"" would be handled by Danish authorities, and ""matters of local interest"" would be handled by Faroese authorities (Adler-Nissen). The result was more autonomy for the islands, which has expanded as the decades have progressed.

The Faroes did not join Denmark in entering the European Community (predecessor to the European Union) in 1973. This was a means of maintaining political sovereignty, as entering the pact would have meant being under the jurisdiction of not just one but two higher authorities. The ability to control fishing territory and regulations was a substantial factor in this position. Instead, the islands established their own treaties with the EU: ""The EU's official relationship with the Faroe Islands is regulated by two bilateral agreements - a bilateral fisheries agreement from 1977 and a free trade agreement from 1991 last revisited in 1998"" (Malloy).

In 2001, the pro-independence Løgting's proposal for a referendum on a ""constitution for a sovereign Faroe Island state in 'free association' with Denmark"" ws rejected by the Danish government after negotiations stalled (Adler-Nissen). Once again, this led to the Danes increasing the islands' home rule powers with legislation like the 2005 Foreign Policy Powers Act, which allowed greater freedom in associating with other nations, especially in issues of fishing. As summed up by Rebecca Adler-Nissen, ""by threatening to claim indpendence, one can obtain something else; not necessarily sovereignty, but both political and economic gains.""

If the Faroes were to join the EU, it would almost certainly mean an end to the traditional practices of pilot whaling, bird hunting, and sheep slaughtering. Accordingly, there is dispute among Faroese politicians about whether to become closer to the EU or to keep a distance. The independentist, left-wing Republic party's view is that ""the ultimate aim of Faroese independence is not isolation, but participation in globalization independently of Denmark... to diversify the relations to the outside world"" (Adler-Nissen). Meanwhile, the conservative People's Party believe in an independent Faroes based on internal culture and identity, and not on a tighter bond with Europe and beyond. Two other main parties on the islands, which advocate for continued unionism, are the Social Democratic Party and the Union Party, which are center-left and center-right, respectively. 

EU aside, another, less formal grouping of regional entities is the NORA Region, which strives for economic cooperation among territories and countries in the North Atlantic. Under the oversight of the Nordic Council of Ministers and developed in 1998, this organization is comprised of the Faroes, Greenland, Iceland, and coastal Norway. Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroes, is host to NORA's administrative offices. By acting in partnership with their neighbors, especially through their fishing economy, the Faroe Islands attempts to prove itself as an integral boon to the region's prosperity and gain further legitimacy as an actor independent of Denmark.

Thus, the Faroes maintain their autonomy from Denmark by not only asserting their rights to a cultural identity, but also a political one that has independence in determining internal policies as well as forging distinct relations with other nations, regions, and territories. I do not have specific knowledge on their relationship to NATO, but perhaps someone else can provide this.

AskHistorians,What did Karl Marx think of the American Civil War?,"The short answer is that Marx was opposed to slavery and was supportive of the North due to this, especially as emancipation did become an end goal of the war for the North.

There are multiple negative references to slavery as a exploitative system in Marx's work and even that in the US that ""the workingmen [...] allowed slavery to defile their own republic"". Perhaps of specific note for your question are these comments in a 1861 letter to his writing partner Friedrich Engels

>In my view, the most momentous thing happening in the world today is, on the one hand, the movement among the slaves in America, started by the death of [John] Brown, and the movement among the slaves in Russia, on the other … I have just seen in the Tribune that there was a new slave uprising in Missouri, naturally suppressed. But the signal has now been given. ^^^4

Marx actually wrote about the American Civil War so we can focus on what we know he actually said based on newspaper articles he wrote at the time. In these articles he is writing in the context of arguing against other views being put forward on the war at the time but they are quite clearly laying out his views.

Despite being generally supportive of ending slavery and the North Marx did not see the war as a war started and waged for abolitionist ends to begin with. He argued it was a war between a pro-slavery South, which saw the basis for establishing slavery in the border states and preserving it in the South from within the Union disappearing, and a pro-union North that was less concerened with ending slavery than preserving the union.

**What did Marx think the war was about?**

Marx argued that the South had to fight the war because without ""conquest"" it would lose it's capacity to continue on the same economic basis and therefore defeat the point of secession. While the North had to fight because to cede peacefully to theSouth would surrender too much important territory, and even that the loss of some areas could create a knock-on effect toward succession, for example that the loss of the mouth of the Mississippi would create economic pressure on Missiori and Ohio to join the South. Marx even speculated that outside of the New England area there could be a snowball effect which would lead a South, that had been allowed to peacefully secede, to become the dominant power in the area that would have once been united under the United States (unclear exactly what he thinks would have happened with slavery in that scenario).

According to Marx the South's economy was

>export articles, cotton, tobacco, sugar, etc., carried on by slaves, ^^^4

and so was only profitable as long as

>it is conducted with large gangs of slaves, on a mass scale and on wide expanses of a naturally fertile soil, which requires only simple labor. Intensive cultivation, which depends less on fertility of the soil than on investment of capital, intelligence and energy of labor, is contrary to the nature of slavery ^^^4

Marx catergorically states his opinion on what the war was about here. As mentioned he does not see it as an abolitionist war, in that sense agreeing with some of the English voices arguing against supporting the North. But he goes on to make it clear that he thinks the South absolutely is fighting the war to preserve and expand slavery. And I feel it's clear he has a favourable view of the North in comparison to the South because of this

>The war has not been undertaken with a view to put down Slavery, and the United States authorities themselves have taken the greatest pains to protest against any such idea. But then, it ought to be remembered that it was not the North, but the South, which undertook this war; the former acting only on the defense. If it be true that the North, after long hesitations, and an exhibition of forbearance unknown in the annals of European history, drew at last the sword, not for crushing Slavery, but for saving the Union, the South, on its part, inaugurated the war by loudly proclaiming “the peculiar institution” as the only and main end of the rebellion. It confessed to fight for the liberty of enslaving other people, a liberty which, despite the Northern protests, it asserted to be put in danger by the victory of the Republican party and the election of Mr. Lincoln to the Presidential chair. The Confederate Congress boasted that its new-fangled constitution, as distinguished from the Constitution of the Washingtons, Jeffersons, and Adams’s, had recognized for the first time Slavery as a thing good in itself, a bulwark of civilization, and a divine institution. If the North professed to fight but for the Union, the South gloried in rebellion for the supremacy of Slavery. ^^^2

Elsewhere in the same article Marx says that the South's attitude to Missouri and Kentucky also show it cannot be just about state rights, otherwise the South would be protecting the rights of states to remain in the Union as readily as their right to secede.

**Class struggle and class.**

As for whether this mean he saw it as class struggle? Well from a Marxist point of view all society is the history of class struggles, so yes. The Marxist theory of history involves the idea that economic realities for a base that the superstructure of society is built on, conflicts between the interests of these classes are at the root of conflict and progress. In terms of what that means applied to the American Civil War Marx pretty much sums it up here

>The present struggle between the South and North is, therefore, nothing but a struggle between two social systems, the system of slavery and the system of free labour. The struggle has broken out because the two systems can no longer live peacefully side by side on the North American continent. It can only be ended by the victory of one system or the other. ^^^2

Note that ""free labour"" here is best understood in Marxist theory as a description in a specifically Marxist context, not necessairly as praise for the system. In *Das Kapital* (first published 1867) Marx describes the free labourer as

>Free labourers, in the double sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production, as in the case of slaves, bondsmen, &c., nor do the means of production belong to them, as in the case of peasant-proprietors; they are, therefore, free from, unencumbered by, any means of production of their own. [...] As soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale. The process, therefore, that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production; a process that transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production into capital, on the other, the immediate producers into wage labourers. "" ^^^3

So when Marx says it was a struggle between free labour and slavery, it can be understood as similar to saying a struggle between developing capitalism and an archaic economic system. However, as discussed, that did not mean the defeat of the South did not break slave owner power in the US.

We can see that not only did he disagree with arguments against the North but had quite a strong negative view of the entire approach to the debate. After essentially accusing several English publications of playing dumb about slavery he also notes that

>the staple of argument on the part of the anti-Northern papers is very scanty, and throughout all of them we find almost the same sentences recurring, like the formulas of a mathematical series, at certain intervals, with very little art of variation or combination. ^^^1

AskHistorians,"Many African American slaves, upon obtaining their freedom, took surnames such as “Washington,” “Jefferson,” and “Johnson.” Why wasn’t the name “Lincoln” commonly chosen?",[removed]
AskHistorians,"During the Apollo 15 mission, the crew placed the ""Fallen Astronaut"" statue and memorial on the Moon. What was the Soviet reaction to the inclusion of cosmonauts' names alongside their American peers?","I haven't been able to unearth any specific reaction to that plaque, but I do want to emphasize

1. there was a general Cold War thread of US-Soviet cooperation in space, especially starting in 1971.

2. both sides provided condolences whenever an astronaut or cosmonaut was fallen, even prior to this.

Space cooperation really started in a way right after the ""space race"" ended; Apollo 11 landed in July, and in September of 1969 a letter was sent from Administrator Paine of NASA expressing regret that Soviet-US cooperation had thus far been limited. A reply was sent in October 1970 by Academician Keldysh agreeing with this, and a meeting was arranged in January of 1971.

At the time Low was NASA's Acting Administrator (and Keldysh's equivalent counterpart), and he chose a small delegation who could discuss a large range of agreements; they also drafted beforehand what goals they were interested in. Once the meeting started he had not only proposed space agreements but a draft press release announcing the agreements.

This was right when diplomatic tension was heating up (there was a trial of two Soviet Jews sentenced to death for an alleged hijacking which the US claimed was trumped-up) but the meeting in Moscow went ahead anyway, with Kissinger giving the specific warning that if the Soviets were easy to talk to about space agreements that does not mean they were easy to talk about political ones. Specifically:

>As long as you stick to space, do anything you want to do. You are free to commit -- in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission.

The Keldysh-Low Agreement, as it was called, set a groundwork for further cooperation; the Soviet press presented it in a very neutral tone, just giving the facts, as again, diplomatic tensions were high, but at least among those in space things were clearly opening up.

Cosmotautics Day, April 12, had Keldysh discuss problems in space were getting more complicated, and that it was therefore

>...increasingly urgent to develop cooperation among scientists from various countries in the field of research into and exploration of outer space ... the first steps have been made toward such cooperation with the United States.

This was eventually followed by a more formal bilateral agreement in 1972 ...

>The Parties will encourage international efforts to resolve problems of international law in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes with the aim of strengthening the legal order in space and further developing international space law and will cooperate in this field.

... and this eventually paved the way for the Apollo-Soyuz mission of July 15, 1975, where three astronauts docked with the Soyuz in partnership with the two cosmonauts there.

So: mid-1971, despite whatever diplomatic tensions lingered, it was not strange at all for the US to mention Soviet achievements; partnership was already the new official space policy.

Even without that, even in the height of tensions, astronauts and cosmonauts honored each other in their sacrifices. When Komarov died on Soyuz 1 (1967), 47 American astronauts sent a telegram of condolences and James Webb (who ran NASA at the time) called for greater space cooperation. When the Soyuz 11 disaster happened, killing three cosmonauts (June 1971, a month before Apollo 15), the astronaut Tom Stafford flew to Moscow for the funeral as Nixon's envoy.

The Soviets returned the favor, especially when the Challenger disaster in 1986 happened. From Gorbachev to Reagan:

>We partake of your grief at the tragic death of the crew of the space shuttle Challenger. We express our condolences to the people of the United States and to the families of those who were killed in the accident.

From a joint message of the president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the chairman of the Intercosmos Council:

>The names of the victims will be inscribed in the history of space exploration.

The military dimension to the space programs has always muddled the waters, but in a real sense, all the astronauts were heroes generally, not to just their own countries. Yuri Gagarin is a good example: he went on tour after being the first man in space, and met with world leaders as if they were their equal. He met King Muhammad Zahir Shah in Afghanistan; he met Nehru and Indira Gandhi in India; in England, he met both with Prime Minister Macmillan and Queen Elizabeth; the Daily Mail had the headline ""Make Him Sir Yuri!"" He was given the Order of the African Star in Liberia.

When the infamous accident of the Apollo 13 mission happened, the desire to see the astronauts return safe was a worldwide phenomenon, with offers of aid from many countries including Russia. Pope Paul VI prayed at the Vatican; there were prayers at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Walter Cronkite said

>Perhaps never in human history has the entire world been so united by such a global drama.

Having love and support for fallen astronauts and cosmonauts thus was maintained as a continuous thread.

AskHistorians,"Why should I be ""glad Nixon isn't Slovenian"" as these campaign buttons claim I would be?","The pin message in question almost certainly came from a place with a large Slovene population.

The biggest center at the time was (and still is) Cleveland, Ohio (estimates are that Cleveland has over 80,000 Slovenes, the 
largest population outside Slovenia itself). This wasn't necessarily so from the beginning of immigration -- when Slovenians immigrated (the biggest influx was from
1880 to 1914 with labor looking for work), they went to places with mining and factories like Omaha, Nebraska and Pueblo, Colorado -- but Cleveland was also
included, especially for the Newburgh Steel Mill.

The steel mill became a center of gravity. The immigrant John Bradac came in 1890 and stayed
in the neighborhood of the mill for 57 years, opening two saloons and helping 800 other
Slovenians in getting citizenship. Other factories that opened were American Steel and Wire and Cleveland Rolling Mills. 
The steel plant had such a population of Slovenes that they had their own company band playing the music of the homeland. In 1919 Newburgh 
became the location of the Newburgh Slovenian National Home; it was expanded in 1949 with
bowling alleys (still in use) and a large ballroom.

This isn't a _guarantee_ that the button was from there -- Minnesota had (and has) a large population and additionally a popular Democrat,
in the US House of Representatives, John Blatnik, who was in office from 1947 all the way to 1974. Blatnik was
born to Slovene immigrant parents and during WWII worked with the OSS's division connected to the partisans of Yugoslavia. After
leaving office Blatnik was replaced by Jim Oberstar, a staff member with Blatnik for many years and another Democrat-Slovene, who 
lasted in the office until 2011.

Generally speaking, due to ""working class roots"", Slovenians leaned Democrat in the time of Nixon, only starting to
lean Republican with Ronald Reagan (not necessarily switching parties, but there were a fair number of ""Democrats for Reagan""
in 1980 -- Carter was just a turn-off for many and the economic woes in the country in general contributed to this). Not
every prominent Slovene politician was a Democrat, the most notable exception being George Voinovich, who attended Nixon's
inaguration and served in the Ohio House of Representatives (67-71) as Mayor of Cleveland (1980-1989) as Governor of Ohio
(1991-1998) and eventually US Senator (1999-2011). He was one of the top choices to pair with Bob Dole on the failed 1996
presidential ticket, and he is why we have a [picture of Bob Dole after dancing the polka](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/republican-presidential-hopeful-bob-dole-celebrates-after-news-photo/51978010).

For the meaning of the button it's simply: we're Slovenes, we're Democrats, and aren't you glad Nixon isn't Slovene? ... because that would be embarrassing and wrong.

AskHistorians,What did J.R.R. Tolkien think of later fantasy fiction?,"Unfortunately, we don't know much about what Tolkien thought of the fantasy genre; by the time the genre was really picking up steam (the late '60s, following the unauthorized American publication of Lord of the Rings in 1965) he had slowed down on writing and correspondence considerably, especially after an injury in 1968.

He wrote considerably about earlier fairy-stories, folktales, and even adventure stories by Haggard or Howard, but almost nothing about the later fantasy boom. [EDIT: I'm paraphrasing broadly here, and didn't want to mislead; he wrote considerably about fairy-stories, only somewhat about Haggard, who was certainly an influence, and very little about Howard (he was sent a collection including a Howard story in 1963 and didn't seem to like the collection as a whole). My intention was to show that he definitely had familiarity with *early* fantasy literature typified by Haggard and Howard, whereas he wrote essentially nothing about fantasy literature after the '60s.] The closest he got was a 1967 letter to Charlotte and Dennis Plimmer, providing feedback on their recent interview with him, where he mentions ""I read quite a lot – or more truly, try to read many books (notably so-called Science Fiction and Fantasy). But I seldom find any modern books that hold my attention."" 

He also includes a footnote: ""There are exceptions. I have read all that E. R. Eddison wrote, in spite of his peculiarly bad nomenclature and personal philosophy. I was greatly taken by the book that was (I believe) the runner-up when The L. R. was given the Fantasy Award: *Death of Grass.* I enjoy the S.F. of Isaac Azimov. Above these, I was recently deeply engaged in the books of Mary Renault; especially the two about Theseus, The King Must Die, and The Bull from the Sea. A few days ago I actually received a card of appreciation from her; perhaps the piece of 'Fan-mail' that gives me most pleasure.""

E. R. Eddison and Sam Youd's *Death of Grass* are both earlier fantasy novels than what you mean, and Mary Renault doesn't exactly fit the mold of fantasy fiction, writing stories about ancient Greece. So, it seems that while Tolkien attempted to keep abreast of the growing Sci-Fi and Fantasy trends, he didn't really find the books of the '60s as appealing as those of the '50s and before. (Though his appreciation of Asimov is notable; Asimov in turn was a huge Tolkien fan.) [EDIT: Given that this is a footnote referring to ""modern books,"" and all the books he cites are from the '50s or before, he may well have meant he tries to read ""modern"" fantasy as opposed to folklore, rather than reading *contemporary* fantasy being published in the late '60s. There's really no evidence Tolkien read any fantasy literature from the late '60s or beyond; I believe Dune is the latest book we know that Tolkien read at all.]

Moorcock, for his part, claims that he met Tolkien as a young man at Oxford and found him nice, although Moorcock *strongly* disliked Tolkien's writing and, despite the obvious influence, wrote his stories to consciously avoid Tolkien's ethics and worldview. It's also notable that in 1966 Tolkien wrote a letter to future sci-fi/fantasy legend Gene Wolfe, who at the time hadn't yet published anything; however, that letter is entirely about the etymology of the word ""warg.""

Overall, Tolkien seemed a little uncomfortable with the sort of popularity he gained in the late '60s: he was no fan of hippies, and his letters from 1968 onward regularly point out that he was in retirement, deliberately avoiding press, interviews, and scrutiny, and was quite upset when his address became known and he was ""assailed by hosts of people"" once more. [EDIT: In going through his letters, found a very indicative one to W. H. Auden about the foundation of a New York Tolkien Society in 1965, of which he said ""such
things fill me too with alarm and despondency."" However, he's fairly cordial in a letter to the president of the Tolkien Society of America a month later.]"

AskHistorians,Why are eyes and teeth not covered by insurance all across the world?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"Why did the US reprivatize railroads after World War 1, despite the vast majority of rail workers supporting keeping nationalization?","PART I

Because by that point there was little support outside rail worker unions for it along with devolving into a partisan issue that couldn't even muster continued support among its previously most enthusiastic backers.  This came partially from labor's own mistakes but also from the experience of the federal government running railroads, which had fixed one mess but created several more.

So let's go back a little bit to provide some context, since without it the events that took place between 1916 through 1920 make little sense.  Railroads and their immense impact during Reconstruction, the Gilded Age, and the beginning of the Progressive Era are a vastly complicated, top level topic that I'm not going to be addressing here save for a couple of points.  The first is that in many ways populism develops as a response to the stranglehold that railroads have on the infrastructure, political system, and overall economy in many areas of the country; even at a time where governmental action is more or less deliberately sidelined by both parties, the Interstate Commerce Commission still gets chartered in 1887.

The second is what follows over the course of the next three decades, which is a long, gradual decline of the profitability of an industry that largely refuses to adapt to the new, more regulated political environment that it is forced to comply with.  Even without the initial cooperation of the Supreme Court, eventually Congress starts taking an axe to the existing rate structure with legislation like the Hepburn and Elkins Acts.  In turn, the railroads continue to do things like overexpand, have debt ridden balance sheets thanks to takeovers and dividends, and never quite figure out business models that accept that at least in theory they're now supposed to compete on more than just setting whatever price they feel the market will bear based on where their track runs.

I've compressed decades of vigorous academic economic arguments here - some of which are still ongoing, and you can get into some pretty good stuff like cartel behavior if you take a dive into the many econ PhDs that have been written on the subject - but the two most relevant financial indicators of the health of the rail industry by the time 1916 rolls around are these.  First, between 1900 and 1915, compound inflation goes up about 30% over those 15 years, but the cost of running the rails rises 50% over that time.  Second, partially thanks to the ICC gaining some teeth and the public and politicians finally being able to get revenge after two generations of gouging, freight rates per ton stay flat thanks to minimal rate increases permitted by regulators.  To make matters even worse on the revenue front, in the other part of their business, passenger revenue per mile outright declines by about 20% between 1890 and 1910.

Declining gross margins and rising costs are generally a recipe for disaster for any company.  Translating this financial analysis terminology into that suitable for public history, the net effect of all this is that the profitability of railroads basically goes kablooey over that time period.

Two things happen as a result.  First, by 1915 about a sixth of the rail network (~40k miles of about 240k total) of the United States is either bankrupt or in receivership.  Second, even the rails that are in better health have over the decades massively skimped on CapEx, capital expenditures.  This presents a major problem as while railway economics improve dramatically in 1916 - freight miles carried go up by a remarkable 1/3rd year-over-year thanks to the war boom supplying the Allies - the infrastructure to deal with it is either antiquated, insufficient, or at times non-existent.   By November 1916 the industry was short over 100,000 rail cars even if it had been run efficiently, which it wasn't, and that structural deficit is exacerbated by a lack of enough locomotives to haul the ones they have.  Another issue becomes that given the years of insufficient building of terminal facilities, full trains would stack up at them waiting for unloading and sit for weeks or even months; close to 150,000 fully loaded rail cars or so were essentially stuck  by the end of the year.  Making it even more dire, even once unloaded, railroads frequently refused to make a run with empty freight cars back to their origination or wherever else they were needed; instead, they'd wait around for a cargo run for revenue before departing.  

And then on top of this, thanks to the freight boom in 1916 labor realizes it can get away with playing hardball.

While the images of management running roughshod over labor in that era come to mind with images of coal miners and factory workers working in hellish conditions, the rail worker brotherhoods involved in this - engineers, firemen, conductors, and trainmen - are actually some of the best paid labor in the country, with the most comparable modern equivalency likely being something like today's airline pilot unions.  They rather cleverly hatch on to something that's been demanded by all rail workers (and most of labor in general) for years, which is an eight hour workday.

This sounds quite reasonable on the surface, but given railroads tended to operate on ten hour shifts that couldn't easily be altered, what this proposal actually was asking for is a pretty substantial pay raise with overtime being routinely paid out after the first 8 hour shift.  Railroad management isn't acting in any better faith as many just want to outright break the unions entirely.  A strike is set for September 4th, 1916.

Wilson is very concerned given the disaster such an action would have on the economy, let alone on supplying the Allies; he first assigns his Secretary of Labor to mediate in early August.  That fails, so Wilson then steps in himself, bringing the two sides in separately over a week later that month, and proposes a compromise of an eight hour day without overtime; management rejects it outright, to which Wilson responds in biting fury as they leave the White House on August 21st, ""I pray God to forgive you, (as) I never can.""

Wilson then takes the extraordinary step of addressing Congress in a hastily called Joint Session and asking it to take action to avert the strike.  In a rush, it passes the Adamson Act - named after William C. Adamson of Georgia, chair of the House Interstate Commerce Committee and fairly close confidant of Wilson (the following March, he's only one of two men that Wilson is known to open up to about the internal debate roiling him about asking Congress to go to war) - which starts overtime at 8 hours and puts an absolute cap at a 16 hour workday.  Labor wins round one.

Except even in a substantial victory (239-56 in the House, 43-28 in the Senate) there are warning signs.  When it reaches the Senate, the vote is mostly along party lines with even Progressive Republicans like Norris and Borah opposing it, and regular ones denouncing it as ""class legislation and a craven surrender to union threats.""  Moreover, even on introduction it's considered controversial enough so that one of the additional powers Wilson asks for in the original draft of the bill - in the event of military necessity, to grant him the authority to take over and run the railroads - instead gets placed in a less contentious bill that gets passed around the same time, the Army Appropriations Act of 1916.

The provisions of the latter bill don't receive much if any discussion on the Presidential campaign trail, but the Adamson Act sure does.  Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes tells William Howard Taft that passing it was a ""most shameful proceeding"" and that it should be made ""a fundamental issue. I propose to press it constantly."" He indeed does so as the single biggest domestic campaign issue of the 1916 race, calling Democrats out for special interest and class legislation.  Teddy Roosevelt weighs in too, claiming it represents ""the policy of craven surrender to whichever side has the superiority of brute force"" and Wilson having ""frank cynicism of belief in, and appeal to, what is basest in the human heart.""  

This also convinces big business to donate far more heavily to Hughes than they did to Taft, along with making an effort to get out the vote; one supporter tells a Wilson aide, ""Before they were lukewarm, but now they are fighting mad and are offering their support to Hughes in both money and effort.""  While the upside of this for Democrats is that it seals in the realignment of much of the labor movement to their party for 1916 and may have swung several states in the largely populist West, it is viewed as one reason why elsewhere Hughes closes the race substantially between the end of August and Election Day, with only an unintended snub of California's Hiram Johnson probably costing him the state and the election.

Then comes round two.  Instead of paying the now mandated overtime, railroad management claims that the Adamson Act is unconstitutional and litigates it.  Union leaders respond by calling for yet another crippling strike set for March 19, 1917; if the 1916 strike would have been a disaster, by this point it's even worse as the United States is teetering on the very edge of declaring war. On the morning the strike is scheduled, management caves in and agrees to overtime after 8 hours - and conveniently, the Supreme Court rules later that afternoon in a 5-4 decision of *Wilson v. New* that Congress had not exceeded its authority and the Adamson Act was indeed legal, so they should have been doing so all along.

All this is obviously rather fresh on the minds of all when the United States enters the war a little over two weeks later, which since I'm pushing 10000 characters anyway here seems like it's a good place to end Part I."
AskHistorians,"In ""Cunk on Earth"", Egyptologist Tyledesly says ""I don't think they had many homeless people in ancient Egypt. People looked after each other, I think."" Did ancient Egypt (or other ancient societies) not experience homelessness as we know it today?","Hey /u/Wombfresh, this is a great question! Amusingly, I also just finished watching the Cunk on Earth series so this question feels doubly timely. I would agree that poverty and homelessness in Ancient Egypt were certainly *different* than how they are experienced presently in North American cities, but that doesn't mean they didn't exist.

Several years ago /u/XenophonTheAthenian answered a [similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/67jm3s/were_there_homeless_people_in_ancient_rome/dgr393a/) about Ancient Rome and I think some of that insight holds true here:

> The deal is that the vast majority of urban inhabitants were unskilled day-workers who lived a hand-to-mouth existence scrounging up whatever work they could. They survived by working on monumental building projects, at the Tiber dockyards, in the construction of roads and other manual labor, in minor unskilled suburban agricultural work, and in hawking. Their wages (provided they found work that day) were poor and paid daily. Harrison and others have pointed out that since rents were often paid daily and work was not always available in any given region of the city much of the city's population was probably essentially migratory, moving around in the city as working conditions changed. [...] Beggars, which we might consider the most abject of the poor, were habitually itinerant or homeless.

In the specific context of Ancient Egypt, Delphine Driaux recently published an article called ""Toward a Study of the Poor and Poverty in Ancient Egypt: Preliminary Thoughts"" which offers a nice overview of the topic. Driaux notes that poverty and homelessness remain much less studied topics in Egyptology than the life of the upper classes, but through an examination of textual, iconographic, and funerary evidence they are able to draw some preliminary conclusions.

Through a textual analysis of *The Satire of the Trades* Driaux begins to construct an image of one Ancient Egyptian view of the ""poor."" In the text a man named Khety encourages his son to become a scribe, while presenting the harsh realities of manual labour:

> Nevertheless, although the text shows some condescension towards ordinary people, at no point is a term for ‘poor’ mentioned. That does not mean, however, that such workers were not considered part of the poor, since this text is dealing with the personal perceptions of a member of the dominant class, for whom undertaking manual labour alone is clearly a sufficient sign of a lower social condition. Khety also provides a detailed description of the external appearance and the physical condition of such labourers (the potter’s clothes are stiff with mud, the arms of the wall-builder are covered with earth, the gardener has a festering, swollen neck, etc.) to his son in order to persuade him to become a scribe, giving insight into what Egyptians thought were signs of deprivation. By explaining the negative aspects of these trades, Khety is presumably presenting here an Egyptian opinion on what is ‘poor’. (3)

Driaux then turns to the portrayal of labourers in iconography of the period. Extant images of labourers often portray them as balding, hairy, hunchbacked, unkempt, etc. Eventually, Driaux draws the conclusion that these iconographic portrayals: 

> have a sociological importance that implies a value judgement, which is rather negative. Perceived as being ‘different’ from the elites, these ordinary people are associated with negative or undesirable characteristics that can be turned easily into caricatures or stereotypes. (4)

But were these people - or at least some of them - homeless? It's very hard to say, though Driaux argues in favour of a so-called ""archaeology of poverty"" wherein members of the lower classes would live in simply constructed dwellings, which were often attached to larger buildings and under the auspices of a member of society higher up the social ladder. Using the sculptor Thutmose's workshop as an example, Driaux states that there were small brick dwellings built onto the back of his workshop's property that would have likely housed the labourers who aided him. These dwellings were organized around a large open space with a well in the centre. These men were the responsibility of Thutmose who was also responsible for providing them with food from his granaries. All of this combined leads Driaux to draw the conclusion that: ""Poverty appears then as a social construction. It is indeed precisely by considering these individuals as inferior and different that the elites can categorize them as being poor and, as soon as this categorization is established, they can start to treat them as such."" (12)

Driaux's ultimate conclusion is that the vast majority of the populace in Ancient Egypt lived in a state of ""integrated poverty"" (this includes tradespeople, labourers, the 10 men who assisted Thustmose, etc). Driaux is careful to note, however, that some words seem to indicate a *different* kind of poverty:

> Nevertheless, it appears that some words (like *ḳrj*) cover the idea of a ‘marginal poverty’ that takes in a very small portion of the population who probably lived on the fringes of the society. Another group or degree of poverty that one can describe as ‘integrated poverty’, more visible in the funerary iconography, consists of the vast majority of the ancient Egyptian society—the peasants, manual workers, etc. The many aspects of poverty of these individuals can be due to the precariousness of their social status, their lack of material resources, but also the privation of power or influence, professional skills, knowledge or even physical capacities. Amongst the mass of poor, one must therefore take a nuanced understanding, based not only on social status, but also on criteria which differentiate the groups of poor within society. (14)

So, was there homelessness in Ancient Egypt? Almost certainly. As with Ancient Rome, however, it seems that the majority of those in something akin to poverty would have been living in ""integrated poverty"" but when housing and food are tied so strictly to the whims of a member of the elite there was almost certainly iterant homelessness between jobs, while looking for work, etc. even if that was not the norm.

AskHistorians,"All things considered, was Gaddafi in fact the tyrannical dictator type the west made him out to be?","On the one hand, you could make the point that he redistributed the wealth of Libya's economic oil boom to the citizenry, as well as oversaw works like the 'Man-Made River Project' which helped bring water to the arid North. He seized power in a bloodless revolution, which is rare. And he stood firmly in the face of mega corporations exploiting Libya's oil reserves, not only turning the tables back in favor of his country, but setting a precedent throughout Northern Africa and the middle East. He also wrote his 'Green Book': a denunciation of both capitalism and communism's inherent flaws and hypocrisies. He proposed a third wave; one that promised to give power to the people and reform the cruelty and exploitation of globalization in economics and politics. But that would be a narrow view that ignores his own hypocrisy and crimes. 

Looking at *The Green Book*, [BBC said this in their writeup of his legacy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12688033):

>*In fact, it is little more than a series of fatuous diatribes, and it is bitterly ironic that a text whose professed objective is to break the shackles imposed by the vested interests dominating political systems was used instead to subjugate an entire population.*

Perhaps that's western bias. But the reality is that he earned his reputation as an autocrat, quashing dissidents swiftly. Some would point out his leniency (relative), in that he'd often exile dissenters for a set period of time with no threat of imprisonment or punishment when the de-facto sentence was up and they returned. While that is certainly preferable to being hanged for going against say, the Ayatollah, there can be no question that it was an authoritarian regime uninterested in giving power to its people. The power dynamic that feigned republican checks and balances did little other than put window dressing on centralized oversight. 

Gaddafi also oversaw intervention in the Chad civil war, backing FROLINAT rebels and insurgents among other African interventions. By 1980, 9 different African nations had called out Libya for interfering in their affairs (with military action) and cut their diplomatic relationships. In something of a curious ""partnership"", Gaddafi signed a treaty with Moroccan leader Hassan II, despite diametrically opposed views on Islam and the West. The relationship was short-lived, and would be hard to view as not being put on by ulterior motives from the beginning. 

There can be no debate about both the west and the Soviet's antagonistic actions throughout the Cold War. Without condoning or condemning, the facts are that in the early 80s Reagan ordered military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte. Libyan jets punched out on an intercept course, facetiously claiming that the US was operating within its airspace and nautical boundaries. The U.S. shot two SU-22s down and tension built. 

In 1984, whatever leniency he'd promised was shown to be reneged upon at best, and a lie at worst. He had his forces execute Al-Sadek Hamed Al-Shuwehdy on state television in a stadium for joining anti-government campaigns. What's noteworthy to the west is that Al-Sadek was an engineering student studying in the U.S. on a visa. The implications were grim.

Moving into 1986, the U.S. accused Gaddafi, or at least his Libyan loyalists, of being behind the Berlin discotheque bombing. An oil embargo was enforced, and then Reagan pushed for military intervention. In a brief bombing campaign, Libyan civilians were killed. This painted the US in a bad light on the world stage, and boosted Gaddafi's profile. It's not unrealistic to think that outside of the US, this might help garner sympathy for him. 

However, Gaddafi refused to release two Libyan suspected of bombing a ~~Scottish~~ flight *over Scotland* in '88. The UN, British Parliament, and US all took very strong stances against the nation and its leader for this. Over 270 people were killed in the attack, and his complacence in sheltering the suspects is nearly impossible to paint in a favorable light. ^(EDIT: he did finally release the two in 1999, and the flight was US-bound.) 

Now then, let's fast forward a bit. Because it was the George W Bush administration that really revitalized his profile in the west. We know what we know about the war in Iraq, and I won't get into the weeds of these implications for the US. But what this newfound diplomacy with Bush, Tony Blair, and US oil interests did do was vilify Gaddafi to his Arab neighbors. For a man who had come to power on principles of overthrowing global power dynamics, it was...curious to make bedfellows of the leaders of a campaign most of the world saw as an opportunistic imperialist march. At the same time, Gaddafi was making friends with China, hosting president Zemin in 2002. 

At this time, he also announced Libya's previously-unacknowledged nuclear program and promised to decommission it, presumably to gain favor and protection from the west. The admittance of having pursued large-scale nuclear weapons whilst being embroiled in numerous nations' conflicts posed serious questions about the intentions and trustworthiness of Gaddafi and his regime. 

Now then, the last part is hard. Because it's the most damning in answering your question. But the events don't meet the 20 year rule. I'm hoping that by providing enough backdrop prior, and discussing your question at length before that barrier, this is admissible. 

Arab Spring came, and moreover, it carried well into Africa. Wahhabism, Salafism, and a wave of dissention amongst various peoples of Islamic nations followed. Libya was not spared, and what amounted to a civil war broke out. This is perhaps Gaddafi's biggest claim to tyranny comes from. And I'd say deservedly so. The protests turned to ~~genocide~~ and a civil war in 2011 once security forces began firing live rounds at protestors. Over 500 civilians were killed in the first ten days of the uprising. [In May, the government laid seige to Misrata.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/18/muammar-gaddafi-war-crimes-files) 

>*One document shows the commanding general of government forces instructing his units to starve Misrata's population during the four-month siege. The order, from Youssef Ahmed Basheer Abu Hajar, states bluntly: ""It is absolutely forbidden for supply cars, fuel and other services to enter the city of Misrata from all gates and checkpoints."" Another document instructs army units to hunt down wounded rebel fighters, in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions.*

In the end, Gaddafi was captured and killed by his own people. Although NATO forces helped the rebel forces, it would be hard not to argue how large and popular the uprising was amongst Libyans. I would argue that that fact speaks volumes as to his dictatorship."
AskHistorians,Is my union rep right to say that most of the labour rights currently enjoyed in the UK are the result of trade union action or influence?,"Let's have a crack at this. This is a pretty big question. I could give you a simple yes/no answer, but instead I'm going to drag this wide open and write a bunch of words.

Let me start of by saying that as a political statement, he's right. What he's saying is perfectly defensible, there's been a lot written about this, it's not a wild statement at all. 

However, historically speaking, there's more to say. 

First of, let me start by saying: historians are perfectly qualified to answer this question. I saw another comment suggest that this was more of a political question, but let's be clear: politics don't just stop existing after 20 years when they turn into history. If you look at the current political and societal landscape, can you imagine historians in 2043 looking back and picking the ""correct"" version of how things transpired? What *is* the correct version, anyway? The interests of various societal groups are often opposed - and will produce an incredibly different perception of events. Can you say that any one of those perceptions is ""more true"" than the other? More preferable or the story we want to tell, maybe, but that's politics. 

The work of a historian is inherently political and any historian trying to tell you different is either lying or an idiot. We're lucky to be past the days of positivism when historians insisted that history is just a science and that by just applying the proper method, we could come to a universal, scientific truth. However, descendants of this strain of historiography still haven't given up and while acknowledging the personal bias of every historian, they'll insist that being aware of these biases is enough to negate them. Which is, frankly, baloney. You can never see all your biases and acknowledging the ones you can see doesn't negate them. In essence, every historical work is a political work and it's important to acknowledge this. 

That said, let's go to your union rep's statement. The core of what he's getting at, is the question how we enact change and how politics work. 

Let's start with the orthodox version of how this works. I say orthodox because it's the version we still find in school books, it's the version that most people still use as their framework in engaging with politics (in ""the West"", at the very least). That version originates in classical political liberalism and is focussed intensely on *rights*, and inevitably limits itself to the places where those rights are enshrined - parliaments, courts, what you're probably imagining when you think about the word ""politics"". Your labour rights were enshrined by politicians, who did so maybe as part of a political deal, or maybe after gaining a majority in parliament after a very spirited campaign. It's the standard way we learn about history in many parts of the world, and why you'll be spending more time memorising your country's prime ministers or presidents than going into the social movements from your country's past. The social movements will get mentioned, sure, but the focus is on the actors of state and high politics. (There are exceptions to this - the US Civil Rights movement being an example... in some textbooks, at least)
It also often tends towards Great Man Theory. I remember reading in my middle school textbook about how lovable capitalist Henry Ford decided to grant his workers higher wages because he figured it'd lead to them buying more cars. That was such a great idea that all capitalists adopted that idea as well. 

This is the idealist version of change. It's an attractive idea. Believing in something is enough to change the world. You just have to be right and convince enough people to agree with you.

Now, opposed to this is the materialist version of change, the one your union rep is referring to. This takes a broader look at how change is achieved and leaves the walls of parliament behind it. Change is possible through the mobilisation of people in social movements. Either getting the masses out on the streets, or having the capacity to get them out and having the threat of this be enough. This goes beyond just ""being right"". Being right is often not enough. The material conditions have to be right - economically, politically, organisationally. When you take this lens and look at the labour history of your country, you'll see that before that moment a certain right gets enshrined into law, there's been years of labour struggle preceding it and directly leading to it. Let's look at some concrete examples. I'll mainly use the history of my own country, Belgium, because I'm more familiar with it. 

Let's go with democracy. There's a lot to be said about when Belgium became a democracy. Although casual histories will refer to 1830s Belgium as a democracy, the right to vote was limited to the rich and the powerful. Women would only get the vote in 1948. A big step towards democracy came in 1893, when the system of plural voting (meaning votes were weighed and weren't equal) for men was introduced. This was *the* demand of the Belgian labour movement at the time - who saw entry into parliamentary politics as the way forward - and one of their first major victories. 

For fun, let's look at how Wikipedia describes it: ""Plural voting was enacted in Belgium in 1893 by Auguste Beernaert (prime minister for the Catholic party) after a general strike and as a response to the demands of the Belgian Labour Party, with support of social-progressive liberals, as part of a proposal by MPs Albert Nyssens (Catholic Party) and Émile Féron (liberal party)"" Notice how the focus of this description is a combination of Great Man Theory and parliamentary politics, with the general strike being wedged in as an aside. In reality, none of the men mentioned nor their parties wanted any form of extension of franchise. Enacting Plural Voting led to the marginalisation of the Liberal Party and to the immediate election of 28 socialist MPs - which the Catholic Party absolutely abhorred. Both parties were the parties of the (haute) bourgeoisie (nobody else could vote) and were acutely aware that this would end up costing them economically. 

So why did they do it? Well, that's that general strike the article vaguely mentions. In reality, there'd been strike waves all over Belgium for the past decade and they'd been getting more and more militant and were met with heavy repression. These strikes shut the country down and threatened the existing social order - as repression grew and deaths mounted, the demands became more militant. Concessions had to be made and were made, to avoid losing control of the situation. And that's exactly what happened. Now, it may have been Auguste Beernaert who signed Plural Voting into law, it was the mobilisation of the masses leading up to it that put that pen into his hand."
AskHistorians,"The Titanic carried some of the wealthiest people in the world. What impact (if any) did their deaths have on global economics, politics, and culture?","I've been mulling this one over for a few days, trying to figure out how best to answer it.. Believe it or not, it's not *totally* in my purview. I can certainly tell you some of the immediate aftermath of the sinking, and I can certainly cite you first hand sources but I can't say I know enough about global economics, politics, and culture in 1912 to give a decent answer on how they were affected by the sinking. I'll be able to speculate andto make somewhat educated guesses, and then I'll give you suggestions to hand it off to those in other areas of expertise.  I think the best way to begin to answer your question is to use this response as a launching point. I'll be able to give you a map, but not qualified to lead you through the woods, so to speak? Hopefully the mods will allow this. :)

Let's start with culture, as that one is easiest to track. Western society  was devastated by the sinking, and the public demand for information often turned violent. The cultural output of grief -  everything from music, to poems, to songs, to plays, to movies, etc etc lasted strongly until the war. While eastern countries were not as grief-stricken, Titanic still made major, headline, news around the world.

A good resource for who and what the public was demanding is the newspapers from the early morning of April 15th  (when news began to break that there had been an incident) until Carpathia steamed in to New York on the 18th. Some observations.

The Astor's dominated almost every paper and every headline, not just John Jacob and Madeleine, but his son and family in New York waiting for news. The Strauss's had similar coverage. Guggenheim was mostly news in New York.  Other big names would pop up as news came in, but many were heavily featured locally. Archibald Butt, Clarence Moore, and Frank Millet were the main focus of the Washington Papers- who also covered on the Thayer's from nearby Philadelphia. Washington Dodge and family were closely followed by their local San Francisco papers. The Wideners were mentioned a bit but, oddly, Mrs. Widener was *far* more reported in her post-sinking years than in 1912. WT Stead understandable made international headlines

Some interesting findings as I look through newspaper archives. Karl Behr, tennis star, was mainly focused in smaller papers. Rene Harris, widow of Broadway producer Henry Harris, was major news but movie star Dorothy Gibson was not - her story being relegated to minor movie magazines and tabloids. Writer Helen Candee was mentioned in some of the same headlines as her fellow Washington-ians. The Carter's were big news in their hometown of Elizabeth, NJ. Sculptor Paul Chèvre had two articles about him, one of which he denounced as pure fabrication. Socialites the Duff-Gordon's were reported dead, but became much more popular because of their testimony and the rumors of their conduct in the lifeboats. 

We could go on, but *in general* we start to see what mattered to the people buying the newspapers - businessmen, famous families, and politicians. Sculptor's, writers, various artists got some mention, the movie star got almost none. Rene Harris's husband dominated Broadway so naturally she made news in New York. 

Now, we are talking about a very specific time of booming economy, a world fueled by industry and business, yet still holding on to the old family names. These titans of Industry were known by name, in a way which we don't *really* have today. The people wanted news of them, and that's what was provided. I don't know enough about British or American culture in 1912, outside of Titanic. I'm not sure exactly what lead to this public fascination or when and why it died off (many of these people died in humble circumstances and couldn't get anyone to interview them or publish their accounts). I can guess that movies were not yet a cultural corner stone, especially considering Dorothy Gibson was a relatively major star in her day, but the stories of wealthy industrialists were. These papers show us who was culturally significant, how that changed is another topic.

Following this thread, the headliners can give us leads to follow on the economic and political consequences of the sinking. Vincent Astor, 20 years old, was followed closely by the papers as he waited for news of his father. Upon confirmation of John Jacob's death, he suddenly became one of the richest men in the world. He dropped out of Harvard, and dedicated his life to charity and philanthropy. He took the Astor fortune and rebuilt poor and lower income housing, using his real estate holding to convert property, most notably for immigrants and artists. He even took losses in order to build this housing in popular and scenic areas of the city. Eventually he established the Vincent Astor foundation, whose stated goal was  ""the alleviation of human misery"". Much of New York City today, cultural institutions and neighborhoods, are thanks to Vincent Astor.

Benjamin Guggenheim had two daughters, one of whom came of age, took her inheritance and moved to France to become a writer and artist, eventually meeting Emma Goldman and financially supporting her while she wrote. An art lover, she was an early promotor of Jackson Pollock and also took her fathers money to fund The Guggenheim Museum. Her sister, Barbara, was much more low-key but did release a record in the late 60's - ""Titanic Lifeboat Blues"".

Renee Harris became the first female manager and producer on Broadway, as well as a director and theatre owner. By her death, she was living in a one bedroom apartment having retired from a WPA job. Her husbands money was used to build and support the arts in New York, including the Actors Fund.

Archibald Butt was close to both Teddy Roosevelt and Howard Taft, the latter being devastated at his death. His death and subsequent inheritance of his private letters have given us a close look at the early days of the 1912 election. 

The Widener family took the inheritance and memory of George and Harry Widener and used it for education and philanthropy. The money built features of many campuses, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard. It also helped establish the Widener Foundation for the Handicapped, and later-  bought the famous LOVE statue in New York.

While the Straus's are mainly known for the foundation of Macy's, Isidor was also a congressman. His elder son, Jesse became ambassador to France in the years leading up to the war. He and his brothers took over their fathers share of Macy's, and built it into the world-wide retail giant we know today.

There's more of this of course, because Titanic truly was unique in how many major players of the early 20th century died on her, and how that sudden inheritance influenced this burgeoning super power that was the United States. It's really hard to be factual when we are talking about what is essentially the butterfly effect, but I think the argument could be made that without the death of Astor, New York City and it's cultural institutions would look very different today. Guggenheim's death fueled both the career of a famous anarchist, artist,  and the foundation of a major artistic world hub. The sons of Straus combined their power to build the National Retail Association. Macy's is now a global brand, something that might not have happened had Isidor lived and his sons not been forced to take over when they did.

But, from this, we can also see threads of where to start looking for more influence. How did Archibald Butt give us an insight into the election of 1912? Did his death have any affect on Taft's failure? What was the relationship between Roosevelt and France in the years leading up to the second world war, and how did Ambassador Straus influence that? Pennsylvania Railroad was slowly taking over the transportation on the east coast, with John Thayer being in charge of the Philadelphia/ New York lines. How did his death affect that? What literary preservations do we have thanks to the founding of the Widener Library at Harvard? These are all open ended questions, answers which are rooted in the sinking.

Lastly, let's consider those who should have been on Titanic but were not. How different would our world be today if JP Morgan had taken the voyage he was supposed to be on? What if Alfred Vanderbilt had decided to take Titanic as planned (even though he died 3 years later on Lusitania)?. How would American culture be different if Milton Hershey had used his stateroom booking? There's no academic answer to this, just ""what-ifs"".

And what better way to consider what could or could not have been than sitting back and listening to Barbara H. Guggenheim warbling through the ""Titanic: Lifeboat Blues"". [Enjoy :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAomkg0iM8o)"
AskHistorians,"I’ve often heard from political conservatives that early settlers at Jamestown & Plymouth nearly starved to death because they initially attempted “socialism”/collective farming, & that they only survived because they began using “capitalism” & privatized farmland. Is this in anyway true?","This question has a fundamentally anachronistic framework that skews the ability to answer it with any sense of historicity. The idea that the Jamestown and Plymouth settlers had any sense of either political ideology deployed in this line of argumentation is blatantly false. These are seventeenth century people looking to set up some kind of agrarian settlement in unfamiliar territory; not contemporary Western voters of the information age versed even superficially in the internal debates of political economy (it wasn't even a full fledged discipline at the time).   


To answer meat of the question, I will adopt the implicit premises of your question and use socialism to denote collective ownership characteristics, and capitalism to denote private ownership characteristics. I am not endorsing these oversimplified definitions, but will use them as placeholders for the purposes of getting through your query as framed. 

Jamestown was first founded by the Virginia Company of London (VCL or London Company) in 1607 as James Fort. It was briefly abandoned in 1610 due to typical challenges posed by early settlement in North America, but effectively became the colonial capital for the VCL by 1616. Property and resource ownership in the legal sense were administered via the charter of the VCL which was a legal compact between the VCL, the British Crown and its investors. The land that the company would use to extract resources, the resource outputs and even the indentured workers who worked it were all on the private property spectrum as far as economic polemics were concerned. The duty of the company was to pay a portion of its profits to investors, much like the way a dividend stock works today. As far as legality was concerned, this was a private enterprise and run as such. It owned land and wanted to extract its resources. Land was paid out to workers who survived their contracts, effectively making the land an asset, further adding capitalist flavour to the endeavour. By 1619, we see the arrival of slaves to contribute to the labour force being put to work on the most profitable land owned by investors. To frame any period of this history as socialist is laughable. This is a privately run industry with the main decisionmaking made by individuals in the employ of a stock company. It is not a comune in any sense. Jamestown was run by a business for business purposes and evolved as a settlement from those roots. 

Plymouth has similar roots. The difference here is that the Puritans who founded the colony did so to repay a debt instead of turn a profit at the outset. It is also arguable that the motivations here were different since the Puritans were indeed fleeing religious persecution at the hands of Tobias Matthew. However, the core economic mechanics of this endeavour were also characteristically capitalist in the sense that this enterprise was run on private property principles. The Puritan congregation purchased a patent from the Plymouth Company which was the same sort of institution as the VCL: a private charter company funded by stock investors. To earn the patent, the Puritans obtained financing from a group known as the Merchant Adventurers which is best described as an investors guild. To repay that financing, it was expected that Plymouth become a profitable colony in a similar way to all other charter colonial charter companies of the period. Since this was financed rather than explicitly founded by a company, the Puritans had a little more wiggle room in terms of how they organized their settlement. They were led by a system of governorship that was not overtly tied to company choice and were capable of codifying their own laws using a blend of English common law and the Bible. It is difficult to gauge how economic life was organized in the early years of the colony, but by 1627 we see the emergence of grazing rights and property boundaries highlighting the division of Plymouth settlement lands into private (i.e., capitalist) property lots forming the basis of a firmly capitalist oriented community where private property is the base (some historians argue this correlates the arrival of cattle and other livestock that relies on grazing). The fur trade was initially the most profitable export the colony had to repay its debt to the Adventurers. Agriculture and fishing provided a local trade network with other colonial settlements and Indigenous communities which arguably helped support other settlements within the regional network, Jamestown included. Commerce being capitalism's close family member helped ensure the viability of the venture and reinforced the private property dynamics that were taking root.   


The point here is that at no point in these stories is there any ever 'socialist' or collective ownership intentions in either of these endeavours. Jamestown was  a 'company colony' and run with profiteering in mind. Plymouth needed to be profitable by circumstance to pay down a debt owed to a company that made the endeavour possible. Private property and finance were integral to the development of these settlements, and any sense that these were collective ownership endeavours is fundamentally flawed on that basis alone. It is important to note that the early years of both these settlements suffers from a documentary gap, so while the possibility of collective ownership as mitigation strategies is possible, this would still ignore the capitalist core of these colonial projects.

AskHistorians,Is there any historical context for secret doors made out of bookshelves opening with a movement of a single book as seen in movies? Was this a thing? Any famous historical examples?,"The actual mechanism of pulling out a specific single book to open the secret door does seem to be a cinematic invention, but secret bookshelf doors - also called 'jib doors', when they are flush with the wall or other shelves surrounding them and so are ‘invisible’ - were definitely a thing!

Secret/hidden doors in general have a much longer history, but a bookshelf door in particular is referenced as existing as early as the mid-18th century, in Fetternear Palace in Aberdeen, Scotland. The door is described as being ""situated in the wall behind a large bookcase with a glazed front, a fixture in the room, the back of which could be made to slide back and give admittance to the recess."" It's not clear exactly how or from where the door was opened. There is also reference to a room behind a bookshelf at Stonyhurst Manor in England in the same time period, with the door specifically noted as ""having a secret spring,"" but again the exact mechanism of the door (such as whether this trigger for this spring was located in the bookshelf or elsewhere) is unclear. Charles Dickens had doors disguised as bookshelves built into two of his houses, at Tavistock Square and Gad's Hill, in the 1850s and 60s. The Grolier Club in New York, built in 1918, has a [particularly lovely one](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/arts/18grolier-club13/merlin_149119581_41630c7c-f756-4f3a-9d16-4fe01be62d2b-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp). In a more contemporary example, the Pixar offices have their own lounge hidden behind a bookshelf door that's opened by a switch hidden in a bust of Shakespeare sitting in front!

The bookcase concealing the entrance to the annex where Anne Frank and her family hid is another famous example of a bookcase door, although slightly different to the above as it is not flush with the wall or other bookcases around it (so not a jib door). It looks just like a separate bookcase against the wall.

Sliding bookcase doors occurred later, especially in the early 20th century - Bredlau Castle in Lake Elisnore, California, was built in the 1920s and had a secret room hidden behind a sliding bookcase used during Prohibition, as did a number of Prohibition-era speakeasies.

One particular historic type of secret door that's still possible to see today and took a number of forms are 'priest holes', or hiding places for Catholic priests, mostly built in the second half of the 16th century in the UK. Catholics were persecuted under the law during this time, and many houses belonging to Catholic families were fitted with hiding spaces so that a priest's presence (both the man himself and any religious accessories) could be concealed during searches. [Harvington Hall](https://www.harvingtonhall.co.uk/gallery/Galleries/Priest-Hides/529) is a great example - it has hiding spaces built behind a fake fireplace, and underneath a staircase that was accessed by tilting one of the steps, amongst others. Partingdale House had a secret staircase with a door designed to look like a decorative pilaster, depicted on the right in [this sketch](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/13918/images/fig076.jpg). It's possible bookcases would also have been used to conceal priest holes, pre-dating the Fetternear Palace reference, but I haven't found specific examples of this.

EDIT: I did a bit more searching (because I too am kind of obsessed with secret bookcase doors, I blame the 1991 version of The Addams Family), and Ingatestone Hall in Essex, completed in 1556, has a [priest hole](https://i0.wp.com/littlemissedenrose.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/file-cfde56df-7e7a-4007-9169-b35d9039ed64-10565-0000108a08f85fd4.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1) hidden behind a bookcase! This photo shows the reconstructed study, rebuilt in the 1920s/30s to replicate the Hall's original features after its interiors had been changed in the Georgian era. Both the Historic England listing for Ingatestone and 'Memory and the English Reformation' (2013) suggests that the old study also concealed the priest hole in the same way. So the concept of bookcase doors concealing hiding places is seemingly nearly 600 years old, at least.

EDIT 2: clarified the info on the Anne Frank house door as I was incorrect about it being a sliding door!

AskHistorians,"The popular book ""On Killing"" makes the case that most people mentally resist killing others, even in combat, and would rather shoot wide. What does historical research say? is there evidence for or against soldiers in war resisting killing the enemy?","/u/King_of_men linked to an old answer of mine (much appreciated!) it is almost a decade old and I've revisited the topic some in subsequent years, so I'll repost a more recent revised version below to a [similar question](/r/AskHistorians/comments/cdga07/)

------------------------------------

The most important thing to understand with this is the origins and context of that 25 percent number. During World War II, S.L.A. Marshall studied the combat effectiveness of the American GI. Based on hundreds of after action interviews conducted with rifle companies in Europe, he came to his famous conclusion that:

>In an average experienced infantry company in an average stern day's action, the number engaging with any and all weapons was approximately 15 per cent of the total strength. In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25 per cent of the total strength from the opening to the close of the action.

This was a *huge* deal, and as you allude to set the US military on a path of overhauling their training in an effort to raise firing rates and the general willingness to shoot the enemy.

Many people are probably best aware of the whole matter through the Black Mirror episode which is a direct reference to these findings, the title borrowing from Marshall's book, published in 1947 as *Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command in Future War*.

**The problem is that his book is based on bullshit**. It is generally concluded at this point that he conducted far fewer interviews than he claimed, and that he never actually recorded the information on which he claimed to have based these statistics. No notes, correspondence, or other papers which can be used to reconstruct his data survive, and what information he did offer in the years after is misleading and contradictory. Roger Spiller's 1988 article is one of the most important of several take-downs of Marshall's work, and from which I will quote:

>In Men Against Fire Marshall claims to have interviewed ""approximately"" 400 infantry rifle com­panies in the Pacific and in Europe, but. that number tended to change over the years. In 1952, the number had somehow grown to 603 companies; five years later, his sample had declined to ""something over 500"" companies. Those infantry companies-what­ever their actual number-were his laboratories, the infantrymen his test subjects, and at the focal point of his research was the ratio of fire. ""Why the subject of fire ratios under combat conditions has not been long and searchingly explored, I don't know,"" Marshall wrote. ""I suspect that it is because in earlier wars there had never existed the opportunity for *systematic collection of data*"". (Italics added by Spiller).

>Opportunity aplenty existed in Europe: more than 1200 rifle companies did their work between June 1944, and V-E day, 10 months later.  But Marshall required by his own standard two and sometimes three days with a company to examine one day's combat. By the most generous calculation, Marshall would have finished ""approximately"" 400 interviews sometime in October or November 1946, or at about the time he was writing Men Against Fire.

>This calculation assumes, however, that of all the questions Marshall might ask the soldiers of a rifle company during his interviews, he would unfailingly want to know who had fired his weapon and who had not. Such a question, posed interview after interview, would have signalled that Marshall was on a particular line of inquiry, and that regardless of the other information Marshall might discover, he was devoted to investigating this facet of combat  performance. John Westover, usually in attendance during Mar­shall's sessions with the troops, does not recall Marshall's ever asking this question. Nor does West­over recall Marshall ever talking about ratios of weapons usage in their many private conversations. Marshall's own personal correspondence leaves no hint that he was ever collecting statistics. His surviving field notebooks show no signs of statistical compilations that would have been necessary to deduce a ratio as precise as Marshall reported later in Men Against Fire. The ""systematic collection of data"" that made Marshall's ratio of fire so authoritative appears to have been an invention.

Now, the irony is that Marshall probably wasn't *wrong*. Even Spiller, in his piece, concludes that Marshall likely was trying to create a scientific backing from what he felt more intuitively from ""his own experiences and observations of war"". He certainly conducted interviews, and certainly talked with many soldiers, and even if he made the numbers up, he did have the sense that many soldiers *were* refusing to fire, and this needed to change. So he was full of shit and in complete violation of academic ethics... but he was motivated by what he saw as good reasons, namely a boot to the butt of the US Army to improve things. In reality, we really have no idea what the number was, as at absolute best it was a rough guess, and he could have been quite far off both in numbers and reasons. In any case, it is a fairly serious problem with Marshall's work, one which casts a serious shadow on it and one which any subsequent researcher using it must grapple with.

Which brings us to the other issue I want to address... Marshall was in large part discredited after Spiller's article, and at best used with caution. And regardless, since *Men Against Fire* was published, better, more honest works which explore the same issues of combat motivation have come out such as Glenn's *Reading Athena's Dance Card: Men Against Fire in Vietnam*, Kellet's *Combat Motication: The Behavior of Soldiers in Battle*, or Engen's *Strangers in Arms: Combat Motivation in the Canadian Army*, but these don't pique the conventional psyche. Two factors are of note. One is the appeal it has for the image of the citizen-soldier, a reluctant warrior. In his article on combat motivation, Daddis lays a fair bit of blame at the feet of Stephen Ambrose and his *Band of Brothers* for its fixing this in modern American minds. I won't disagree.

Bigger though is Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, whose book *On Killing* was, in comparison to more academic works on the topic, a much more accessible work for the general reader. It also commits the same sins as Marshall, although perhaps more inexcusable in that it is so *obvious*, in that he has his conclusion and tries to fit evidence to it. He cherry picks information, ignores what he doesn't agree with, is absolutely terrible about good citing practices, and for our purposes here, *uncritically used Marshall's numbers as accurate and uncontroversial*. I would tentatively argue that Grossman is single-handedly responsible for resurrecting Marshall and giving his work a new, and undeserved life. Although he did eventually publish a response to critics, which you can read [here](http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo9/no4/18-grossman-eng.asp), but is fairly evasive and doesn't really say anything in his defense. Grossman had parlayed his success into more books, and a post-military career as a lecturer to police and military groups which is not really for discussion here due to the 20 year rule, but suffice to say, he has no real motivation to be academically honest at this point, and in my estimation, it shows.

AskHistorians,Why is Robin Hood so heavily associated with that particular hat?,"Why is a bit of a tough question, but I can at least give you an idea of when it started.

The oldest-known surviving text about Robin Hood, from the early 15th century, mentions his wearing *a* hat (specifically, ""in hat and hood"" is the description). At the time, hoods were  fairly common headgear in England, regardless of social status; however, hats denoted a higher status, so this line would've immediately marked Robin Hood as someone with a bit more wealth or social class to a contemporary reader. (Margaret Scott's Medieval Costume and Clothing)

Why this hat specifically though? Well, that may actually be a product of medieval thrift, interestingly. The first such image of Robin Hood comes from ""A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hude,"" which was a very popular telling of the story (and one of the oldest complete narratives) printed by Jan van Doesbroch in Antwerp in the early 16th century. The illustration of Robin Hood was similar to the modern iconography, and anyone familiar with the Errol Flynn or Disney versions would recognize it. But it wasn't originally drawn for Lytell Geste; it was actually an illustration of the Knights Yeoman from Canterbury Tales, which the same printer had printed just earlier. It's likely it was reused to save money on having a new press designed and created.

If you read the description of the knight's yeoman from Chaucer, you can definitely see where Robin Hood could've descended from.

https://www.owleyes.org/text/canterbury-tales/read/the-yeoman#root-218778-1

It's well known that certain scenes in Disney's Robin Hood re-used animation from the earlier the Jungle Book - so maybe that was to save money for a struggling studio, but I like to think it was honoring a tradition in portraying Robin Hood.

AskHistorians,"In 19th century English literature, a child (even 4-5) is often referred to as ""it."" At what age did children normally take ""human"" pronouns? When did this convention die out?","The varying degrees of gendering of children in speech through history is something which you're not the first to notice. 

At its most basic level, we might trace this ""it"" usage back to when English had a system of grammatical gender: in Old English (OE), *cild* — pronounced similar to Present Day English (PDE) *chilled* — and *bearn* were the standard words for ""child"" (*bearn* [is claimed](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/31619) to be akin to ""son or daughter"" where *cild* is more generic) and both had neuter grammatical gender, like the German word *Kind*. 

However, a) even at the time it was used inconsistently, b) other equivalent words didn't maintain their grammatically-sourced pronouns, and c) English has *really* thoroughly lost its grammatical gender system, so this explanation is unsatisfactory. Regarding the OE use, [Curzan \(2003\)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/gender-shifts-in-the-history-of-english/114DB77B6E95F078C2A66FDEE978526A) points out a couple things: one, *wifmann* (masculine, whence modern *woman*), *wif* (neuter, whence *wife*), and *mægden* (neuter, *maiden*) were also exceptions; two, there's a sizeable quantity of neuter uses *only* with *cild*. For example, 116/118 instances of the word *wif* in the data she used were accompanied by, basically, she/her. For *bearn* it's mostly masculine/feminine, with a couple neuters slipping in. For *cild* (and also Middle English cild/child/<many other spellings>) it's more varied. She gives the example of two texts (*Alfred's Boethius* and *The Passion of St Margaret*, if anyone's interested), where the author changes their pronoun use through the text:

> That foolishness is most like, that a **child** be born full heathy and full sound, and so perfectly flourishing in all virtues and skills, while **it** is in boyhood, and so forth all of adolescence, until **he** becomes capable in every art; and then a little before **his** middle-age.... [I know this is weirdly phrased, but Curzan translates it barely one step beyond a gloss]

> And God's servant Theotimus found the **child** and he took **it** up and entrusted **it** to be well fed. And when **it** had acquired understanding, he gave **it** a name, and that was **Margaret**, and [he] afterwards set **her** to learning and **she** fully excelled thereon...

This is something which you see later in the history of English too: children vary between neuter and masculine/feminine use in Middle English and Modern English — honestly, even into the 20th and 21st centuries a little bit — with *it* being more common among younger children than older ones. There's a hypothesis here that it's not about *personhood* so much as it is about to what extent the children show identifiable characteristics of gender: even once they start walking and talking, children really aren't that differentiated biologically, and socially it's been quite varied through history (there are plenty of other answers in this subreddit about how young children have been treated historically), so sometimes *it* pops out when the child isn't seen as being instantiated as a member of their gender. 

I don't know how convincing I find this explanation either, because there is a very obvious counterargument: why don't/didn't people just use 'they'? There's a book which I wish I had access to, because, from what I can tell, it goes into exactly this question, with a synchronic analysis of ""epicene"" (i.e. not varying for semantic gender) pronouns in PDE, but I just can't seem to find it anywhere online, and don't want to trek all the way to the British Library or the Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Bremen for a hard copy. If anyone is particularly savvy with hunting down PhD theses, it's ""`Newman, Michael 1997. Epicene Pronouns: The Linguistics of a Prescriptive Problem . New York, London: Garland.`""

I hope this was at least somewhat helpful in going into the history of this phenomenon, even if there isn't an especially conclusive answer at the end! The history of gendered language in English is quite complicated, but very interesting nonetheless."
AskHistorians,I understand tropical fruits were rare in medieval Europe. So how did the colour orange become synonymous with the fruit rather than the more common carrot?,"The simple answer is that carrots were not generally orange in mediaeval Europe. From both pictures and descriptions we have from both Ancient Greek and mediaeval works of natural history (like a Byzantine copy of a work by Dioscorides, possibly the most famous ancient Western botanist, and after whom we get *Dioscorea*, the scientific name for the yam genus), and even paintings well into the Renaissance, they could be orange, but also red, yellow, purple, white and other shades. These other carrot colours still exist, but are far less popular, while the distribution was far more evenly spread back then. It is only later in the early modern period - after oranges were widespread - that carrots became associated so closely with orange. Oranges by contrast were always orange (though of course they are one of many hybrid citrus fruits of many colours). 

Carrots reached Europe much earlier than oranges, originating in Central Asia and Iran, and having been known to the classical Greeks. Citrus fruit in general were known to South East Asia and India in ancient - even prehistoric - times, but only reached Europe in significant numbers after the Islamic expansion and conquest of Spain. So both arrived in Europe via Persia, but at quite different times, so that for a long while oranges were seen as more ‘exotic’, and were much more expensive, there. 

Unlike carrots, oranges were relatively expensive and exotic, and names of colours used for decoration (and heraldry, with an example below) tended to be from flowers, expensive dye sources, etc. rather than common vegetables. ‘Orange’ as a colour word started out as a particular ‘poetic’ choice for its colour, where at least in English ‘yellow-red’ (‘geoluhread’ in Old English) had been used more generally before. 

In fact, there is some debate about whether this might even not be a coincidence - that carrots are now usually orange *because* oranges are orange - but as usual the truth is a lot more complex. This is extremely close to a very popular anecdote of sorts that I hope I’m allowed to address. 

The rather cute but meandering etymological story goes like this: ‘orange’ comes from the ancient Tamil (or other Dravidian) word for ‘fragrant fruit’, or ‘narangal’. This is turn went through Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic - following the spread of the fruit- before ending up in Spain as ‘naranja’. The ‘n’ was then rebracketed, conflated with the ‘n’ from ‘un’, in Occitan and then French to be ‘une orange’ (this isn’t uncommon: ‘a napron’ became ‘an apron’, ‘a numpire’ became ‘an umpire’).  This became used for the colour, as is not uncommon with plants considered to have aesthetic value (violet, indigo, pink, lavender, lilac, saffron, etc. - all more glamorous than a root vegetable, it must be said). 

The small town of Arausio in ancient Gaul, named after a Celtic river god, went through multiple sound changes and eventually became ‘Orange’, easily conflated with the name of the fruit, and its ruling family became the Counts of Orange, and then through intermarriage a line came to rule Nassau, converted to Protestantism, and were brought in to defend the Netherlands from Spain - eventually becoming the dominant stadtholder - and now royal - family of the Netherlands. Naturally, the family’s chosen colour was orange, and this colour came to represent the Netherlands. 

The story goes that the Netherlands dominated European trade to such an extent that they managed to favour the orange carrot for patriotic reasons to the point that it became the dominant cultivar. (Some versions even go so far as to say they *created* orange carrots, though this is certainly false as we do have records of orange carrots that predate the Dutch Republic). Unfortunately, the truth is difficult to pin down. It is true that the Dutch dominated a great deal of agricultural maritime trade, and it is over the course of the early modern that the production of orange carrots relative to others exploded. It is also possible that one particular strain may have been favoured elsewhere and boomed very rapidly to replace others elsewhere, which may have had multiple advantages including the symbolic link, rather than the Dutch managing to drown out the supply by sheer quantity. However, we do not have solid evidence that the Dutch did have a major selection in favour of the colour (which was not the royal national colour it is now - it did not even appear on the Republic’s flag - EDIT: or per u/Paixdieu’s comment below, the red-white-blue and Prince’s orange-white-blue flags were at least blurred together as flags of ‘the Republic’ - orange was not the Dutch national colour in the manner it is today), and nor do we have clear evidence that the bulk of modern carrots descend from ones grown in the Netherlands or selected by Dutch traders (EDIT: apparently for this point we do, see the 2013 paper linked below in the correction by u/Paixdieu, but we do lack any solid evidence that it was the Dutch selecting orange specifically for this reason). Have to admit that the idea that “Carrots are orange because oranges are orange and ‘fragrant fruit’ in Old Tamil sounds a little like the name of a Gaulish river god” would be a delightful fun fact - but we just don’t have solid evidence for that last link, even if it gets repeated by major media outlets on occasion. (But we can at least make a similar claim about the Dutch royal colour!)"
AskHistorians,Did American men really wear a coat and tie at home during the 1930s and 1940s?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"In The Tale of Genji, does the protagonist rape women, or is it just complicated courtship?","Uji monogatari (2nd part after Genji dies) is basically all rape and a pretty intense criticism of it to boot, but let's go back to Genji since that part is often left out in the English versions (and it is possibly written by someone else given the sudden shift in tone). 

Some of the women are raped, most are also in love with Genji, and all of them are in complicated court power dynamics and courtship regulations at the time. A few of them are complicated courtships, in that they are not really given the chance to refuse and it is taken as an unfortunate reality of court life. Arguably the most intentionally damaging actions are from the mad ghost of Rokujo towards the women Genji sleeps with (she outright murders Yuugao) rather than from Genji himself. We also have one instance where Genji is refused and has his way with the lady's brother, but we don't know how the brother felt about it. 

However, keep in mind that Genji Monogatari is a work of ficfion from a very court-critical lady-in-waiting to a very exclusive group of educated women. Unfortunately modern readers tend to read historical fiction with a tendency to see it high class and ""how things should be done"" (see how people miss Shakespeare's toilet humour). A lot of the book was written to entertain and even crticise court life. 

1. Ladies of the court were *very, very bored* and love affairs were considered a pastime activity. So the complicated courtship (and hearing about forbidden love) was a means of entertainment. However, the lady listeners were also subject to similar advances from other court men, so this could have also been cathartic (as they did not necessarily enjoy the visits themselves, so might as well listen to a story where the undesired visitor is a young and handsome figure of power). 

2. Murasaki repeatedly wrote in her diaries how drunken and stupid the men of the court were, and much of genji monogatari can be seen as reflecting that. She detested court life and its social activities. Irony and sarcasm were a thing, and it is possible that many of the love affairs in the book were written with that intention. 

Additionally, This is more of a theory and not proven, but some writers believe Murasaki Shikibu was not into men. Aside from her arranged marriage (only two years - she never remarried) and woes about her patron courting her (implications given power dynamics at the time do unfortunately point to her being raped, though she never mentions it; only that he never won her love but still pursued her, and if is known that his patronage was necessary to make a living). So it is possible that it is just how she sees men courting, and without explicitly calling it rape and devasating (aside from uji monogatari) she is clearly showing unhappy situations for genji's women."
AskHistorians,Did Frederick the Great really use reverse potato psychology on his subjects?,"After a certain point, you kind of have to ask yourself ""did any of it happen at all?""

A nearly identical story is part of the story of the potato in France. Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, according to his protégé Julien-Joseph Virey: ""Parmentier arranged for gendarmes to guard them - but only during the day. His intention was for them to be stolen during the night and the populace did not fail to oblige.""

So there are, at minimum, three individuals to whom the story is being attributed. The Parmentier event is from before the Kapodistrias event, apparently happening some time around 1787, as that is when the king granted him some land specifically for the whole potato endeavor per *Histoire de Montdidier* by Victor de Beauvillé (Book IV - Chapter II - Section LIV). In short, Parmentier had a specific field that he definitely could have done this with... if it happened, of course. What does appear to be historical is the lavish potato-based dinner parties he threw in order to get the *aristocracy* to better accept the potato. Same as how the potato decrees are historical for Frederick the Great.

It isn't impossible that it simply happened three times, or that two of them, upon hearing about the first, decided to try the same bit of reverse psychology again. Or it could be some degree of ""great man"" revisionism.

In [*Feeding the People: The Politics of the Potato* by Rebecca Earle](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/feeding-the-people/immigrant-potatoes/46D247BCC4281E145ADD0FF361C234D2), she notes that although these kinds of stories seem to pop up all over Europe, it seems as though they might be more of an indicator that the potato was being more accepted by the elite/aristocracy. Frederick's decree appears to be historical, but it occurred in the mid 18th century, and Prussian farmers had been growing the things since shortly after their introduction in the 16th century. He certainly promoted the growth of the potato on a near-industrial scale, but the historical record indicates that he did so via decrees, and to assume that the potato was distrusted by the peasants before then is a bit much. Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius, writing back in the late 16th century in his *Rariorum Plantarum Historia*, indicated that the plants were pretty commonly consumed in parts of Germany and Italy. In Diaeteticon, a german *cookbook* by Johann Sigismund Elsholtz in 1682, he outright calls the tubers (translated) ""zimlich gemein bei uns""[Quite common with us].

It is monumentally difficult to prove a negative in any of these cases. Could they have happened? Sure. Do they happen to sound exactly like the kind of fabricated story we might expect to hear if people were intent on showing how the intelligent aristocrats tricked the stupid peasants for their own good? *Absolutely.*

But again, I can't prove that it never happened, and at this point we are suffering from an issue of an endless citation chain (as in, no primary or semi-contemporary source) combined with hearsay. The only story for this that has a contemporary source is the Parmentier one, as far as I am aware. Could Julien-Joseph Virey have included that story in his posthumous biography of Parmentier after hearing about it in regards to Frederick the Great? Possibly, but critically I can't actually find any solid citation related to Frederick the Great doing this prior to the 20th century, and even today most scholars give this anecdote all the consideration it deserves: they call it out as an anecdote. The Greek thing? Maybe, but the potato was in Italy as of the late 1500s, I find it unlikely that the Greeks were somehow unaware of it for two centuries, but the guy certainly could have read about it at that point. Overall, the Parmentier event has the best evidence of being the originator of the story, if it ever happened. Whether you believe it or not pretty much depends on if you accept Julien-Joseph Virey's biography of Parmentier as truth.

Edit: The citation page for Earle's book is being a bit wonky through that link, but many of the same citations are found in an article on the same topic she wrote in 2017, [Promoting Potatoes in Eighteenth-Century Europe](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/people/staff_index/earle/promoting_potatoes_in_the_18c.pdf)."
AskHistorians,"Historians, what do you think is currently the single most controversial or debated topic in your specific area of study, and what is it about?","The Amarna period (ca. 1350-1330 BCE) is by far the most contentious topic in the history of the Late Bronze Age, if indeed not all of preclassical history. To summarize the period briefly, the Egyptian king Amenhotep IV of the 18th Dynasty moved the royal court to the new capital city of Akhetaten (modern Tell el-Amarna), which had been built hurriedly from scratch, and changed his name to Akhenaten (""Effective Spirit of the Aten""). Akhenaten more or less abandoned the worship of the traditional Egyptian pantheon and focused his efforts on the Aten, the sun disc. The Amarna period introduced numerous changes to Egyptian culture, such as the use of the contemporary dialect of Egyptian (Late Egyptian) for royal inscriptions rather than the archaic Middle Egyptian – somewhat akin to a shift from Chaucerian English to modern English – and an emphasis on liveliness and movement in art heavily inspired by Aegean and Levantine artistic motifs. Amarna was abandoned shortly after Akhenaten's reign, most of his reforms were overturned, and his reign was erased from Egyptian histories in a damnatio memoriae. 

So much ink has been spilled on this period of ancient Egyptian history that two books have been written on the historiograpy and reception of the Amarna period, [*Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt*](https://books.google.com/books?id=AGV9AwAAQBAJ) by Dominic Montserrat and [*Akhenaten: A Historian's View*](https://books.google.com/books?id=fGtjEAAAQBAJ) by Ronald Ridley.  As Montserrat states bluntly,

> I do not want to write another over-personalised psychobiography of Akhenaten, reconstructing his motivations, feelings and emotions. It would be marvellous if one could say with authority that Akhenaten had Oedipal fantasies about his parents, or that ""there can be no doubt that both Akhenaten and Nefertiti were extremely proud of
their six daughters,"" or that Akhenaten's sister was the ""little companion"" of their mother's lonely widowhood, or that ""the perfect life of the royal family was shattered"" by child deaths – but one can't, because the evidence is not there.

>These quotations all come from the standard, most easily available works on Akhenaten by professional Egyptologists. As well as being sentimental and wholly speculative, they illustrate the central problem that his biography is rarely written with any neutrality. More than any other period of Egyptian history, Akhenaten's reign evokes emotive narratives and personalised responses, even from conservative academics who have had long scholarly connections with it. This is true of the authors of the two most authoritative English-language biographies, *Akhenaten, King of Egypt* (1988, still in print) by Cyril Aldred (1914-91), and Donald Redford's *Akhenaten, the Heretic King* (1984). Both biographies are scholarly works based on an exhaustive knowledge of the period, and in many ways they are still indispensable. Yet they paint radically different pictures of the king and his reign, which ultimately derive from Redford disliking Akhenaten and Aldred thinking he was admirable. To their credit, neither author makes any attempt to disguise his opinion...

There is, as Montserrat pointed out, a great deal we do not know about the Amarna period (and may never know). As an example, let's consider Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti. Nefertiti is well known today for the lovely [bust in the Neues Museum in Berlin](https://www.smb.museum/fileadmin/_processed_/6/f/csm_AEMP_Nofretete_Bueste_frontal_1f8d333776.jpg). Despite Nefertiti's fame, however, what can we say about her life as queen? 

* She held the rank of chief queen consort (""Great Royal Wife"").

* She bore Akhenaten six daughters.

* Her childhood nurse was Tiy, the wife of the official Ay (who later became king, ruling after Tutankhamun). 

* She had a sister named Mutnedjmet. 

* She participated in religious ceremonies. 

* She owned estates that produced wine. 

That is essentially all one can objectively say about Nefertiti. Everything else is speculation. Did Nefertiti ever engage in diplomatic correspondence with kings and queens abroad like Akhenaten's mother Tiye? Did Tiye and Nefertiti get along like a house on fire, or did they despise each other? How did Nefertiti feel about Akhenaten's other wives like Kiya? Did Nefertiti play an active role in the raising of her daughters? Did Nefertiti show any interest in politics as queen consort, perhaps butting heads with the vizier over issues of governance in the king's absence? Did Nefertiti ever travel without the king, perhaps even abroad to the Egyptian vassal kingdoms in the southern Levant? There is so much that we simply do not know!

To list just a few of the lingering questions about the Amarna period that have been hotly debated,

* Why did Akhenaten enact his reforms? Was he a true believer driven by religious fervor? Was it politically motivated, with the move to Amarna designed to weaken the entrenched nobility and priesthood of Thebes? A mix of both?

* Who were Nefertiti's parents? Was her father Ay, as many Egyptologists believe? 

* Is Nefertiti's sister the same individual as the similarly named wife of Horemheb, who ruled as king after Ay?

* Who was Tutankhamun's father? Was it Akhenaten? Smenkhkare, a poorly known king who was possibly Akhenaten's younger brother?

* Who was the widowed Egyptian queen who wrote to the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I asking for one of his sons for marriage? Nefertiti? Smenkhkare's wife Meritaten? Tutankhamun's wife Ankhesenamun? 

* Who murdered the Hittite prince Zannanza, sent to Egypt to marry the dowager queen?"
AskHistorians,"Only 0.57% of modern day Italians have red hair, but they are much more represented in Italian paintings from the 15th and 16th century, and also in descriptions of people like emperor Nero. Where have all the redheads gone? Or were there never that much in the first place?","This is a good question. One thing to keep in mind at the start of this discussion, is that art from that era, while lauded for its realism, wasn't necessarily depicting reality. There was often a lot of symbolism poured into the work. And often the source of this symbolism was the single piece of media that everyone knew.

The Bible.

It was basically the unifying document of Europe at the time. Everyone knew it. Even if you were illiterate. Everyone could make a connection to the Bible. You could be from Scandinavia and you knew the same set of stories as someone from Sicily or even the Levant. 

This is relevant, because around the 6th century, the belief sprung up that Mary Magdalene was a red head. This, was based on the story of Rahab the Harlot. Rahab lived in Jericho and saved two Israelite spies sent to check out the city defense. Rahab let the two spies escape the city by lowering them to the ground on a ""scarlet cord."" The Israelites then told her to tie the cord to her door, so that the invading army wouldn't destroy her home and family. Very similar to the blood on the lintel in the Passover story. (Joshua 2 14:16) As time went by, this morphed into red *hair* being a sign of prostitution. By the 6th century, it was believed that biblical prostitutes had red hair. This may be based on a Roman custom of requiring prostitutes to identify themselves by dying their hair blonde to distinguish them from ""proper women."" What this meant was that Mary Magdalene, who was incorrectly identified as a prostitute in a homily by Pope Gregory the Great in 591. Why? Nobody is sure. But, it wasn't acknowledged as an error by the church until 1961. At this point though, red = prostitute and Mary Magdalene = prostitute. Magdalene is also associated (wrongly, thanks to Pope Gregory the Great,) with the act of anointing Jesus' feet with her tears and oil and *wiping his feet clean with her hair.* Somehow, this translated into Mary Magdalene having red hair. Even though, she most definitely didn't. 

So, here is where things get sort of tricky...red hair becomes associated with sexuality and lust, but *also* with piety. Magdalene is both a saint and a sinner. Literally. She occupies both spaces in the narrative. She is a fallen woman who ends up becoming the ""apostle of the apostles."" A woman who has her remains venerated. 

So, when artists like Botticelli and Titian created paintings, they used red to symbolize a sort of acceptable lustfulness. Botticelli's *Birth of Venus* is a great example. A full nude Venus with long, red, locks. Titian did the same with paintings like *Sacred and Profane Love*, which depicts the same red headed woman as clothed and unclothed in the same scene. The proper sacred love, and the nude profane love. 

Even in the modern era we associate red with love and sex. Valentines are red. We have red-light districts. We use the same symbolism as they did hundreds of years ago. 

So, that explains the plethora of gingers in art. 

The Nero example is far simpler. While Suetonius says he had red hair, this is probably based off of who his father was. Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The last name translates as ""red beard."" It could be that simple."
AskHistorians,"2021 saw an unexpected wave of sea shanty revivalism, but how popular were songs like 'Wellerman', 'Old Maui', and other sea songs and shanties in practice among Whaling and other vessels?","Traditional maritime music is a broad category that is often cross pollinated with other folk music of the times. For this explanation we're just going to divide it into three groups.

First we have actual sea shanties. These are songs that were sung by sailors while they were doing work on ships ( or next to them for the purpose of loading). These were not songs that were sung for enjoyment but to keep everyone in time, they weren't sung off ships and in fact some sailors found it bad luck to sing them off of ships. All these songs would be sung acapella, many of them featuring call and response. The shanties are then further divided depending on the length and nature of the task. So we have  shanties for hauling, heaving,  the capstan, the windlass, the pumps and so on. As shanties could vary in length depending on how long it took to complete the task, the verses tended to be modular. This meant that verses from one shanty may show up in another shanty depending on if you need to extend the song. It also meant that there was no set order for how the verses should go, as the song wasn't really about telling the story it was about maximizing efficiency on the ship, and keeping everyone in time. These songs were also developed organically from sailors on maritime vessels and would be shared through an oral process. Often they would be written down by other people.

Second, we have songs that are sung off-watch. These songs are called forebitters or fo'c'sle songs.  These are songs that sailors would sing for their own enjoyment. Many of these songs would also be popular songs of the day that sailors would learn when they were in port.  Unlike shanty's these songs could often have musical accompaniment.

Finally, we have just generic sea songs. These are songs that were written about various maritime subjects but they were written and performed on land for audiences there.

Now other songs you specifically brought up, Old Maui was most definitely sung on ships. According to Gale Huntington in his book  ""***Songs the Whaleman Sang***"" there is a version called ""*Rolling Down to Old Mohee*"" from a journal that was written aboard the vessel Atkins Adams in 1858. Starting in the 1820s Maui, and the Hawaiian islands as a whole, were utilized as home bases for Yankee whaling fleets. Now this song was most definitely a forebitter sung while the sailors were relaxing. There is a narrative structure in the lyrics that necessitates a certain order as well as the general rhythm of the song not being conducive to work.  The most popular version of this song uses the melody that originates from ""*The Miller of Dee*"". That song originated in the 1762 ballad opera ""Love in the Village"" by Isaac Bickerstaffe and became popular in Northwest England.

The Wellermen is a sea ballad that comes from New Zealand. Now the lyrics tell a story as well as the different melodies of the song this isn't really conducive to being sung as a shanty. If we look at the subject matter as well as the context it helps give us an idea.  According to ""***Folksongs of New Zealand***""  by Neil Colquhuin, New Zealand whalers practice shore whaling ( also known as bay whaling). This was something that was common in New England in the early colonial days.  First they would go out on small boats, kill the whale and then bring it back to shore for processing. These whalers were not paid wages and therefore were paid ""stake"". This would include ready-made goods such as tobacco, liquor or clothing. These goods of course would be supplied to their workstations via supply ships run by the Weller Brothers. The trading agents on these ships were referred to as ""Wellermen"". Now the song does describe tall ship whaling, going after an elusive right whale, but this seems to be a fictional creation as opposed to something drawn from their own experience. No we can't say for sure this was never sung on a ship as say a forebitter. But what we do know is the first time it was collected was in the 1960s by Neil Colquhuin in New Zealand.  The song does not show up in collections from other maritime nations. So even if it was sung on ships as a forebitter in that area, the song might not have caught on with crews from other parts of the world.

I do want to end this with a little side note. That sometimes The crew of a whaling ship may be forbidden to sing on their off time depending on the captain who was king. Of course it varied from ship to ship.   I highly recommend ""***Leviathan: The History of Whaling in America***"" by Eric Jay Dolin. Of course it's focus is the development of that  industry in America, not really focusing on the music aboard these ships. That said it is a very well researched book that can fill you in not just about the life of the whalers themselves but their place in the world economy at the time.

Also I will summon u/JBSongman who has done much study on maritime music."
AskHistorians,I've been waiting years to ask: why did we all go absolutely bananas for The DaVinci Code in 2003?,"This sort of question can sometimes be near-impossible to answer; why did the infinite-loop video 
Badger Badger Badger ([video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIyixC9NsLI)) go viral in 2003? 
People like animal videos? Yes, true, but why _that_ animal video and not the infinite number of others? Why
Dan Brown's conspiracy novel and not the many others?

Here we have the useful circumstance (in a historian's sense) 
of _The Da Vinci Code_ not being Dan Brown's first novel, or even the first novel featuring the character Robert Langdon.
The first Langdon novel was _Angels & Demons_ (2000) which didn't sell very well at all, so comparison of the
circumstances between the two launches is useful, and Brown himself is quite frank there was a difference in both the
novelistic content and how the two books were marketed.

While Dan Brown (collaborating with his then-wife, Blythe Brown) technically started writing in the mid-90s, it was with _Angels & Demons_ that he hit upon, as he put in his own words, ""the idea of the thriller as academic lecture"".

>I tried to write a book that I would love to read. The kind of books I enjoy are those in which you learn. My hope was that readers would be entertained and also learn enough to want to use the book as a point of departure for more reading.

One important point here is that Dan Brown is, in essence, a True Believer; while he is writing fiction and has the standard disclaimer about any resemblances between real people and story people being a coincidence, he also wants to proselytize ideas; as mentioned in a prefatory note to _The Da Vinci Code_, he believes ""All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate."" This puts his writing in the same category as popular pseudo-historians who tell The Truth They Didn't Want You To Know, like Hancock's [_Fingerprints of the Gods_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fingerprints_of_the_Gods/QhuM8zPCoQgC?hl=en) from 1995.

But! ... just a conspiracy hook wasn't enough. Part of the blame was put on the publisher, Simon & Schuster, who originally promised a 60,000 copy print run with major advertising and a 12 city tour. However, the print run ended up being reduced to 12,000 and Dan and Blythe resorted to self-advertising:

>Blythe and I were heartbroken as we had put so much work into this book. Once again, we took matters into our own hands, booking our own signings, booking our own radio shows, and selling books out of our car at local events.

Also, _Angels & Demons_ perhaps was a little mild with its conspiracy leap: it went for the Illuminati, and a conspiracy involving stealing a canister of anti-matter from CERN. The Illuminati -- if we're looking at the book as a combination story / pseudo-history lecture -- was not novel enough to get attention.

The duo found a new agent (Heidi Lange) who helped collaborate on subject matter for the next book. They quite intentionally went for, according to various biographical materials, something ""controversial"" and ""shocking"", something that would relate to people's everyday experience yet turn their idea of that experience on their head. That is, the Illuminati (not in most people's daily headspace) would not shock, but a plot that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene had a child (that later became a lineage of kings) would. It wasn't strictly novel (Dan Brown lists _The History of the Knights Templars_ and _The Goddess In the Gospels_ among other books) but importantly, it wasn't well-known.

In the meantime, Jason Kaufman (who was Dan Brown's editor and main booster at Simon & Schuster) changed jobs over to Doubleday, taking Brown with him. This was done with reticence (Brown's prior novels, as already mentioned, were not hot sellers) but Stephen Rubin, the president of Doubleday, was impressed enough by the outline of _The Da Vinci Code_ that he gave the deal the green light, and a contract that seemed a bit much for such a small-selling author: $400,000 for a two book contract.

The fact this was based on the _outline_ and not the full book indicates that the publisher was well-aware of the potential impact of the subject matter.

The publisher also took the launch seriously, heavily pushing advance copies (printing 10,000, compare to the first printing of _Angels & Demons_!) and went for grassroots support as opposed to a physical marketing campaign. Despite large modern condemnation for Dan Brown's prose, early reviews were favorable; from the New York Times:

>The word for ''The Da Vinci Code'' is a rare invertible palindrome. Rotated 180 degrees on a horizontal axis so that it is upside down, it denotes the maternal essence that is sometimes linked to the sport of soccer. Read right side up, it concisely conveys the kind of extreme enthusiasm with which this riddle-filled, code-breaking, exhilaratingly brainy thriller can be recommended.

>That word is wow.

I wouldn't say controversy caused the sales -- the first printing of 230,000 sold out quite quickly, too quickly for various academics to level their disapproval -- but it is true there became a cottage industry of ""debunking _The Da Vinci Code_"" which only served to help things along. (Unlike the 1971 movie version of _The Exorcist_, where the film studio claimed condemnation from the Catholic Church even though it didn't have any in order to bump up ticket sales, with _The Da Vinci Code_, there was plenty of real condemnation that could be used to stoke up the hype.)

So, in comparison, the reason _The Da Vinci Code_ did well and _Angels & Demons_ did not is:

a.) _Angels & Demons_ did not have a premise that would be considered shocking of one's daily world-view; _The Da Vinci Code_ was intentionally written so it would have one

b.) The publisher of _Angels & Demons_ only used traditional marketing, was fairly lax about it besides, and did not have much faith in the product, cutting the initial production run

c.) _The Da Vinci Code_ got a new publisher and agent which recognized they had something hot and resorted to a grassroots push of advance reading copies

AskHistorians,What's the origin of the children's game where you see a Volkswagen Beetle and punch another child?,"It is very, very, rare for a children's game (or relatedly, piece of slang) to have its origins traced exactly (unless it wasn't from a child at all, but an adult marketing campaign or the like). For example, consider the word ""zoid"", used as a put-down. A researcher named Gary Fine (focused specifically on the culture of Little League Baseball players) managed to find this word was coined by a twelfth-grader, and the word started being used by his friends. The twelfth-grader's brother (in ninth grade) than picked up the word and spread it to _his_ friends. One of those friends played in sixth-grade baseball, and then the word spread amongst the sixth-graders.

At no point did any of these boys then conveniently write a Letter to the Editor containing the word ""zoid"" to immortalize the moment.

So in regard to the actual origins of the games (and words) ""slug bug"" or ""punch buggy"": we don't know and we likely will never know. The only thing we can say essentially with confidence (but not certainty) is it is a US-rooted phenomenon, meaning it had to have been post-1949, when the first Beetle was sent to New York.

We can trace the first official mention in print, but that's often off a long time from the origins, and doesn't really give the kind of ""just so"" story people crave. For example, in my write-up on [I Was Born On a Pirate Ship](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v7oq25/i_was_born_on_a_pirate_ship_whats_the_origin_of/ibnbyyh/?context=3) I was able to give a 1990s reference to an album, but by the time adults are able to make a reference the origin amongst children necessarily goes back farther, even possibly multiple decades. By the time Volkswagen themselves made a reference to an imaginary inventor (""Sluggy Patterson"") for an ad campaign in 2010, the idea had to have long been in the cultural consciousness.

The earliest definitive reference I've found is a curious copyright entry from 1977, _Volkswagen is very accomodating_, a three page booklet as self-published by John T. Balmer, and yes, with the spelling as given. This is prior to the point on Google Ngram when both ""punch buggy"" and ""slug bug"" rise as terms (in the 1980s), but again: Google Ngram is searching written material. Young children (generally speaking) aren't writing things down that get published and end up in libraries.

This is especially true because the words ""slug bug"" (and associated game) seem to be _pre-adolescent subcultural slang_. Children have long been acknowledged to speak in one language register with adults and one with peers. A series of papers from Fine in 1979-1981 collected  slang like ""wedgie"" (tugging up the underwear of a person unawares), ""tinsel teeth"" (boy who wears braces on his front teeth) and ""swirly"" (putting another boy's head in a toilet and flushing it). Fine in a 1987 analysis cross-checked every word collected with general slang collections, like the _Dictionary of American Slang_, which includes words that cross-pollinate with adults (like ""balls"") but do not focus on children. Using that information, he made a smaller collection of words that likely specifically originated with children (rather than being picked up from adults). _Slug bug_ was amongst these words. So the game was likely invented by one enterprising child, who spread it to their friends, who spread it to their friends; I apologize for lacking more detail than that. If you hear about a definitive single-person origin, it is likely another advertising campaign.

AskHistorians,"What's up with this global western phenomenon of formerly rich industrial areas being incredibly poor now? Areas like the Rustbelt, Ruhr Valley, Northern England and Wales, the former mining areas in the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France?","I would argue their very success is the reason for their vulnerability.  An entire ecolosystem grows around the boom industries, not just economic but social, educational, structural. 

If we go back to  social historian E.P. Thompson's classic work, The Making of The English Working Class, he argued that between 1780 and the 1830s a significant class consciousness emerged from early industrialisation. Here to you see dynamics of divergent development, incumbents' economic and cultural resistance to industrialisation, and challenger cities having both the freedom and the necessity to experiment. Thompson wrote:

""I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper, the obsolete hand-loom weaver, the ‘utopian’ artisan, and even the deluded follower of Joanna 
Southcott, from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions 
may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their 
insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience: and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties"" (1963 edition, p.12).

Similarly in the 1970s and 1980s, the incentives for transitioning from manufacturing driven to knowledge and services led ecosystems were negative for the industrial incumbents and powerhouses, and the cost of not adapting could be deferred, as the epicentres of previous industrial modes are also the most resilient to change, and can postpone the pain, by being the last to be existentially hit by macro-economic shifts, given their privileged position in still transitional supply chains, larger economic reserves and access to finance and support,  etc.

This is not a universal rule, but I think it holds as a broad patterns or ideal type.

In contrast, regions left behind by the dominant industrial system have the most incentive to innovate, experiment and seek alternatives. When the new paradigm is still emerging, before it has fully proven itself, the early adopters are likely to come from these areas, and reap early entrant advantages. If the bet pays off, they gain the ability to set the terms of entry to their advantage, and eventually the old incumbents find themselves playing catch up, with a huge weight of economic, cultural and social inertia behind it. 

You are not just modernising manufacture, or shifting to service industries: you are asking people to leave behind company provided housing, working men's clubs, training and apprenticeship pipelines; family loyalties; local choirs; political interests; established subsidies; and memories of status, identity and tradition. As [the History Workshop put it](https://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/deindustrialization-its-aftermath-class-culture-resistance/)

""Inner city areas, one-industry towns, and industrial suburbs were particularly hard-hit, accelerating urban decline, outmigration, employment mobility, and in some cases gentrification. This displacement is often highly gendered and/or racialized.

""In the bitter aftermath of deindustrialization, working-class communities are often enveloped in silence and contend with stigmatization. Anyone who has interviewed displaced workers, or is from a working-class family, has seen or felt some of the pain and suffering that has resulted. Working people have resisted these changes, but a discourse of inevitability has established itself.""

The industrialising pioneers of yesterday, become the luddites of today.

This dynamic of incumbency, social fabric and initial resilience, vs marginality, social fluidity and initial fragility, is definitely a simplification but as an overall narrative it does have an evidence base. 

There have been [studies on divergent cities in post industrial Britain](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/513948/gs-16-2-divergent-cities-post-industrial-britain.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwipxNDn6N_6AhVLPcAKHZVZBroQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3BealXZiEfXl5asyoUokjA) that like me, make the point about the impact of economic structure on the one hand, in particular the global shift from manufacturing to knowledge which we call deindustrialisation; and also of low level, individual city factors around legacies: 

""it appears that larger cities, and 
those with high densities of economic activity, do not seem to have been the most conducive for 
growth, possibly reflecting the legacies of their old industrial past and the limited space for new 
development. This result at least raises some questions over the normal assumption that large 
cities necessarily enjoy positive externalities of agglomeration."" (p.33).

Likewise if you look at [this paper](https://osf.io/xsgf9/download) you will see in table 1 that as a broad pattern, the regions which were most heavily industrial in 1980 tended to be behind in services by 2017, whereas those that were behind in industry in 1980 tended to do better in services.

A closer look shows, like every historian knows, that there are rarely if ever universal explanations, and the pattern does not hold neatly for every cluster of cities and there are plenty of exceptions and moderating factors. Some of the industrial incumbents were also financial and services incumbents even pre-deindustrialisation, like London, and had in place the resources, mindsets and structures to (inequitably), shift their orientation to the emerging opportunities in real time. 

Human factors too, around local and regional policy choices, played a major part in influencing divergent development of regions and cities with similar or overlapping traits. 

So as a historian I would say that if you wanted a high level narrative, my proposed initial analysis above is a good starting point, but at a granular level the history of each city and region will display its own unique characteristics, which will often buck the general pattern I described above."
AskHistorians,"More than sixty-five percent of American soldiers serving in Vietnam were volunteers. Was there a great bout of patriotism, or a belief in the cause that lead to this volunteering? Did volunteers dry up as the war dragged on and the situation was better understood back home?","From a[ previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/by8kqr/were_there_many_volunteer_soldiers_during_vietnam/) of mine:

Something that is often brought up as a misconception about the Vietnam War is the idea that the majority of American soldiers were drafted rather than volunteers. This is often pointed out as being wrong, that there were more men who volunteered than were drafted. On paper, this is true. While 2.2 million men were drafted between 1964 and 1973, a total of 8.7 million men enlisted. However, numbers alone can't tell the whole story.

The actual history is considerably more complicated. Not all men who were drafted or volunteer were actually sent to South Vietnam. Not all volunteers explicitly volunteered to go to South Vietnam. While the majority of the fighting in the early years of the war were fought by volunteers, this would decline over time and draftees would take a considerably higher involvement in the fighting towards the end of the war.

But, let's take a look at the actual volunteers. There were many volunteers who did enlist for all the reasons that young men enlist today (patriotism, adventure, a steady job). In 1968, 20.1 % enlistees stated that the most important reason for enlisting was for personal reasons, an additional 20.1 % stated self-advancement as their reason while 6.1 % stated patriotism, with 6.6 % stating 'none of the above'. Yet the context of the Vietnam War induced many to enlist not for any of the common reasons but rather because of something else that was looming large over their lives at that point of time. The largest percentage of enlisted men stated the draft as being the most important reason for enlisting. 

In his investigation of the ordinary combat soldier in South Vietnam, *Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam* (2000), Dr. Christian G. Appy separates the two categories of volunteers into ""true volunteers"" and ""draft-motivated volunteers"".  In 1968, 54 % of men who voluntary enlisted did so because of the draft. The existence of the draft itself had therefore the consequence of making many young men enlist. As Appy writes, they ""enlisted because they had already received their induction notices or believed they soon would, and thus they enlisted in order, they hoped, to have more choice as to the nature and location of their service.""

The perceived inevitability of the draft could therefore drive many men into a desire to have control over their own fate. In Appy's investigation of working-class men, there were many who were looking for a place where they could escape economic hardships (lack of job security, no access to higher education), issues with family or law enforcement, because 'they had nothing to do', because other men in their social circles were being drafted or enlisted, or because military service ran in their family. As Appy writes, ""[t]these white, working-class men did not regard military service as an opportunity so much as a necessity [...] or an escape"". Young men who entered recruiting offices would be told, with no actual guarantees, that by enlisting they could avoid being sent to South Vietnam. This could end awry, as one soldier stated: ""You knew damn well you were going to get drafted. And you're young and naive so you figure that by enlisting you might get an easy out. The next thing you know you end up in Vietnam."" 

In conclusion, while there was no surge in voluntary enlistment based on patriotism or a perceived danger as in the aftermath of 9/11, the context of the draft and the Vietnam War *did* cause a surge in voluntary enlistment."
AskHistorians,Why is antisemitism so prevalent?,"I can speak to the Biblical background of anti-Judaism. Like the mod above I also specify anti-Judaism because when it's religious, it isn't antisemitism, it's anti-Judaism. Unlike the Nazis, the primary marker of Jewishness for a Christian who hated Jews was not blood – though this becomes complicated, especially as we forge toward the modern era.

Many of the accusations levied against Jews through late antiquity and the medieval era stem from the Bible, warped understandings of the Bible, and crazed conspiracies as developed from those Biblical issues.

Let's focus on Matthew. It's generally held that Matthew was written by a Jewish Christian for a Jewish audience. It has many allusions to the Tanakh, especially prophetic literature. Its goal has two parts: first, to convince ""Matthew""'s Jewish audience that Jesus was the Messiah. Secondly, to argue that humanity and Judaism in particular failed the Messiah. Significant passages in the history of anti-Judaism are drawn from Matthew. Matt 27:25 illustrates it. Pilate says he won't kill Jesus. The crowd, feverish, demands it. Not only that, they shout: ""[Let his] blood be on us and on our children!""

This certainly reads like an anti-Jewish polemic, but it's more complicated given the context.

When Matthew writes this, he isn't writing it as a modern Christian removed from Judaism. He isn't writing as a member of an in-group lambasting an out-group, or a dominant religionist attacking a minority religion. Matthew should be read in light of the catastrophic Jewish revolt and the destruction of the Temple in 70CE. Some scholars argue for a period prior (mostly to miraculize Jesus's predictions of the event within the story) and say it anticipated the carnage (not unreasonable given the tensions between Judaea and Rome) but many of these are non-secular scholars trying to make a religious case. I'm not secular either, but I'm not making a religious case here.

The famous passage where Jesus says the Temple has been made a ""den of thieves"" is one of those earlier references to prophetic literature. He's referring to the Book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah, a real man edited over time and by followers, is saying that the Jews have violated their covenant with God and that God is watching. Not only that, he says that God is warning them time and time again and being ignored. The Book of Jeremiah anticipates the destruction of the First Temple, likely because of the additions after the fact. But it's this detail that Matthew is referring to when he quotes Jesus. The Second Temple will be destroyed, same as the First, because the Jewish people have violated the covenant. In this case Matthew tacks on the charge of failing the Messiah and allowing him to die to the earlier failures. He is, like many Jews have at many points in Biblical and post-Biblical history, recalling an earlier anguish to make a call for his own people to shape up.

Other Jewish commentators like Paul make parallel claims about Jews and Judaism, like his famous idea of the ""spirit"" and the ""letter"" of the Law. But Paul wasn't some Christian coming out of nowhere to write a polemic, he was a Jew who believed Christ to be the fulfillment of Judaism.

There's another dimension here, and that's Rome. Jesus was, of course, not killed by the Jews. The Sanhedrin did not have him executed – though Josephus tells us the Sanhedrin executed his brother James. Rome executed Jesus because they wanted him dead. Crucifixion is a severe punishment for severe crimes. Notably, rebellion. Christians hoping to dodge some heat from Rome might have preferred to blame Jews (whether from the inside in the case of ""Matthew"" or from the outside) because disseminating a bunch of texts about how Rome killed their God. It was hard enough as is for a Christian circa Nero, getting mouthy isn't gonna help.

All of this becomes secondary to political and economic concerns on many occasions. French nobility were not concerned with the blood responsibility for the death of Jesus when they expelled Jews after racking up debts to them. But it does lay an ideological groundwork.

Amy Jill-Levine's Jewish New Testament is a good source to learn more about Christianity in a Jewish context, as well as the relations to Judaism early on."

AskHistorians,How would an ancient Roman or Greek woman appear ‘sexy’ for her partner? What clothes and makeup would they wear?,"I can only comment on ancient Greece, so this answer will focus on Classical Athens.

Greek attitudes to female beauty, much like modern standards, encompassed physical attributes that women had control over, such as cosmetics and clothing, and attributes that they had little to no control over, such as their breasts. Moreover, we actually have very little to go off of concerning women's looks. In plays, women are simply called beautiful or described as having beautiful faces, leaving the audience free ""to project their own ideas of beauty onto these figures"" (Robson, 2013, 119). Instead, discussions of female beauty tend to focus on their bodies.

Of women's physical attributes, their breasts appear to be the main focus of male sexual desire. Many depictions of women in Athenian art emphasise their breasts, and breasts are often emphasised in erotic scenes on Athenian vases (Robson, 2013, 121). We have plenty of references to women's breasts in Aristophanes' plays, usually comparing them to fruit and vegetables, such as quinces (*Acharnians* 1198-9; *Assemblywomen* 901-5), apples (*Lysistrata* 155-6), and turnips (*Thesmophoriazusae* 1184-5). These fruit and vegetables are all fairly small, which may be connected to the idea, as expressed in Xenophon's *Memorabilia*, that women with ""plump and soft"" figures were less modest (2.1.22). Women's bums are also praised in Aristophanes' plays (*Lysistrata* 1148; *Peace* 875-6) - although we do not have any foodstuffs to compare them to - suggesting they were also areas of sexual attraction (see this [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bhce8o/hesiod_recommends_against_trusting_women_who/) by u/toldinstone on a mention of 'decorated' buttocks in Hesiod).

A physical attribute that was a focus of the male gaze that women had some control over was their complexion. Being pale had long been a female quality that had been highly appreciated in Greek culture as it was effectively a mark of a woman's place within the household - ""a modest and chaste upper-class woman had no need to expose herself to the sun by straying from the house or working outside"" (Robson, 2013, 119). Women had some control over their complexion thanks to cosmetics. While cosmetics are usually referenced in Aristophanes in connection to old women who are trying to hide their age (*Assemblywomen* 878, 928, 1072), makeup is included in Lysistrata's arsenal of attraction (149-154):

>If we sat around at home all made up, and walked past them wearing only our diaphanous underwear, with our pubes plucked in a neat triangle...

This reference, coupled with the fact that white makeup has been found among funerary goods in several graves, suggests that makeup was widely used. However, Xenophon, in his *Economics*, provides the main discussion from Classical Greece of the appeal of cosmetics to men (or, in this case, the lack of appeal). The elite Athenian Ischomachus tells his wife, after he finds her wearing makeup, that men prefer women to look natural (10.2-8). While this passage does seem to be a definitive description of men's attitudes to makeup, it should be remembered that this is very much Xenophon's opinion, and it was more likely that he was writing in response to the widespread use of cosmetics (see Glazebrook, 2009). In Lysias' speech *On the Murder of Eratosthenes*, we learn that Euphiletus is concerned that his wife is wearing makeup, but only because her brother had recently died (1.14), but it is later suggested that his wife was wearing makeup because she was trying to appear more attractive to her lover (1.17). Makeup was usually white lead and a red blush made of alkanet root (see Glazebrook, 2009, 235-7). It seems that makeup was widely used to alter women's complexion.

As Lysistrata's list above notes, diaphanous (see-through) clothes, and pubic hair plucking were also ways women could make themselves appear more attractive. Given that elite Athenian women were expected to go about veiled (see Llewellyn-Jones, 2003, 23-83) and that women's typical clothing were the loose-fitting *peplos* or *chiton*, wearing see-through clothing was likely a risque social transgression that would essentially capture a husband's attention, much like lingerie today. As for pubic hair plucking, this is a bit more complicated. There are references to women attending to their pubic hair, whether singeing hair (Aristophanes, *Lysistrata* 824-8) or plucking (*Frogs* 512-521; *Lysistrata* 149-154). While Lysistrata does describe women plucking their pubic hair into a triangle, and there are artistic representations of this style, there are also representations of women with no pubic hair. It is possible that the difference in styles in art was meant to represent differences in age (Robson, 2013, 122), but it is also possible that there were simply different styles in Athens.

The last way to make oneself appear more attractive was perfume. In *Lysistrata*, there is a comical scene where a woman attempts to find the correct scent for sex while her sexually frustrated husband gets even more frustrated (938-947), which suggests that men had preferences for the perfume their wives wore. In *Assemblywomen*, another of Aristophanes' plays, a women accused of adultery suggests her husband smell her hair for perfume as proof of her fidelity, to which the husband replies ""cannot a woman possibly be laid without perfume"" (523-5; see also 1117-8). Perfume was certainly considered associated with sex.

There were many ways a wife might make herself more sexually attractive to her husband, and there seems to be very little difference to modern methods. Women wore makeup and perfume, plucked their pubic hair, and dressed in revealing clothing. How often women did this, however, is unknown, as is how successful they were, particularly given the three categories of women given in the speech *Against Neaira*: *hetairai* for pleasure, concubines for sex, and wives for children (Demosthenes, 59.122).

AskHistorians,What was buying groceries like in America 100 years ago?,"100 years puts your year right at 1922, which
is a fascinating one to jump to, as it is
_immediately_ before the first place one might call (in modern terms) a supermarket.

Grocery stores at the time tended to operate
like all others stores at the time -- you walked
in and told the clerk what you wanted, and they
got it for you. (Self-service had been invented
by now, and I'll get to it, but it wasn't
yet the typical experience.)

Product selection was limited, maybe 40 at maximum.
Even in a very large chain -- at this time the
king was Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company
-- while they had 300+ unique items they were
mainly different varieties of tea and coffee. This meant,
yes, shopping took a while, and you did have
to stop at a variety of places: butchers
for meat, green grocers for fruit and vegetables, cheese shops for cheese,
bakers for bread, and hunting food was sometimes
an adventure involving finding the right pushcart.  (If the grocer did have any extra goods, it tended to be a fruit and vegetable selection -- but this depended on location and availability.)
For the grocers that would eventually transform
into supermarkets, they tended to deal in
non-perishables; the 10s and 20s were a popular time for
canned goods. This [Your Grocery Store](https://archive.org/details/yourgrocerystore1918sear/page/40/mode/2up?view=theater)
catalog as published by Sears in 1918 can give you something
of an idea; the ""Potted and Canned Meats"" includes
""Chicken a la King"", ""Veal Loaf"", and
""Pickled Pigs' Feet, Montclair Brand.""

One of the more interesting twists to 1920s shopping
is that the late-19th century had something of
a downturn in the public market. A 1913 meeting
of city leaders gave a grim prognosis, with one
speaker saying cemeteries were spent on vs.
markets at a 2 to 1 ratio:

>...more, that is, on resting places for the dead than on food buying facilities for the living.

New York in 1912 had a population of 5 million, with
a single (small) market. The method of solving this was
the so-called ""terminal markets"", being a market
built near a rail terminal (or at a waterway) that would allow rapid
distribution; it was otherwise too hard for
urbanites to purchase direct from the source. Several
of these markets were built in the 1920s, but in
1922 a New York urbanite still had to struggle to find if they wanted fresh fruit and vegetables, and in general, the urbanite level of eating such was low.

It was extremely common to not pay right away but to keep an account, paid at (for example) the end of the month. This could be distressing for the retailers who couldn't always collect.  Quoting _The Progressive Grocer_ (volume 1, 1922), giving a grocer's method for dealing with a non-paying customer:

>So I sent him a bill -- plain bill, in an ordinary envelope. Two days later I sent him another bill, in a plain envelope. Two days later I sent him a bill, special delivery. Two days later I  sent him a bill by registered mail. He had to sign for the latter, of course. In other words, I made _him_ know that _I_ knew he _had_ received the bills. Just that and nothing more.

Quoting an oral history:

>...the grocery guys would make a list of your needs from your phone call and go through the store gathering your order for the home delivery service, and even then, no money changed hands. It was paid for later.

which indicates one other element common at the time: delivery service. It was not uncommon for a grocer to have cars at the ready to make home deliveries. This was only made obsolete with the rise of parking lots and self-service.

Speaking of self-service:

Counter service was especially problematic for manufacturers, as
it was often the case a person would ask for something
generic, and get steered to the more expensive brand;
manufacturers might try to carefully roll out new products
but have retailers essentially unwilling to push them, since
they were a buffer to the customer. It wasn't necessarily a
great deal for the customer, either, who could be talked
into spending for a higher-cost item or simply bilked outright with
a higher price than intended by the manufacturer (so the retailer
could pocket the difference).

However, the innovation of self-service came from the retail end, reducing the amount of labor from clerks and making a better experience for customers; the Economy Grocery Store Company in 1912 tested it first, and there were simultaneously some self-service stores developing in California. Piggly Wiggly, founded by Clarence Saunders, didn't open their first store until after. There are some histories that claim they were the first; they _popularized_ the concept but were not the first. Sticking with the Piggly Wiggly, though, as they have a [well-illustrated patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US1242872A/), the shopper would pick up a basket upon entering, then pass through arranged aisles and be able to pick up the items they wanted. Clerks could still do salesmanship and suggestive shopping, but they were able to devote more time to stocking and window displays.

Piggly Wiggly's success was so enormous it while a self-service experience would not have been the _most common_ it would not have been hard to find. By 1922 the store was famous; there were over 1000 stores with the name, many of them licensing as franchises. (Some of the grocers started to fail, and consequently there ended up being a battle of short sellers at Wall Street vs. Clarence Saunders, but that's a saga for a much different question.)

As I hinted at earlier, 1922 really didn't have anything like a supermarket yet (Piggly Wiggly has been referred to as a ""proto-supermarket""); that would have
to wait until November 1923, with Henke & Pillot
in Houston. They had a baker in the store; they
also had a butcher and fishmonger. They worked on bringing ""year-round""
products (which were still quite seasonal at the time) and had an enormous space to work with at 30,000 square feet. Henke and
Pillot brought the number of products to
_thousands_. The 1920s brought many ""combination
stores""; if not going all the way, at least having
an in-store butcher, preparing the way for the
full-fledged supermarket boom in the 1930s.

AskHistorians,"Why is the interior of pyramids still not fully explored? Shouldn't it be possible to explore them with the help of modern technology, such as infrared?","**Part 1**

I want to add in a bit of information on some of the methodological and institutional limitations of these types of projects from an archaeologist. There are dozens of limitations. I do want to point out, I don't know how much of the pyramid itself has been studied and how much of the estimated possible space has been studied.  It could be that 99% of the spaces are known and are in some state of research or analysis but we only see the most sensationalized accounts.

1. **Fragmentation -**   Archaeology is essentially a different discipline within each country and even within each country it can differ greatly.  There isn't a lot of work on this but if anyone is keen on seeing some of the differences you can look at the [*Discovering the Archaeologists of Europe*](https://landward.eu/disco/) survey from 2014. It's mostly superficial but gets at the broader part of the problem.  There are differences at the most basic levels of archaeology, our methods, theories, tools and technologies, even the definition of what archaeology is.  This makes it difficult to collaborate on a larger scale and collaborate internationally, get proper funding, overcome limitations like health and safety, and limits our accessibility to new technologies. Any project will find it difficult to get access to new or innovative technologies like this, even if it is the pyramids.
2. **Manpower -** Archaeology is a very very small field, it is estimated that there are only 60,000 archaeologists worldwide.  I'd say it's closer to 80,000 but it is a problematic estimation and based on the numbers, roughly 10-15% of those are in academic or research positions so maybe 12,000 academic archaeologists worldwide.  The only consistency in defining what an archaeologist is around the world is that they have a bachelors degree. In most countries, roughly 99% of those who work professionally (based on those surveys from above) have at least a bachelors degree.  That is problematic for reasons I won't be able to get into but briefly because there are a lot of volunteers, students, and laborers who don't have degrees but should be qualified as archaeologists for the work that they do.  The higher estimation is based on percentage of eligible individuals in the workforce and the average number of archaeologists as a percentage of population per country based on the above survey.  
This is a long winded way of saying that there aren't enough archaeologists to do the work.  Egypt's old [Supreme Council of Antiquities](https://tinyurl.com/yjy673dm) suggested in 2011 that it had 40,000 permanent employees and 15,000 temporary employees, who knows what that number is now. I'm not familiar with Egyptian archaeology but it's likely that most of those people are administrators or not involved with archaeology itself. Either way, it is a limited number of people meant to be dealing with an entire nation's worth of heritage and a nation that has so much of it to begin with.  
This has a big impact on research and development as archaeologists are usually desperately low on time and funding which leads us to do everything ourselves or wait for others to do it.  Some of that is ego but a lot of it is because we haven't professionalized our field so we waste time and money constantly redoing the same things, building databases, recording systems, redefining some part of archaeology, working on outreach, grants, running our websites, teaching, etc.  Our time to devote to research and development is limited.  When it comes to research and development, we still do it but usually on an individual level and usually as part of PhD research where it doesn't get widely disseminated or used unless it's part of a huge project that gets a lot of attention (hence the sensationalizing of a lot of projects).  That 12,000 number is likely much much lower in terms of people actually working on these types of innovations.  Judging from departments and conference topics it's probably closer to 4,000 - 5,000 archaeologists working on these types of technological innovations *worldwide* but that's purely speculation.
3. **Funding -** Archaeology no matter how important or how impressive the site, is chronically underfunded.  Our groups, universities, companies, non-profits, everything is in such a wildly complicated and complex fragmented state where we unnecessarily compete against each other for funding.  There are so many companies and organizations doing the same damn thing and separating out what little time and funding we have.  The group that is undertaking this project is a perfect example of this issue, which I'll get to in a second. First, and this feeds into the previous issue of manpower, there are constant efforts to [monitor heritage sites](https://tinyurl.com/yck49cdn) but there is just so much of it. I don't know what Egyptian laws are but most European countries along with North American countries have established basic laws and conventions like the [Valetta Convention](https://tinyurl.com/2dxh8da4).  These establish that archaeology and heritage needs to be assessed, preserved, and recorded to some level before it is likely damaged by development and construction.  This is such a complicated, underfunded, and underdeveloped part of heritage management and archaeology that has archaeologists spread too thinly world-wide.  It's made so much worse in places like Egypt, Greece, or Italy where they have so many sites and archaeological material everywhere and constant development efforts.  I don't know how up to date the number is, but in pyramids alone Egypt has *at least* [118](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids#cite_note-1).  They need to fund research, analysis, and preservation of all of that and a huge range of other projects beyond those typical periods.That means that even though the Great Pyramids are so widely admired and there's such a desire to understand them, they are likely underfunded.  The [ScanPyramids](http://www.scanpyramids.org/index-en.html) project which is part of the [Heritage Innovation Preservation Institute](http://www.hip.institute/) looks to be primarily externally funded with **25 different partners and sponsors.** I  know very little about this organization and the project, they were only established in 2015 and the have little to no information available which means they're another one of hundreds of similar organizations and groups trying to do this type of '3D' or 'non-invasive' research.  Their [one publication](https://tinyurl.com/448krmnd) does not acknowledge any funders and their website is frustratingly vague.  I don't really want to get into the specifics of it and won't argue that the science and technology are cool and innovative but the overall project is a little sketch and missing a lot of information. Primarily the lack of any information on the teams aside from the 3 founding members, none of whom are involved with archaeology or heritage in any meaningful way is sketchy and, unfortunately, a problematic and common occurrence in archaeology and heritage.

AskHistorians,"Greek gods are often referred to as being ""the God of X"" (War, Love, Revenge). Did the Greeks themselves actually catalogue their gods this specifically, or is this a simplification applied by historians?","I'm still a student in the subject so if any experts come along with more complete answers I would recommend their's over mine, but I can at least point out a few things.

While the modern idea of the Hellenic gods often attributes a single, specific sphere of influence (Athena for wisdom, Zeus for Justice, Poseidon for the Sea, etc.) it was more complex than this and the gods had multiple 'duties', for instance Poseidon was also regularly associated with horses, earthquakes and many other areas. With such a vast list of duties, crossovers and muddled areas where multiple gods were attributed to the same field are inevitable and ways of distinguishing which element of the god you required became very important. As the comment here on Athena Promachos (I like to translate it as Athena of the Front Lines) demonstrates: the gods were often attributed epithets to indicate which element of the god's influence was being called upon. Zeus, for instance, while being more generically known as the king of the gods, the god of justice, or the god of the sky was also a god of marketplace deals/oaths (Zeus Agoraios), a god related to Athenian phratries (Zeus Phratios), the god of Xenia and the customs of treating guests, etc. All of these epithets represented different sides of the same deity, however, they would often be represented differently depending upon the epithet. The best example of this would be Athena's statues on the Acropolis, the main large bronze statue was of Athena Promachos, she was appropriately armed with her spear, shield and helmet to show the martial nature. Whereas another statue found in the Erechtheion was of Athena Polias (Athena the protector of the city), although we have no archaeological remains of this statue (as even in the 5th century this wooden statue was considered ancient and I have seen some suggest it may have been carved as far back as the Mycenaean period) it is often assumed that it emphasised more peaceful and feminine traits such as golden jewellery, a libations bowl, and a lack of weapons and armour.

You may be thinking that this could get confusing or overwhelming with the many epithets each god held and you would not be alone in this, one of the questions regularly asked of prophets and oracles by the ancient Greeks was which god and which aspect of a god should they pray to in a specific circumstance. For instance if you planned to open a stall in the Agora would you make a sacrifice to Hermes, who is considered the god of traders, or to Zeus Agoraios?. An example of this can be found in Xenophon's Anabasis (3.1.5 - 3.1.8) in which he consulted the oracle of Delphi as to which god he should offer his prayers to for a naval expedition.

The direct answer to your question is a resounding ""kind of"", there were specific focuses of gods which were more well known, however, there was a much deeper and more nuanced collection of epithets which demonstrated a far broader focus than a simple ""God of War"", ""God of Wine"" etc. These were undoubtedly major parts of their sphere of influence, but they did not represent all that they stood for. All of this is without even mentioning the differences between the more universal influences of gods, which all of the Greek world recognised and prayed to, and the more local/personal cults which could differ wildly in focus and may only be celebrated in one region, one polis, or one family. As with most popular ideas there is a nugget of truth but the answer is far more complicated and nuanced.

AskHistorians,"Everybody - not just historians - knows about Columbus, Cleopatra, Da Vinci and Lincoln. They're the celebrities of history. What are come examples of such historical ""Celebrities"" that used to be globally known, but faded away from collective memory?","I think the best single example might be Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). 

Andrea Wulf’s excellent *The Invention of Nature* is essentially a book-length answer to this question. The German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt was a super-celebrity in his day and for decades thereafter, but barely remembered now. His funeral was the largest ever accorded to a private individual in Germany. More than a hundred animal species are named after him, in addition to mountains or mountain ranges on every continent, various plants and minerals, more and more than a dozen towns and counties throughout North America. The centennial of his birth attracted some of the largest mass demonstrations in the world, including a crowd of 25,000 in Central Park alone. *Humboldt* was even briefly considered as the name of the state we call Nevada. 

Why Humboldt was so universally acclaimed and why he has subsequently fallen into such obscurity comes down to the universality of the principles of natural science he established. Humboldt was an explorer and naturalist in a time when the natural sciences were still in their infancy, often seen as the lesser spin-offs of pursuits like philosophy and literature. Humboldt travelled the world and developed ideas that are so fundamental to our understanding of nature that it is at times surprising that anyone needed to come up so the them. Namely, Humboldt was the first to popularize the idea that similar environments tend to produce similar forms of life. That is, there is a reason why the flowers found in northern Sweden, southern Patagonia, and the Tibetan Plateau tend to have certain similarities, even though these areas are far apart and the plants in question are not closely related. Humboldt was the first to conceive of what we would now call ecotopes- the idea that coniferous forests in Oregon and Korea have more in common with one another than either do with their neighboring plains. 

Humboldt fell out of popular consciousness in part because these ideas have become so fundamental to our understanding of nature that their discovery can seem inevitable. Few people would build a statue of, for example, the first person to say the sky was blue (while he was not the first to say this, Humboldt did often measure the blueness of the sky with a device called a cyanometer). His ideas were so successful that it fell to later naturalists such as Charles Darwin to make the controversial leaps of reasoning that embed them in our cultural memory today. Moreover, anti-German sentiment in the early 20th century led the English speaking world with its vast global reach in publishing and opinion-making to disfavor Humboldt and privilege its own naturalists. 

Today, Humboldt is little known outside of Germany, and even there his memory is often overshadowed by his brother Wilhelm, the celebrated philosopher for whom Humboldt University in Berlin is named.

AskHistorians,"Serbia recently had its first prototypical ""American-style"" school-shooting where one teenager murdered several of his classmates. How long have things like this been happening; calculated, indiscriminate child-on-child mass murder in a schooling context, seemingly without clear motive?","(**CONTENT WARNING**: violence.)

So I need to preface by saying: if something like this happened during Shakespeare's time, you'll need to find a different expert. 

Of the school violence events we have in the 19th century, though, the pattern is specific and individual; sometimes shockingly violent, but not in a random sense. There were both accidents and intentional violence carried out.

For an accident: consider the court case _Bullock v. Babcock_, New York, from 1828, which was related to an incident a decade earlier in 1816.

Babcock (the defendant) was 12 and Bullock (the plaintiff) was between aged somewhere 9 and 10. They were playing near their school house with a bow and arrow, shooting at a target. A ""remark"" (not recorded exactly) had been made by Bullock; Babcock's response was to say ""I will shoot you"" and take the bow and arrow another boy  had been using one. Bullock ran into the schoolhouse and hit; Babcock followed, reportedly saying

>See me shoot that basket.

at which point Bullock had brought his head up at the exact wrong moment,
and was hit square in the eye. The boy became blind in that eye
and ended up not being able to attend school for five years.

The jury found for the plaintiff for damages by negligence, for shooting the arrow in a room full of boys was dangerous, but it was not by any means considered an intentional wounding.

For intentional: Consider the case of Professor Butler, teacher at a school
in Louisville, KY. 1853. One particular student, Willie, (of the wealthy Ward family) ""after repeated provocation"" was ""chastised"" (that is, whipped).

Shortly after, the student's brother, Matthew F. Ward, bought a self-cocking pistol from a gun-shop; he later bought a second, and then put both in his coat. He told his mother he was going to get an apology from Mr. Butler. His mother asked him to take his older brother Robert. Robert came along with a bowie-knife, and the two brothers went to talk to Butler in the middle of class, demanding an explanation about Willie's treatment. Butler said he could take things in private, but Matthew demanded a conversation then and there, eventually resulting in him calling Butler a ""damned scoundrel and coward"". At this, Butler hit Matthew twice; Matthew responded by drawing one of his pistols and firing it ""at his breast"".

Butler died; Matthew (being struck first) incidentally ended up being acquitted.

There are other stories of violence but they tend to involve a quarrel, and not random victims.
The earliest incident I know of in a senseless, random sense is from a New York Times article dated April 10, 1891, where the 70 year old James Foster fired a shotgun as some children in front of St. Mary's Parochial School, New York.

>None of the children were killed, but several were well filled with lead.

We can find sporadic reports passing through the 20th century of attempted mass murder, both school focused and not, the most horrid being the Bath, Michigan incident of 1927; Andrew Kehoe, 55, who was upset about losing a town clerk election, first murdered his wife then set off bombs at Bath Consolidated School; when rescuers drove up to help, he drove up in a truck and blew himself and some of the adults up, the sum total of his attacks leading to 38 dead children and 6 dead adults.

Now, the question was specific as to wondering about random violence perpetrated by a teenager _and_ at a school. For that my reckoning we have to go to November 1966 and Robert Benjamin Smith, and two events earlier that year that need to be mentioned to understand what happened in November.

This is because Robert was a big fan of two people: Richard Speck and Charles Whitman.

On a single night in Chicago, July 13, Richard Speck stabbed and strangled 8 women that he held in a room, bringing them out one by one to murder.

Not long after, August 1st, Charles Whitman went on a murder spree eventually culminating with him climbing a clock tower at University of Texas at Austin and firing at people at random. He left a suicide note:

>I do not really understand myself these days ... I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.

An autopsy was performed on Whitman after and he was found to have a brain tumor, suggesting mental illness. Speck also was diagnosed, with the psychiatrist Dr. Ner Littner testifying about ""chronic personality disorder, with neurotic features"". Speck also claimed heavy influence from drugs and alcohol. 

While neither case is definitive for mental illness, at least in neither sense was either men trying for glory. Robert Benjamin Smith, aged 18, was trying for glory.

Robert's early heroes were Caesar, Napoleon, and JFK, with JFK being his favorite. After JFK's assassination he asked his father to attend his funeral and was declined. He eventually started getting fascinated with Oswald especially, and grew a streak for admiring murder. When the horrendous events of the summer of 1966 happened, he knew he had a mission.

He considered his own high school (at this time in Mesa, Arizona), but instead decided on  Rose-Mar College of Beauty, which he decided would have more potential to do harm (especially on women, as his hero Speck did). He chose Saturday morning, which was normally full: instead, there were only 6 women. He gave a shot in the air and ordered them to be face-down.

I'll pass over the details from here, but I will say at least that there was one survivor, Tammy Lynn Sellers (3 months old) who was protected by the body of her mother.

When police came he let them know he ""shot some people"" and that the gun was in a sack. He later said he was ""disappointed"" with the number of deaths. He wanted to be famous. He wanted to kill 40 people.

It is very tempting, for those hoping for explanation, to leap upon the media-fame aspect: while it was possible to be a famous murderer in the 19th century (see: Jack the Ripper) the media multiplier brought by television made things more intense. However, there are plenty of other profiles with varying factors, out of the teen-aged murderers from before and after. Michael Andrew Clark killed three people in a sniper spree of 1965, shooting cars (just _not_ at a school, as the question specifies). In 1974, the teenager Branimir Donchev Delchev (of Sofia, Bulgaria) watched _The Godfather_ with some friends and became paranoid afterwards about being followed; the events later led to 8 people dying. He was later found insane with ""schizophrenic psychosis"". Each instance has its own factors (including, yes, access to guns). But in general, we can say the instances that follow the specifics of the question (in a schooling context) start with 1966.

AskHistorians,Ancient Athens seems to have lacked the apartment buildings of ancient Rome. So did most people live in small single-family homes? Should we imagine these as row houses? What would the living situation be like for the working poor and middle class? Were there slums?,"This was a very interesting question to research.

Domestic archaeology in Athens is way behind that of the major sites, such as the acropolis and the agora, for several reasons. For one, the bigger sites were deemed 'more important' than domestic architecture, more central to our understanding of the city-state of ancient Athens. Another reason is that, well, Athens is still lived in, and it is a very large city. The presence of modern buildings that go right up to the base of the acropolis and surround the other major archaeological sites makes it incredibly difficult to undertake archaeological digs in modern residential areas. When digs are undertaken, there is no guarantee that Classical Athenian houses will be discovered for, in antiquity, many houses were cleared to make way for building projects, from new temples to new houses. ""The cycles of building and rebuilding from antiquity to the present have greatly limited our ability to understand earlier domestic architecture"" (Harrington, 2021, 126).

Even if a domestic structure was found, the evidence suggests that we would have difficulty determining social class from the ruins. Demosthenes, in his third *Olynthiac*, says that ""they \[fifth-century Athenians\] were so modest... that the houses of their famous men, of Aristides or of Miltiades, as any of you can see that knows them, are not a whit more splendid than their neighbors"" (Dem. 3.25-26, trans. J.H. Vince, 1930). Upon first glance, this reads much like rhetorical hyperbole, but as Harrington writes, relating to this quote, ""archaeological evidence suggests that Classical and Early Hellenistic Athenian houses were not typically elaborate"" (2021, 125). We should bear in mind, however, that wealthy Athenians, such as Aristides and Miltiades, would have had at least one farm outside the city (see Xenophon, *Economics* 11.15; Lysias 1.11). Wealthy Athenians also likely owned more than one house in the city (see, for example, Isaeus 5.11; 8.35). Moreover, Miltiades had significant holdings abroad, being the tyrant of the Thracian Chersonese (Hdt. 6.34-41, 103).

The term *synoikiai* (lit. 'together-dwellings') is thought to denote some kind of apartment dwelling. According to Aeschines, there appears to have been no architectural difference between these apartment buildings and single-family houses (1.124). As such, it is likely that, much like modern landlords turn old houses into apartments, *synoikiai* were single houses that were divided into smaller sections to accommodate more occupants. We have plenty of references to wealthy Athenians owning *synoikiai*, such as Pasion the banker (Demosthenes 36.34; 45.28), Dicaeogenes (Isaeus 5.26-27), Euctemon (Isaeus 6.19-20), and Aphobus, Demosthenes' guardian (Demosthenes 29.3).

There are also references to people with multiple houses renting them out, presumably to less wealthy Athenians. A man called Ciron is said to have had two houses in the city, one of which he rented out to a tenant (Isaeus 8.35). The Old Oligarch (often identified as Pseudo-Xenophon) writes of how, when foreigners are in Athens, those who have lodgings to rent out do so (*Athenian Constitution* 1.17).

As for slums, I do not know how permanent they were in the urban fabric of Athens, but, during the Peloponnesian War, when the people of Athens fled within the city's walls, there was certainly a slum established. According to Thucydides, the majority of Athenians lived in the country before the Peloponnesian War (2.16), which gives the impression that the city was not suited to housing so many people. Indeed, Thucydides tells us that, in addition to any uninhabited areas save a few temples, the refugees who did not have townhouses or guest friends settled in the Long Walls (2.17) and he describes their housing as ""stifling cabins"" (2.52, trans. J.M. Dent, 1910; see also Plutarch, *Pericles* 34.4).

So, there were apartment buildings that may have simply been houses divided into smaller dwelling areas, there were people renting whole houses, and, on occasion, at least, there were also slums.

AskHistorians,"Floating Feature: Revolt, Rebellion, Resistance, and Revolution - Protesting through History","So let's talk about mutinies, which have been mythologized all out of proportion by the various theatrical and filmic adaptations of what happened on the _Bounty_, but started in the nature of typical workers' protests (you set your tools down and walked away). 

I wrote about the [mutiny on the Bounty here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6ig3dg/in_reality_was_captain_bligh_really_such_a_cruel/). I'll reproduce my comment below. 

-------- 

*Caveat lector*, I have seen none of these movies, but I have read a bit about Bligh specifically and quite a bit about the contemporary British navy more generally. 

Something to specify at the start of talking about the *Bounty* is that mutinies were not exactly uncommon in the British navy of the era, though the *Bounty* mutiny was highly unusual in several ways. ""Mutiny"" is a word or a concept that seems to have gained power over time -- early mutinies that we have recorded in the English/later British navy seem to have been more in the order of work stoppages or ""walkouts"" to use an anachronistic term. Men would mutiny over pay and victuals, sure, but also over what they saw as violations of their traditional prerogatives or rights, or even objecting to physical punishment from petty officers or especially midshipmen. The mutinies were often dealt with internally on the ship, sometimes by the captain modifying arrangements or coming to an understanding with the crew, and were often not reported to higher authority. But the point of this is that mutinies had traditionally been treated as a problem that required negotiation and compromise. This changed around the time of the American war -- men who had mutinied for fairly traditional reasons (e.g. the crew of the *Defiance* in 1779 objected to a new captain, the men of the *Santa Monica* in 1781 complained of being dealt blows and knocked down by their petty officers, ships in Portsmouth mutinied on paying-off in 1783) were dealt with much more severely and by higher authority than before. This is most easily explained by pointing out that the war forced a (typical) manning crisis on the Navy with the attendant, unpopular press-gangs, and that political tensions were unusually high -- not an environment in which leniency was expected. And though these post-date Bligh's unfortunate affair, the violent reaction to the mutinies at Spithead and the More in 1797 and the hunting down of the *Hermione* mutineers after the event in that same year suggested that tensions, and therefore state violence, were both on the rise. 

Anyhow, to your actual question: Bligh was not more physically violent than other contemporary captains -- he was not physically violent, and he ordered fewer floggings of his men (both in absolute and relative terms) than any other British captain in the Pacific in the 18th century. Vancouver flogged 45 percent of his men; Cook's voyages ranged between 20 and 37 percent of his men; and Bligh flogged 19 percent and 8 percent in two voyages. Where Bligh's abuse of his men came in was in various non-physical cruelties, threats, and even poor money-lending practices that undermined his authority. (Bligh had lent Christian money when they were in False Bay reprovisioning, and held it over his head later.) Bligh was never a consistent leader, and his erratic nature fueled some of the seamen's discontent throughout the voyage -- he treated Christian, for example, almost as a favorite or protege at times, rating him acting lieutenant (though not changing his position on the ship's books) and angrily berating him over small, supposed slights at other times. The ship's surgeon was a useless drunk, and when he botched bleeding a patient who later died of blood poisoning, Bligh went slightly off the rails and started administering his own personal antiscorbutic medicine, standing his crew in a line so he could watch the men swallow it. He also forced them to skylark on deck after supper -- this is one of the social rituals that was generally a way to blow off steam and work out small tensions throughout the workday, but in this case it started to have a feeling of compulsion about it, especially when he cut two men's grog who would not dance. (This has echoes of the dark humor of ""the floggings will continue until morale improves.) 

When the *Bounty* actually made it to Tahiti, discipline was again severely relaxed. (This yo-yoing between relaxed and severe discipline did severe damage to the ordinary social contract on board.) The men lived openly with Tahitian women ashore, traded with them for breadfruits, and (perhaps unsurprisingly) either stole or allowed to be stolen items from the ship (particularly iron items) that could be exchanged for food, souvenirs or sexual favors. Bligh was enraged by this and publicly berated his officers (including Christian) in front of both their sailors and the Tahitians, further undermining his own authority; and started to attempt again to enforce harsh discipline, including floggings. When they left Tahiti, morale seems to have been stable, but Bligh had again began to berate the crew and behave unpredictably. When the ship stopped in Nomuka, Bligh put Christian in charge of a watering party but denied him use of the ship's muskets; the inhabitants of Nomuka were unfriendly and prevented Christian from watering, whereupon Bligh cursed him on the deck as a coward -- an insult that would in other contexts have led to a duel among people of equal standing. Bligh went on to accuse Christian of stealing coconuts from his private pantry, and cut the whole crew's rum ration in retaliation. This seems to have been the proverbial last straw for Christian, who seized the ship the next morning and put Bligh in an open boat with 18 men who stayed loyal. (He subsequently sailed the boat nearly 4,000 miles to Timor, an astonishing navigational feat.) 

> I don't know, but I find it hard to believe that a mutineer (Christian) was acting purely for honorable reasons, and that Bligh was motivated by greed and power and had no regard whatsoever for his men.

Christian wasn't acting for honorable reasons; he has been described as a ""weak and unstable young man who could not stand being shouted at"" (Rodger, *The Command of the Ocean* p.405). That seems to be a pithy way to summarize the issue -- he was not a well-trained seaman and had little natural authority of his own, but Bligh similarly failed to establish consistent discipline on board. 

Bligh was an outstanding seaman but a terrible administrator (his sailors mutinied under him again as part of the larger Spithead mutiny, and then men under his command mutinied when he was governor of New South Wales). He apparently had an ungovernable temper (but, again, was demonstrably not more physically cruel than contemporary captains)  and did several things on the voyage to undermine his own authority -- notably, putting himself in conflict with his men by acting as his own purser; moving from his sea cabin to a small cabin next to where the men slept (his cabin was filled with breadfruit trees); promoting and then berating his lieutenant and the other petty officers; and generally poor discipline."

AskHistorians,"The 1931 film Frankenstein begins with a warning to the audience that the studio thinks it's too scary, and audiences might be shocked. Was this merely a marketing gimmick, or did Universal truly believe that the film was so scary compared to other films that it warranted a warning to audiences?","It was a marketing stunt, and hardly the first of its kind.

Epes W. Sargent wrote a column called ""Selling the
Picture to the Public"" starting in 1911, followed by
the books *Picture Theatre Advertising* (1915) and *Building
Theatre Patronage* (1927). The former book contains relatively
tame advice for drawing a crowd for film publicity, 
except for the bit where it suggests to give away a baby.

>Advertise that on a certain day, well in
advance, you will give a baby to a person
to be decided upon. Make a big display of the fact
in your advertisements. If no one else does, get
some friend of yours to write the papers denouncing
the inhumanity of the act.

The idea was to drum up attention (""so much the
better"" if the police get involved) before the
eventual climax where you bring out a baby pig dressed
in clothes.

This was the age of circuses and the legacy of Barnum. The more outrageous the claim the better. Another early
technique was ""wish news"", trying to create fake stories that somehow increase the intrigue of
a particular story; there was an ad in 1910 (""We Nail a Lie"") denouncing the hoax about the
star Florence Lawrence's death. The problem is, there was no such hoax to begin with; the ad
was the first time any such thing was mentioned!  Nevertheless the seed of the hoax was planted, and
it allowed later headlines like ""GEM THEATER FLORENCE LAWRENCE NOT DEAD - See her here in
today's motion pictures.""

The actual showing itself was meant to create an environment, not just be a movie theater. The theater
was often decorated heavily to emphasize the theme; think of the ""dressed up"" lines leading into a modern
Disney ride. With an early version of *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* the lobby was ""split"" with a horror theme on 
one side and romance on the other; it was reported at the time this was successful enough that it made the 
movie one of the highest grossing of the year. 

For horror specifically, there were staged faintings (and in one case, a real fainting at a viewing of _King Kong_ 
where a woman fainted at the sight of a man in a gorilla suit). 

As far as _Frankenstein's_ warning goes, something similar dates back to _Nosferatu_, the 1922 vampire classic (which
was nearly destroyed by a Bram Stoker estate lawsuit when negatives were ordered destroyed, but fortunately for modern
audiences copies survived). Advertisements warned ""It's Only A Movie ..."" and the movie came with a message that

>Nosferatu is not just fun, not something to be taken lightly.

_Frankenstein_ just copied the same type of shtick, augmented:

>So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to -- uh well, we warned you.

In his 1927 book, Sargent suggests placing ambulances outside the theater, their presence outside a horror theater suggesting
a grim outcome for the viewers. _Dracula_ used this trick. [Here's a picture of an ambulance at a showing of *Frankenstein*](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/df/b5/4e/dfb54e1c906dce2ee1bdbc7a8029460c.jpg) (complete with nurses); Universal had the lobby dressed with sinister medical devices.

AskHistorians,Did Rome have any concept of war crimes? Things that soldiers were forbidden by their laws from doing in battle.,"Before we answer anything we first have to define what exactly constitutes a '*war crime*'. The Hague and later Geneva Conventions + Protocols provide a definition, sure, but we cannot reasonably apply a modern understanding of what constitutes a violation of the 'rightful' rules of war to ancient conflict. So for the purposes of this answer, I'll consider war crimes **a deliberate attack upon a force, civilian, para- or military, which has either expressed a desire to surrender or is no longer capable of effective resistance.**

I'll address the second part of your question first. 

To my knowledge, there was (or if there was, we do not have it or any references to such a thing) no written 'convention', for lack of a better term, concerning the conduct of a soldier during war. In the first place, the day-to-day life of a soldier is relatively sparse when talking about surviving literature - off the top of my head, I can only name Vegetius as a proper 'troop manual', and there is no discussion of treatment of enemy combatants besides a line that stated:


> 'To debauch the enemy's soldiers and encourage them when sincere in surrendering themselves, is of especial service, for an 
adversary is more hurt by desertion than by slaughter.' (Veg. *Mil.*). 


However one must note that, in the same section (General Maxims), Vegetius also states that:


> 'It is much better to overcome the enemy by famine, surprise or terror than by general actions'. 


While this is *marginally* closer to our definition of war crimes, it is still too far removed to truly be considered an explicit definition of the concept of a war crime.

Which brings us to the first question - *did Rome have a concept of war crimes?*

The short answer, if you're already tired of reading, is: **yes, but:**

 a) the law specifically governed **surrender** and **interstate relationships**, not the treatment of the enemy or any restrictions on the actions of the army, 

b) breaking the rules of war did not necessarily constitute a punishable offense, 

c) what punishments did result are not necessarily solely because of the violation, but likely had political consideration/motivations,

and d) not everyone believed that breaking the rules of war was a negative thing - some even expected to be rewarded.

In Roman policy there exists a concept called **deditio in fidem.** I failed Latin, so I can't precisely translate this myself, but the definition I have seen is 'a dedication in faith' - to put it bluntly, unconditional surrender in good faith. 

This concept is mentioned in several sources - I'll just cite Polybius:

>'committing themselves ""to the faith""​ of the  Romans, not knowing the exact meaning of the phrase, but deceived by the word ""faith"" as if they would thus obtain more complete pardon. But with the Romans to commit oneself to the faith of a victor is equivalent to surrendering at discretion', Polyb. 20.9.12


and Caesar: 

>''surrendered themselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of the Roman people' (Caes. *BGall* 2.3),

>'intimate by their voice that they would throw themselves on his protection and power, nor would contend in arms against the Roman people' (BGall. 2.13), 

> 'resigned themselves and all their possessions to Caesar's disposal' (BGall. 2.31), 

> and 'In the mean time they ordered their people to return to the country parts, and the chiefs assembled from all quarter, and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to Caesar.' (BGall 4.27).

What can we see from these two sources? 

Rome has a definition for what constitutes an 'unconditional surrender'. I haven't put it here, but Caesar was not someone particularly inclined towards the wholesale slaughter of people that could otherwise be useful to him later on. Polybius also provides a definition for how *deditio in fidem* could be misinterpreted. 

However, in both these cases, these govern **diplomacy** and what we would consider **foreign relations** nowadays rather than the explicit behaviour of Roman troops. And as aforementioned, these could be 'flexibly' applied - I will refer to Livy, who describes the brutal manner in which Capua was subjugated despite their surrender after a lengthy siege: 

> 'the only reason why the city was spared was that there might be a place for the tillers of the soil to live in. A motley throng of peasants, freedmen, small tradesmen and artisans were told off to occupy the place; the whole of the territory with the buildings on it became the property of the Roman State. It was settled that Capua itself should be simply a lodgment and a shelter, a city merely in name; there was to be no corporate life, no senate, no council of the plebs, no magistrates; the population were without any right of public assembly or self-government; they had no common interest and were incapable of taking any common action.' (Liv. *Ab urbe condita libri* 26.16, but the previous chapters (26.12-16) are also a good read).

Sallust, in the Bellum Iugurthinum (The War with Jugurtha), mentions that Gaius Marius (who eventually came into conflict with Sulla, and whose reforms laid the groundwork for the transition from Republic to Empire), during the course of the Jugurthine War, ambushed the city of Capsa. Not expecting the Roman attack, the Capsanians (Capsians?) surrendered, but the city was sacked regardless, all the adult males slaughtered, and the remainder sold into slavery. Sallust specifically states here that: 

> 'The consul was guilty of this violation of the laws of war' (Sal. *Iug*. 1.91), 

but then goes on to state that it was: 

> 'not because of avarice or cruelty, but because the place was of advantage to Jugurtha and difficult of access for us, while the people were fickle and untrustworthy and had previously shown themselves amenable neither to kindness nor to fear.'

What we can see here is that it's not necessarily a punishable offence to break the rules of war. So long as it was justifiable, nothing would come of it - and considering Marius' illustrious later career, this clearly had a negligible, if any, impact on the man's fortunes.


So, to wrap up the whole thing, let's restate the question. 

**Did Rome have any concept of war crimes?**

As mentioned before, yes, they technically did. A concept of unconditional surrender was indeed codified into Roman law, and clearly followed by at least one illustrious Roman commander. No actions that would be considered a violation of the definition of war crimes that we have come up with for the purposes of this answer were taken. 

Yet at the same time, not only did this law not govern the specific actions of the Roman army, it also was not legally binding. 

While I have not cited it here, there is an excellent article by Gabriel Baker in MHQ Vol. 32 No. 4 [(I had to pull the article from a random website as I couldn't find the journal in question on short notice)](https://www.historynet.com/crimes-and-consequences-in-ancient-rome/) that goes over three examples of Roman commanders who openly violated the rules of war (explicitly violating the definition of war crimes we are using here), and were threatened with punishment or denied glory in the form of a triumph. Yet these violations did not seem to have a significant effect on the subsequent public lives of these figures, similar to Marius' own violation of the rules."

That's not quite the way they viewed them, of course, and in fact Hamilton and those who eventually evolve into the High Federalists tended to veer towards an ideal where only elites are supposed to be voting, elected, and governing for preferably lifetime tenures.  But what the Founders were well aware of during the Convention were the rotten boroughs of Great Britain, which allowed wealthy, often aristocratic families to control seats in the Commons with at times a few dozen votes.  The most relevant example for them of this was no less than the Prime Minister at the time, William Pitt the Younger, who had tried to get elected to the Cambridge seat, loses, and then convinces a friend who controlled the Appleby borough (with about 100 voters) to give him one of the seats.  Pitt is thus elected at 21 and becomes PM at the ridiculous age of 24.

Given his performance Pitt was probably the best case scenario of this system (and he ironically later in life calls for its elimination), but by and large that kind of rigged control is something the Founders believe that absolutely needs to be avoided in the new government.  This argument doesn't make the Federalist papers, but there were indeed many other lesser known Federalists writing for ratification besides Madison, Hamilton, and Jay; one was [Tench Coxe](https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/idea-of-the-senate/1787DemFederalist_Coxe.htm) of Philadelphia, who does directly address the issue.

>""No ambitious, undeserving or inexperienced youth can acquire a seat in [the Senate] by means of the most enormous wealth, or most powerful connections, till thirty years have ripened his abilities, and fully discovered his merits to his country - a more rational ground of preference than mere property.""

Akhil Reed Amar expands this a bit in *America's Constitution* to argue that there was a wider concern that led to a consensus which viewed age limits as potentially ""limit(ing) the rich and highborn more than the poor and middling classes"" from dominating the new Congress, with doing so a preventative measure against using them as a ""springboard for future offices and honors.""  I'm not entirely convinced of this either being on the minds of the delegates especially given the evolution of the Hamiltonians, but I've also not read enough of what he cites for this line of thought to come down firmly on either side.

But that is what is behind the Article I, Section 2 age limits; you may also find a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10bnhl8/why_was_voter_turnout_for_us_midterm_elections/j4ct4ve/) useful, where I discuss one of the other aspects of it, the long forgotten lowest common denominator property requirement for House elections.

As far as an upper age limit, I can't find anything to suggest that it was discussed at the Convention or for that matter later.  The most relevant part of an older age limit is infirmity and incapability to perform the office, and that is something Congress kept mumbling about from time to time but didn't really didn't start looking into seriously until Wilson's stroke and didn't address until many years later with the 25th Amendment; it was something that Congress was very much concerned about for Presidents but not the rest of the executive, the judicial branch (Taft ended up getting to appoint 5 justices in 4 years largely because the geriatric members of the Supreme Court were in such bad shape by that point that several would fall asleep during arguments), or just as importantly their own body."
AskHistorians,Why is GPS free?,"Oh man! A question I can answer!

I'm a GPS engineer. I'll answer this in a sort of roundabout way by explaining the history of GPS and how it works - then get into why it's used for civil application and why you don't have to pay for it.

GPS was originally a US AirForce program called Navstar. Navstar started in 1973. It was a spiritual follower of other navigation-based programs such as Loran (a 2D positioning system for ships on water), and Decca (a hyperbolic radio navigator based on calculating one's position based on the intersection time of radio signals). These hyperbolic navigation systems were originally started in WW2 to assist bomber runs.

The idea of a space-based version of a navigation system is said to have started with the Soviet launch of Sputnik-1. A group of DoD funded engineers at APL were tasked with figuring out where Sputnik-1 was, and because Sputnik-1 transmitted a continuous waveform, it experienced a measurable doppler shift (if it traveled towards you, it sounded higher pitched - when it passed overhead and continued on, it had a lower pitch). In this way, a group of scientists at APL were able to figure out where Sputnik-1 was! \[1\]

The US DoD then began to investigate new methods for navigating off of radio signals from space *specifically,* eventually leading to Navstar. Navstar as a program was born near the end of Vietnam. During Vietnam, if the US wanted to destroy a bridge, they had to fly sorties over that bridge and drop bombs in the hope that one of those bombs would hit. They had a very high miss rate, caused immense collateral damage, and costed a lot of money because the accuracy of bomb drops was so low (I won't pull a reference for this, but the Thanh Hóa bridge is a great example of this problem). Thus, the Navstar program which would become GPS was implemented to try to resolve the massive challenges associated with target accuracy and navigation.

The Navstar program spent 25 years getting from program inception to final delivery of a full GPS constellation (you need around 30 to navigate, because they're medium-earth orbit globally orbiting satellites, and you need four overhead at any given time to work - it took them a while to get all of those up!) GPS works by resolving the GPS pseudorange equation through trilateration. That is, the satellites transmit two things (broadly): 1) their own precise position, monitored by a group of surveilled ground control monitoring stations around the world, and 2) the precise atomic reference time at which their signals are transmitted using on-board clocks occasionally updated/corrected from the ground. A receiver on the ground has a bad clock and doesn't know where it is, so it resolves a nonlinear equation with four unknowns (it's position in 3 dimensions and its clock error) from the GPS satellites. It's hard to explain without getting into the math, but just know that in this way, all GPS receivers receive very precise timing, as well as their position, by calculating the intersection of four spheres (a great depiction of this is here: [https://ciechanow.ski/gps/](https://ciechanow.ski/gps/)).

During the Navstar program, there was a big push for GPS to be provided as a civil service. For starters, it gave near-atomic clock quality time for next to nothing in cost (you get the benefit of the GPS satellite clocks on your handheld receiver), as well as instantaneous position globally. The timing in particular was a really big deal to the US here - the power grid requires precise timing, the stock market does, etc. The GPS program made all of those things cheaper, better, and easier. So the DoD was always considering *some version* of a civil service for GPS. And then in September, 1983, Korean Airlines Flight 007 accidentally flew through restricted soviet airspace and was shot down, killing 269 people. This was the final incentive that the US needed to publicly provide a GPS civil service.

Another reason that the civil service was allowed was technological. The GPS satellites, which were AirForce assets, transmit a signal called P(Y)-code, which is a military GPS signal with an encrypted code (only military receivers can use it). At the inception of GPS, it could not be directly acquired (doing so required that you knew pretty well where you are), so the Navstar team developed something called ""Coarse Acquisition"", which was *another, worse signal* that could be navigated off of in order to get 'good enough navigation' to get to P(Y)-code. This signal was already being transmitted for military use, and by providing it for civil use, civilian users got a worse version of GPS through C/A. In other words, providing civil use didn't negatively interfere with military use, made stock market and power grid work cheaper (and many other things like public infrastructure development, surveying, etc.).

When they first provided 'free to all' GPS, the AirForce created Selective Availability - a scrambling code on the C/A signal that made it worse than it normally would be (by about 10x). This made C/A GPS 'good enough to navigate off of' but not good enough for military application, as the US was worried about adversaries using it.

In 2000, the US formally turned off Selective Availability, allowing civil use (/u/abbot_x gives a great answer as to why in the comments below). Today, the GPS program is one of the only military programs where civil services (the Department of Transportation, I believe) sits on the stakeholder committee for the  branch that runs it out of AFRL, and they use it for everything. And a lot of other countries have navigation satellite constellations too now (the EU, Russia, China, Japan, and India).

TL;DR: US taxes paid for GPS, but you *really* get access to it because it helps the US government *substantially* in aviation, civil, infrastructure, economic, and military sectors, and the version of GPS that you're using is still substantially worse than the one the military uses. There's some legacy effect here too - the US originally only let civil users use an acquisition code that was never meant for navigation, whereas now they have dedicated civil use signals (mostly due to the intense peer pressure of continued civil reliance).

Recommending a few books that talk about these topics and history in the historical chapters:

1. Kaplan and Hegarty, Understanding GPS/GNSS: Principles and Applications, Third edition
2. Misra and Enge, Global Positioning System: Signals, Measurements, and Performance

Also a good online resource for all things GPS is Navipedia, produced by the European Space Agency but broadly maintained as a wiki (if you want to take a look at more of the math).

Edit: u/victorfencer pointed out that Loran pre-dated Sputnik-1, and I've gone back and checked my textbooks and fixed this. My apologies!

Edit 2: /u/chteme pointed out I should have said surveying, not surveilling (though you know, it's probably applicable to a lot of stuff).

Edit 3: I've gotten a good number of questions about why they turned off SA, and /u/abbot_x gives a great answer below, much better than I would have given, if you want to know more!

Edit 4: Very incredibly kind of all of you. I've got several updates here. 

First, (and I've fixed the post above with this), the GPS trilateration equation is nonlinear, and you can see a great visual of it here: [https://ciechanow.ski/gps/](https://ciechanow.ski/gps/) (somebody posted this and it's very cool and I think their comment got deleted). 

Second, I commented on some major differences between the different constellations here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/13ypf9i/comment/jmql9g2/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/13ypf9i/comment/jmql9g2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

Third, there are a lot of comments regarding time dilation. Fun history fact - the first space-based precursor to GPS was called Transit, and was the first technology that had to actively account for time dilation or stop working, and it assisted in proving Einstein's Theory of Relativity (or perhaps more aptly, continued to prove it). GPS does the same thing! Today it still accounts for time dilation through regular updates to the timing on-board satellites.

Fourth, just as a note to really try to hammer home WHY GPS is free, GPS is estimated to produce $1.4 *trillion* per year in economic gains for private-sector businesses ([https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/10/economic-benefits-global-positioning-system-us-private-sector-study](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/10/economic-benefits-global-positioning-system-us-private-sector-study)). This is in addition to all of the governmental gains in infrastructure, transportation, aviation, power grids, stock markets, good ol' timing, etc. I think part of the trick here is that the US *knew* this would have impact that extended way beyond the already massive military application, and events like Korean Airlines 007 were a straw that broke the camel's back on that discussion. But making it 'free' already saves the US a *ton* of money (both for private and public use) and that more than any other reason is why it's free!"
AskHistorians,Did the generations before us also live with a sense of impending doom and despair about the future or did optimism mostly prevail?,"To my knowledge, optimism about the future seems to be the exception in pre-modern times. In ancient texts, though they seldom discuss the future, they usually view it either as the same as their own time, or as declining further.

An exception to this is praise the current state and ruler, usually for propaganda purposes. An example of this is poets in the Augustan period calling their time a ""new golden age"" and an ""empire without end"".

One idea one sees in a lot of Roman literature is that the morals of the present have declined compared to *mos maiorum*, the ""customs of our elders"", roughly translated. Already in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Cato the Elder complained about the luxuries youths in his time (Polybius, *Histories* 31.25.5; Plutarch, *Life of Cato the Elder* 3.5). Similarly in the Late Republic we find Sallust comparing (*Catiline* 6-12) the virtues of the early Romans with the supposed decadence of his own. You will doubtless see the same sentiment in Cicero, and many writers both before and after their time.

Pliny the Elder, who elsewhere complains about the luxuries brought by conquest and the over-reliance on slaves (N.H. 29.8/19-20; 33.4/26) , even uses this ""decline theory"" when discussing human height in the 7th book of his Natural History:

>It is known that at the age of three a person’s measurement is half his future stature. But it is almost a matter of observation that with the entire human race the stature on the whole is becoming smaller daily, and that few men are taller than their fathers, as the conflagration that is the crisis towards which the age is now verging is exhausting the fertility of the semen... Moreover, nearly a thousand years ago the famed bard Homer  never ceased to lament that mortals were smaller of stature than in the old days  (N.H. 7.16/74 (Loeb transl. with minor edits)

In an example I used in an earlier thread, I quoted from Appian's description of the sacking of Carthage, when Scipio Aemilianus looks upon it and becomes philosophical:

>Going off for a long time to think by himself, and recognizing that a divinity inevitably brings about the fall of cities, nations, and all empires just as of men, and that this is what happened to Troy, once a city blessed by good fortune, and to the empires of the Assyrians and the Medes, and to what became the greatest empire after them, the Persians, and the Macedonians too, the most recent to distinguish themselves brilliantly, he turned to the historian Polybius and spoke the following words, either intentionally or because they escaped his lips*: ""The day will come when sacred Ilium will perish, and Priam, and the people of Priam with his ashen spear*"" When Polybius asked him directly—for he was also his teacher—what he meant by this, they say that **he did not hesitate to name his own country specifically, on whose behalf he was, to be sure, fearful when he looked on the affairs of men**. (Punic War 132; Loeb transl emphasis mine)

It appears that this view continued in the Mediaeval period, when it was combined with the Christian idea that the world was nearing the end times. Though they also had the concept of *translatio imperii*, much like that quote from Appian that greatness has been transmitted from one realm to the other, ending in the writer's own kingdom usually.

(I should also 'ping' u/Timely_Jury who asked a similar question recently)"
AskHistorians,Pasta seems like a perfect food. Vastly superior to regular bread for long-term storage. Versatile and easy to prepare. Why didn’t northern or Eastern Europeans adopt it as a staple the same way the Italians did?,"There's an excellent answer from u/wotan_weevil: https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/s/pYDbXHGREA

I'd like to add that dried pasta making has been done commercially north of the alps since at least the late 18th century, but the missing supply of durum wheat is a big part of why you don't see it. 

I'd also like to point out that grains and potato keep for a long time if stored properly, too, and are also relatively easy to prepare. All of this plays a role in dried pasta being historically less popular north of the alps.

Finally, note that dried pasta is itself pretty much a product of industrialization. Having to perform all steps by hand is much more effort than bread or porridge."
AskHistorians,What were some notorious scams that were done in the time and period you study?,"-Ancient Egypt-
(I study Egyptology)

People went to temples to buy mummyfied cats (ot other animals) in order to stay in the favour of the gods. The Temple would breed kittens just for this. They would be killed to get mummyfied. 

So a Person would come to a temple and would buy a little mummy to be sacrificed to the god of said temple. 

Here is the scam: There has been evidence of some dummy-mummies. The mummy itself would look like a cat or kitten but the insode contained old papyrus scrolls (rubbish/trash) or such that just molded the outsides to look like cats. (My example is about cats but depending on the temple this can also apply to dogs, birds, monkeys etc.) Most likely were these mummies way cheaper than an actual animal, therefore even the less fortunate were able to make sacrifices to the gods.
The cat mummies, real or not, were sometimes even buried in small boxes. There were partially very pretty and even had figures of cats, that sat on top of them.

The example with the cats is located in the huge animal cemetary in the necropolis of Sakkara/Saqqara

AskHistorians,"If a slave owner in 1830's Alabama ordered his slave to commit a crime, who would be punished for the crime and what would the penalty be?","The slaveholder would be faced with criminal conspiracy charges, not much different than when two people conspire to commit a crime today. Generally speaking, the law in the slave states treated enslaved people as property when it benefited free (white) people, particularly the slaveholder. But the law would treat enslaved black people as actual people, rather than as property, whenever it also benefited free (white) people, e.g., when a white person could suffer from the actions of an enslaved person. 

In the case of Alabama in the 1830s, the law was [pretty clear](https://books.google.com/books?id=ejFKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA108&dq=conspiracy+laws+alabama):

> ""If any free person shall be aiding or assisting, or in any wise concerned with any slave or slaves, in any actual or mediated rebellion or conspiracy against the laws, government, or people of this territory ... such free person so offending, and being thereof convicted, shall suffer death.""

That particular statute is really mostly concerned with white people aiding ""slave rebellions"". Nonetheless, there were [cases on the books in Alabama](https://books.google.com/books?id=zy-1AAAAIAAJ&pg=SA615-PA32&dq=conspiracy+laws+alabama) of conspiracy convictions as low as the misdemeanor level. The law treated the conspirator as having committed the same act as the actual perpetrator. So if a white slaveholder conspired with a black enslaved person to commit misdemeanor theft against some other white person, both would be looking at similar misdemeanor sentences. If the crime was murder, both would be facing a death sentence.

It gets a bit more complicated when an enslaved black person was the victim. But going back to the point brought up at the beginning, the crime against another white slaveholder's ""slave property"" would be treated as if the crime was committed against the white slaveholder himself. So, you cheat another enslaved person out of a couple of dollars, the law would treat it as though the conspirators had stolen from the white slaveholder. If it was murder, then it was murder of a white slaveholder's property and, thus, punishable by death.

It gets even more complicated if the victim was a free black person. But by the 1830s in Alabama, it was illegal for free black people to settle within the state anyway. There were some free black people ""grandfathered"" in, but for everyone else, once freed, [they had to leave the state within 30 days](https://books.google.com/books?id=64NPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA396&dq=thirty). Ultimately, there would be little chance of victimizing a free black person in Alabama, since there were so few of them.

But say that it happened. Black people were not allowed to testify in court, [except against other black people](https://books.google.com/books?id=64NPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA391&dq=witness). So, say a white slaveholder and an enslaved black person conspired to murder a free black person. They would be on the hook for the death penalty if some white person could testify to the crime. If only black people could testify to it, then the conspirators might get away with it. If it was theft and the black victim was the only person who could testify to it, then the free black person was not going to prevail in a court of law. 

But of course, the reality is that such a conspiracy against a free black person would hardly ever be necessary. White people could go and steal or even murder a free black person, and unless some white person with a conscience told the police on them, then there would be no possible court case at all. Bringing an enslaved black person into the mix actually made it more difficult for the white people to get away with it, since black victims or witnesses *could* testify against the black perpetrator. But if all the perpetrators were white, and all the witnesses were black, then the courts couldn't even hear the case since there would be nobody who could legally testify in court. 

As for what would be expected of the enslaved person, they would be expected to obey the law even if coerced. Theoretically at least, this left the enslaved person with no good options. Either obey the slaveholder and be on the hook for the sentence for the crime. Or else disobey and suffer the (legal) wrath of the slaveholder, via violence or some other means. 

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that any such thing would go unnoticed. If an enslaved black person were being coerced like that, word would quickly spread to others in the community that the slaveholder was deliberately ordering his ""slave property"" to commit crimes, which was not conducive to keeping the social order intact. The slave states were quite paranoid about slave rebellions, and any hint of any illegal activity by black people would be dealt with swiftly and severely. Their white slaveholders encouraging criminal behavior would be treated by the white community just as harshly."
AskHistorians,Why do old American movies often show Swedish women as ditzy and promiscuous?,"Many removed comments, but I'll give it a shot anyway.

What you describe sounds like what could be described by the ""Swedish Sin"", which I'll try to outline in a timeline of five movies:  
Hon dansade en sommar (1951) (Eng: One Summer of Happiness) - It got a lot of credit when it came out, with a win at the film festival in Berlin, but it also got banned in a long list of countries for showing a nipple^(1); which at the time was much more chocking than it is today. It was as such a start of the idea of Sweden as a place from which ""naughty"" movies came.  
Sommaren med Monika (1953) (Eng: Summer with Monica) - One of the most famous movies by famed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. Also this movie contained a number of scenes that would be seen as tame today, but which at the time were chocking. However, it became even more chocking in the USA where it in 1955 where it was cut down to focus on the ""naughty parts"" and sold as ""Monika: The Story of a Bad Girl"" and it was in 1956 confiscated by Los Angeles vice for being ""indecent""^(2). Finally, it is worth noting that at the same time as it gathered interest, in 1955, so did Time release a famous article named ""Sin & Sweden"", which did further help this image of Sweden^(3).  
Jag är nyfiken (1967) (Eng: I Am Curious) - A movie that in 1969 was the 12th highest grossing movie in the USA and that until the 1990s was the highest ever grossing foreign movie in the USA^(4). Like the previous movies was it, for the time, a rather sexual movie. However, what is more interesting is that it in the case Byrne v Karalexis (1969 & 1971) ended up twice in the US Supreme Court, due to disputes over its obscene nature^(5). So what we have now is a very popular Swedish movie that is in the highest court in the USA, at the forefront of obscenity.  
Svezia inferno e paradiso (1968) (Eng: Sweden: Heaven and Hell) -  I cannot find how big this movie became in the USA, but it is the origin of the song ""Mah nà mah nà"" that you might know from The Muppets. Regardless, it is an Italian ""Mondo film"" and it exotifies Sweden as a place for free sex and largely continue the same idea of Sweden as a place of ""sin"", as such I think it can stand as a good example of a view that existed of Sweden globally at the time.  
Maid in Sweden (1971) - Pure pornography, staring Britt Christina Lindberg who the year who apparently the year before had been the ""Penthouse Pet"" of the month^(6) and who in 1970 also was featured in Playboy (which I will not link due in order to avoid breaking some rule). Noticeable with the movie is that the producer, the director, and the financing of the movie all came from the USA^(7). The reason this movie came when it did was because the wave of pornography that was produced in Sweden at the time did force a legalization of pornography in Sweden early the same year^(8). It is as such a well financed porn movie produced by the USA, one year before the famous American movie Deep Throat and two years before Miller v California result in a liberalization in the USA itself, that was made in Sweden for practical reasons.  


In conclusion, what you have if you look at this timeline of movies is a view in the USA (somewhat justified) of Sweden as a sexually liberal country. As a country in which young people, including young women, have sex because they want to and don't wait until marriage; as it says in the Time article from 1955. It built up during 20 years, it was referred to as the ""Swedish Sin"", and I think it is at least part of why you see that view of Swedish women in American movies in the 1970s (that then lives on).

AskHistorians,What were restaurants like in the USSR ?,"I'm not a historian, but if we're talking about 1975-1985 USSR, I have been there, done that.

So, first of all, people weren't eating out a lot, because it was much cheaper to eat at home. Actually, the structure of life was so different from western way of life, that it's kind of hard to describe. A lot of people in the USSR grew their own vegetables and fruits on *dachas* (*дача*; a small country house with a small field around it) and *ogorods* (*огород*; basically it's the same as dacha, but you don't have any house, just a field). Partly this practice was popular because of money issues, Soviet people weren't rich and didn't have any hope to be. Partly it was the culture, Russian Empire was an agrarian country after all, and a lot of Soviet people also came to cities from villages (or, maybe, not they but their parents).

Also, there weren't a lot of options. And sometimes it didn't worth the money.

**Restaurants** (*ресторан*) were on the high end of the spectrum in terms of price. They were quite expensive, and sometimes you had to *really* wait for your food (like, 30-40 minutes). I don't really know why cooks needed so much time and why they didn't prepare some ingredients beforehand, but it really was an issue. Also, the quality of food usually wasn't very good, you were lucky if it was good enough. Also, prices. You could easily leave on the table 2-10 roubles per person (depending on the amount of alcohol and the restaurant).

(Salaries were mostly 120-200 roubles per month at the time). 

Some of the restaurants were legendary good (in comparison to an average quality level; I'm not sure they would be considered this good by modern standards), but sometimes it was really hard for an average citizen to get inside such restaurant even if he/she had money to leave there. You had to have special connections for that (*блат*), you had to be part of some elite tribe to have an access, if you will. For example, if you wanted to dine in Moscow *Ресторан при ЦДЛ* you had to be a writer or a friend of some writer (and it was the only Moscow restaurant at the time that was allowed to buy fresh dill and parsley on the markets instead of shops). Some of such restaurants formally were more open, but it was hard to get into because '*sorry, all our tables are reserved*'. Some of them were relatively accessible.

But the majority of the restaurants weren't as good or as hard to get into. They were just relatively expensive, and service mostly was bad. The thing is, there wasn't a lot of motivation for the restaurant to be better. Cooks and waiters would get their salaries anyway.

**Столовая** — I can't translate this, because I don't know any real analogue. But basically it is the place where all the food was prepared beforehand (in the morning), and you don't have any waiters. So you are taking an empty plate and you go to the service table where you could choose between several dishes and pay. The menu could be the same for years, but differed depending on the day of the week (or not). On Wednesdays or Thursdays you have a fish-centered menu (or not, but never on Mondays or Fridays, they are not Fish days, never). The quality of food is mostly bad, but even if it's not the food is extremely simple. Pasta, bortsch (or soup), potatoes, some meat (or fish). And juice, but usually it's not a real juice, and it's not fresh, it's *компот* (**compote**).

If you're okay with the simple food some of these places were quite good. And it was fast. And it was relatively cheap. In the city you could have a full meal (bortsch, potatoes, boulette and compote) for less than rouble. And don't worry about consuming too much meat, chances are your boulette contains a lot of bread with milk because it's cheaper than using real meat all the way. Anyway, some places were quite good in their own terms.

And some of them were really cheap because some **столовые** were sponsored by near-by factories so their workers could lunch there. There you could spend 0.30 roubles per person, and you didn't have to leave tips (but you have to get inside, and some of these factory diners were open only for their workers).

**Cafe** — something inbetween. Not as pricey as restaurant, not as simple as *столовая*. And relatively rare.

So, people mostly ate at **столовая** because it was fast, cheap and close to their work. If you have some family celebration you can go the restaurant (but chances are you are doing that less than 5-7 times per year, not more). Also there were **cafeterias** (self-serving, something extremely simple like sausages with bread or *пирожки* and coffee/tea) and **чебуречные**.

The last one is hard to describe. But if you are able to imagine a cheap-looking and even slightly dirty place that sells something very tasty and very-very-very bad for you, it'd be close. Chebureks are deep-friend turnovers with minced meat. (They are not really important in the big picture, I just wanted to mention them because I love them)

Regarding cuisine, I wouldn't say that there was *special* emphasis on Russian cuisine, but if you have only the simplest local ingredients around, and you don't have access to foreign cooking books, and you don't really care, it's hard to create something really foreign. Although Soviet cuisine have such recipes as French Meat (мясо по-французски) or Olivier Salad (салат Оливье), people from France would be very surprised if they had a chance to try it. Pizza was an extremely exotic option for the majority of Soviet people till 1986-1987 at least. No hamburgers. Nobody even knew what this is. (There is a beautiful anecdote about famous Russian translator who tried to translate some English or American book and didn't know what hamburger was. She only knew that protagonist held it in his hand. Her husband said that hamburger was probably just a funny name for umbrella. But several pages later the protagonist just ate this umbrella).

There were some Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijani restaurants. Also (to the less degree) some restaurants with Uzbek cuisine. No Italian restaurants, though.

Sorry for the long answer, but I hope you'd understand why the first McDonalds' restaurant in the USSR was such a big deal. It was fast, it was good, it was clean, and the quality of food was the same every day, and I'm sorry for saying that but it was a huge step forward for the Russian/Soviet restaurant culture.

State and the food culture is an extremely interesting question, but unfortunately I'm not qualified to answer that."

AskHistorians,Will historians thousands of years from now have a significantly harder time studying us because we no longer store any information on stone tablets? Like if the Sumerians stored the Epic of Gilgamesh on the latest SSD we would know a lot less.,"This is a complex question with a lot more facets than it initially appears. For starters, as another answer pointed out, you may be under the assumption that we have recovered a relatively comprehensive percentage of the data produced in antiquity. We most certainly have not. What we have, we have to a large degree by chance. As a simple example of this, the Rosetta Stone itself was used as building material in a medieval fortress, and was only rediscovered when some French soldiers happened to notice it had writing on one side. How many other such writings existed once but were lost or destroyed or recycled at some point in the last three thousand years? Countless others.

So by that relatively low standard of preservation, I’d say the modern era stands a fairly good chance of being observable by far future generations! There are certainly some important differences though. You noted the fact that modern data media are physically far less durable. This is very true! However, this is in a sense counter balanced by two important factors.

First, it is very easy to losslessly copy digital data from one storage medium to another. Because of this, we have an enormous number of copies of almost everything of significance. This harkens back to the countless scholars over the millennia who have devoted years of their lives to simply hand copying manuscripts onto fresh parchment. Their work is an important factor in much of the ancient knowledge we now possess, and that work in future generations will be as simple as copy/paste.

Second, the volume of data we are producing collectively is astronomically higher than at any prior point in human history. While this undoubtedly creates a lot more noise for future historians to sift through (I really hope they enjoy cat memes as much as we do), it also creates vastly more signal. As a simple way of thinking about this, if we lost 99% of all the data ever created by the ancient Sumerians, then what remains would likely be measured in megabytes at most. If we lost 99% of all data created just in the last decade of our society, what remains would still be tens of thousands of times more data than can fit on a personal computer.

Finally, a lot of people are thinking very seriously about this problem. There are whole companies, in fact, who specialize in this sort of thing (such as https://www.piql.com). Remember that most of our storage media are optimized for cost, density, and ease of modification. That doesn’t mean we *can’t* store things in a long-term stable format if we so choose, and in many cases, we have in fact chosen.

Almost all public code is on GitHub, for example, and almost all of that code (and critically, also its documentation) has been slurped up and reencoded visually (using QR codes), with those visual codings stamped onto stable film and stored in a mine in Svalbard. They also wrote a guide for understanding QR codes, just in case that knowledge is lost, as well as some other fundamental things like ASCII. This repository is uniquely critical since, if some future society really wants to understand all our cat gifs, they’ll need some way of translating the numbers which make up those gifs into a visual representation similar to what we see today on our screens, but somehow rendered onto their screens thousands of years from now. All of the logic that computers of today would need to decode a cat gif and turn it into a visual representation on a screen is contained within that archive. It wouldn’t be *easy* to understand that translation, divorced from contemporary computing contexts, but it would indeed be *possible*. This is our Rosetta Stone, in a sense.

So we’ve definitely put a lot of thought into preserving what is necessary to make that possible for the vast majority of society’s unencrypted data, and ensuring it is physically preserved for the kinds of timescales you’re talking about. Most of it will doubtless be lost, much as most of the Sumerian data has been lost, but the hope is that enough will survive (and enough context, like the gif translation, will survive with it) to give future historians a more comprehensive view of our present than we are able to get into our past."

In the morning Abraha prepared to enter the town and made his elephant ready for battle and drew up his troops. His intention was to destroy the temple and then return to the Yaman. When they made the elephant (its name was Mahmud) face Mecca, Nufayl b. Habbib came up to its flank and taking hold of its ear said: 'Kneel, Mahmud, or go straight back whence you came, for you are in God's holy land'. He let go of its ear and the elephant knelt, and Nufayl made off at top speed for the top of the mountain. The troops beat the elephant to make it get up but it would not; they beat its head with iron bars; they stuck hooks into its underbelly and scarified it; but it would not get up. Then they made it face the Yaman and immediately it got up and started off. When they set it towards the north and the east it did likewise, but as soon as they directed it towards Mecca it knelt down'.

&#x200B;

Now, let's pick this narrative apart.

**1.** **Abraha**

The Abraha referred to in the *sīra* was an Ethiopian ruler who took control over South Arabia sometime around 530 AD. In the preceding decades, South Arabia, then ruled by the Himyarites, had seen a struggle over political dominance between a pro-independence and a pro-Ethiopian faction. Although the sources are not entirely unambiguous, it seems that the pro-Ethiopian faction was able to install one of their own –   Maʿdīkarib Yaʿfur  – over the kingdom around 510 AD. His rule was ended by a pro-independence rebellion led by  Yūsuf ʾAsʿar Yaṯʿar, better known in the Islamic tradition as Yūsuf ḏū Nuwās, dated to between 522 and 524 AD.

Yūsuf's rebellion led to an Ethiopian military intervention, ending Himyarite rule and turning the region into a direct Ethiopian suzerain. The Ethiopians originally seemed to have placed a Christian ally of theirs on the Himyarite throne, but he was overthrown by the aforementioned Abraha. From what we know, Abraha attempted to establish himself as an independent ruler in South Arabia and adopted many of the stylings and political traditions established by the Himyarites in the centuries before. 

One of the traditions that Abraha adopted was the organization of regular raids into Central Arabia. After the Himyarites had established political dominance over South Arabia in the 4th century AD, they sought to expand their influence over the Central Arabian oasis towns. Abraha, probably seeking to establish himself as a legitimate Himyarite ruler, followed in their footsteps. In one of the last dated South Arabian inscriptions attested, around 552 AD, Abraha mentions his exploits (Murayghān 3, translation following [DASI](http://dasi.cnr.it/index.php?id=30&prjId=1&corId=0&colId=0&navId=126302817&recId=8670&mark=08670%2C001%2C002)):  

>1  The king ʾbrh Zybmn, king of Sabaʾ, ḏu-Raydān, Ḥaḍramawt, Ymnt,   
2  of their Arabs of Ṭwdm and Thmt, wrote this inscription when he came back from the country of Mʿdm,   
3  when he took possession of the Arabs of Mʿdm, from Mḏrn, he drove out ʿmrm, son of Mḏrn, and he   
4  took possession of all the Arabs of Mʿdm, Hgrm, Ḫṭ, Ṭym, Yṯrb and Gzm.  

Although the South Arabian script is unvocalized, we do recognize many of the place names mentioned here. Mʿdm most likely refers to the pre-Islamic tribal coalition of Maʿdd; Hgrm and Ḫṭ are two territories in East Arabia, whereas Gzm *probably* refers to the North Arabian tribe of Judhām. Most fascinatingly for us, however, is the mentioning of Yṯrb, which is certainly the pre-Islamic name of Medina, i.e., Yathrib. 

So the Islamic-period narrative likely reflects the historical retention of an Ethiopian ruler taking control over South Arabia and seeking to expand his influence through military aims over Central Arabia. There is even some rock art from South Arabia that seems to portray elephants, possibly made by someone who saw them in a military context. 

But that raises the question: where is Mecca in all of this? 

**2. Pre-Islamic Mecca as a holy site**

Although the existence of pre-Islamic Mecca is not really in doubt amongst most serious historians, it is rather annoying that there is no pre-Islamic documentary evidence referring to the city. A few years ago, Ian Morris wrote a [fantastic article](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiJ_aXB9MH9AhU7GFkFHYjDBrcQFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmedievalists.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2FUW-26-Morris.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2cveuiabqU6cvbl7gb_fVk) going through the traditional arguments in favor of identifying Claudius Ptolemy's Macoraba with Mecca and showed, I think convicingly, that they don't really hold water.

Now, while it is not impossible that Abraha attempted to and possibly even did conquer Mecca, the fact that it is apparently not mentioned in any of his inscriptions gives the impression that Mecca may simply not have been as important as later Islamic narratives make it out to be. It is likely that the narrative seen here probably sought to establish pre-Islamic Mecca as Arabia's holy site *per excellence* by combining a historical event with a Quranic narrative: 

Namely, the final part that I blatantly copied from Guillaume's translation is actually a Quranic *sūra*, appropriately titled *sūrah al-fīl*, 'the chapter of the Elephant'. The narrative also introduces Abdul Mutallib, better known as Muhammad's grandfather and describes him as Mecca's primary envoy to the Ethiopians, thus bestowing Muhammad's family with an additional honor. The fact that the elephant refuses to enter Mecca from any direction *further* solidifies pre-Islamic Mecca as Arabia's *holiest of holies.* And to top it off, in the same year that God saved Mecca from destruction, the Prophet was born. 

The fact that the Islamic tradition is not primarily concerned with providing an 'accurate' historical narrative is clear from several discrepancies. There is no evidence that Abraha died during one of the expeditions to Central Arabia, as the aforementioned inscription indicates. He may not even have participated in person. Taking the inscriptions and Ibn Ishaq's narrative at face value and trying to fit them together also pushes back Muhammad's birth by about twenty years. 

But in my opinion the more interesting thing is that early Muslim scholars actively adapted historical events and re-interpreted them to provide them with teleological and sacred meanings."

AskHistorians,"Why is the 'pizza delivery guy' such a classic part of American culture and not, for example, the 'McDonald's delivery guy'? How and why did delivery become such a ubiquitous part of how pizza restaurants work in a way that (at least until recently) it seemingly wasn't for any other kind of food?","Pizzas had three advantages for delivery over many other fast food offerings: high price, pizza boxes, and starting out oven-hot.

Food delivery isn't free - somebody has to pay for it, and that somebody is the customer. Even if the seller offers ""free delivery"", covering the cost of delivery means that the prices will be higher.

When pizza delivery was becoming widespread in the late 1940s and early 1950s, pizza was relatively expensive for fast food. For example, Casa D'Amore in Los Angeles began offering free delivery in 1952, for orders over $2.50. At the time, their combo medium pizza was $2.25. Why didn't McDonald's offer free delivery in 1952? At the time (well, [in 1953](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e5/4f/46/e54f46a886612f2d0b8dcab5a6a4dcab.jpg), but close enough), a cheeseburger, fries, and coke was only 39 cents. The average bill at McDonald's in San Bernardino was 69 cents. Assuming that McDonald's's margins were the same as Casa D'Amore's margins, McDonald's could have offered free delivery for orders 4 times the average size - that's a big order, and as a very above-average order, would be unusual. Of course, they could have slapped a delivery fee onto smaller orders, but then the cost of delivery will be very visible to the customer. The higher cost of pizza meant that delivery cost made less difference to the price, proportionally, and could even be made invisible to the customer by offering ""free"" delivery without making the pizza too expensive. (Casa D'Amore's pizzas weren't cheap pizzas, either. Pizza Hut large pizza cost only $1.50 in 1959. Covering the cost of ""free"" delivery would be at least part of the reason why their pizzas were more expensive than Pizza Hut's pizzas.)

Pizza delivery was aided by the pizza box - the pizza box protected the pizza, helped keep it warm, and also ventilated it enough so that it didn't become soggy. Pizzas also had the advantage of coming out of the pizza oven hot enough to burn the mouth of anybody foolish enough to try to eat it without letting it cool to a safe temperature. A higher initial temperature meant that it would be warmer on delivery than food items that started out cooler (all else being the same).

AskHistorians,Why does my (non-Jewish) mother use so many Yiddish words?,"This is a great and complex question! Your guess at Yiddish slang in pop culture is a solid one, but I think it's fair to say that Yiddish incorporation into popular culture developed *alongside* the social forces of assimilation and widening of the Jewish-American experience that pushed more Yiddish vernacular into English, rather than one directly causing the other. A lot of my sourcing for my answer comes from Sol Steinmetz's 1986 *Yiddish & English: The Story of Yiddish in America*, which charts this linguistic history.

The first avenue of Yiddish in America/American English comes in New York City in the late 19th and early 20th century. This is when massive waves of Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from central and eastern Europe came through Ellis Island and predominantly settled in New York, primarily in the tenements of the Lower East Side. (To learn more about this history today, the [Tenement Museum](https://www.tenement.org/) is a fantastic space of preservation, and its website has some digital exhibitions for those unable to make it to New York.) These immigrants were Yiddish speakers, and often exclusively Yiddish speakers; many hadn't received a formal or secular education back in their European Jewish communities back home. The first generation of migrants spoke Yiddish in the home, with many encouraging their children and grandchildren to receive a secular education, rely on English rather than Yiddish, and assimilate into American anglo society. Despite this assimilatory pressure, Yiddish was still a powerful part of American Jewish vernacular, and because of the tight knit communities in New York it became an element of gentile vernacular as well. Steinmetz quotes H.L. Mencken from 1936:

> In New York City the high density of Eastern Jews in the population has made almost every New Yorker familiar with a long list of Yiddish words, e.g. *kosher, shadchan, matzoth, mazuma, yom kippur, meshuggah, gefilte-fisch,* and many non-Jewish New Yorkers have added others that are not generally familiar, e.g. *schul, bar-mitzva, blintzes, kaddish, treyfa, dayyan, goy, dokus, shochet, schmus, shicker, schiksa, mohel, get, hesped, kishkes, kittl, meshummad,* and *pesach*. The Yiddish exclamation of *oi-yoi* is common New Yorkese, and Yiddish greetings, *mazzaltov* and *scholom aleichim,* are pretty well known and understood.

Of course, this was not restricted to New York. In 1920, Leah Rachel Yoffie charted the growth of Yiddish in St. Louis and how Yiddish proverbs were still retained by the non-Yiddish speaking children of Jewish immigrants. *Abie the Agent* was a comic strip from Jewish cartoonist Harry Hershfeld that featured a Jewish car salesman featuring ample Yiddishisms; it debuted at the New York Journal in 1914 and was eventually syndicated nationwide through a Hearst subsidiary. Singers like Sophie Tucker brought Yiddish influenced jazz entertainment nationwide and to non-Jewish audiences as well, with ""My Yiddishe Mama"" a bastion of the 1920s. The Andrews Sisters, a non-Jewish singing group, made a dent in 1937 with their recording of the reworked Yiddish song [""Bei Mir Bist Du Schön (Means That You're Grand).""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGveTSQbH30) Within the year TONS of artists put out recordings of the song, including luminaries such as Ella Fitzgerald.

That's not what Steinmetz situates as the thrust for Yiddish making it into non-Jewish milieus, though. While acknowledging that a full account of Yiddish incorporation into American English is ""rather poor,"" he notes that Yiddishisms had been seeping into English throughout the decades of the early twentieth century. The flashpoint for mass incorporation (and therefore, spreading to non-Jewish areas as per your question), in his view, is the Second World War, for two reasons: the influx of Yiddish-speaking Holocaust post-war, and the interaction between Jewish and non-Jewish soldiers in American military units bringing sectors of the country together for the first time. He writes:

> The oral use of these words was not recorded during the war, but it can be taken for granted that the earliest printed dates were preceded by at least several years of oral use among bilingual Jews of the second generation and their Gentile friends. The earliest recorded dates of the following common slang words illustrate the trend: nebbish [properly nebish] 'in- effectual or unfortunate person, sad sack' (1941, in Bud Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run?, also the short form neb ), shnoz 'nose' (1942, probably a blend of shnuk 'snout' and noz 'nose'), shmendrik 'insignificant person, nobody' (1944), chutzpah [properly khutspe] 'impertinence, gall' (1945), shmo 'simpleton, nitwit' (1947), shlemazl 'unlucky person' (1948), shnuk 'dope, fool' (1949), shlump 'sloppy person' (1952), mentsh 'decent person' (1953), megillah [preferably megile] 'long story' (1957), yente 'gossipy woman' (1957).

So a tl;dr answer: Jewish pop culture had been an increasingly large part of the canon throughout the early 20th century, and Yiddish vernacular survived the Americanization of Jewish first- and second-generation migrants, but the true moments of nationwide spreading came around the 30s and 40s...or right before your mother's birth. It's how the non-Jewish Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams could sing ""schlemiel, schlimazl, hassenpfeffer incorporated"" in the 1970s at the start of every *Laverne and Shirley* episode, have it set in not-all-that-Jewish Milwaukee, and not bat many eyes. The language diffusion had largely already taken place by then due to the gradual integration of Jewish individuals into broader secular American communities."
AskHistorians,Did 'The Simpsons' negatively affect the public's opinion of nuclear power?,"No, not generally.

While there are many episodes of _The Simpsons_ about nuclear power, the most significant for historical purposes is _Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish_, which aired November 1, 1990. It features the three-eyed fish Blinky, caught by Bart. The governor calls for an investigation of the plant, resulting in 342 violations, costing over $56 million dollars to fix. In response, Mr. Burns runs for governor (hoping to wave away the charges in the process); his campaign goes well until the climax when Burns comes over to the Simpsons on election night and [Marge serves Blinky for dinner](https://youtu.be/yFZ4zVn0NvM?t=108).

The uproar amongst the nuclear community (at this and prior nuclear depictions) was substantial. The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness [expressed they were ""horrified"" at nuclear workers being depicted as ""bungling idiots""](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1990/12/6/simpsons-spurs-ire-of-nuclear-industry/). The executive producer Sam Simon wrote a letter saying:

>I am sorry that the Simpsons has offended a lot of people in the energy industry. I agree with you that in real life, Homer Simpson would not be employed at a nuclear power plant.

Before that episode even aired, the producers and writers came for a tour of the San Onofre nuclear plant, where the spokesperson for the plant was adamant ""We don't have any Homers at our nuclear plant"".

Simon said that the tour ""changed a lot of peoples' minds ... No more three-eyed fish.""

It's unclear how sincere Simon was being with this re-assurance of the nuclear industry, considering the next season included _Homer Defined_ (October 17, 1991) where Homer saves the nuclear plant from melting down via a game of eeny, meeny, miny, mo.

At least in the minds of the nuclear industry they were sincerely worried:

>Images of nuclear power are not, of course, limited to individual words. One
respondent pointed out that the popular TV show ""The Simpsons"" has a strong anti-nuclear
message, and another respondent suggested that the shape of nuclear reactor facilities can
create unpleasant associations in people's minds. **Correctives to these problems were not
discussed.**

>-- Brien Benson, _Advanced Nuclear Reactor Public Opinion Project_, 1991

However, the claim is not backed up by data. If we're claiming an impact from the years of, say, 1990-1993: the existence of _The Simpsons_ made no dent in opinion polls. This is even true [if you look at polls run by the nuclear industry itself](https://www.ans.org/news/article-3114/support-for-nuclear-energy-grows-with-climate-change-concerns/), but [other sources with more pessimism about nuclear power](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2749543) echo roughly the same. There was a decline in the 70s _before_ Three Mile Island (generally traced to environmental activism); there was a significant drop of support after Three Mile Island; there was another blip after Chernobyl.

Even those two accidents didn't have as much influence as you might think. Three Mile Island happened in March 1979. Consider some NBC Polls on supporting constructing more nuclear power plants:

>Sep 1978: oppose 52%, favor 39%

>April 1979: oppose 65%, favor 29%

>October 1979: oppose 57%, favor 36%

In other words, it wasn't even until the end of the year when the opinions started to bounce back! Now, some of this is based on phrasing (some polls asked about ""the energy crisis"" as a starting line, and some polls were about building a nuclear plant ""within five miles of where you live"", which had correspondingly disparate data); in aggregate there was a 1.5-2 year downward bump due to both crises that eventually recovered. _The Simpsons_ shows no such bump.

Even if we try to look longer...

>Fast-forward several decades, and many children watch the Simpsons, a cartoon show that features three-eyed fish perhaps caused by the owner of the nuclear plant illegally disposing of nuclear waste. These media portrayals may make experts laugh, but they plant a bad seed with the public about the safety of nuclear waste management.

AskHistorians,Why did Mossad Nazi hunters bring some captured Nazis back for trial but assassinate others?,"Cukurs was fairly unique.

Was it the _only_ circumstance where a Nazi was killed by extra-legal means outside the war? Not exactly, no:
many (no clear estimates, but ""hundreds"") were killed by the Jewish underground in the immediate aftermath of WW2, and the 
Allies essentially looked the other way. There were two attempts on Alois Brunner (Eichmann's ""right hand man"")  who was in 
Syria (using mailbombs) but they were unsuccessful. He had already been tried and found guilty in absentia so it doesn't count as quite the same.

Cukurs, though, was intended as a political message.

...

May 8, 1965, exactly 20 years after VE Day, was a gigantic point of contention in Germany, and by extension, the rest of the world.

This is because the statute of limitations on murder was running out.

Specifically, current law put it at exactly that amount (20 years) but it meant that acts of the Nazis could theoretically not be prosecuted after this point. This was considered by default, essentially, a ""general amnesty"", and this had support in Germany, with a poll showing 57% for amnesty going ahead.

The Justice Minister (Bucher) put great emphasis on the number of Nazis already convicted, and that enough was essentially already done. The Central Office (which prosecuted war crimes) noted two to three hundred investigations that would need to be opened
immediately to even have a chance at prosecution, and how it would be essentially impossible to meet such a goal by the deadline. Bucher was adamant:

>We must be prepared, if necessary, to live with a few murderers.

The Israelis saw this coming, and the year prior (1964) the Prime Minister (Levi Eshkol) and Head of Mossad (Meir Amit) agreed
that they needed to take on a war criminal specifically to send a message to the German legislature. Essentially: if you
don't prosecute your criminals in a legal manner, they will be prosecuted in an extra-legal manner. Tuviah
Friedman (renowned Nazi hunter and director of the Institute for the Documentation of Nazi War Crimes) lobbied hard in
Germany itself, mentioning quite explicitly in one meeting the possibility of ex-Nazis being killed in the streets of Germany
itself. (It is highly unlikely that Friedman knew about the Cukurs plan, though -- he didn't have any connection with the Mossad.)

The Butcher of Riga, Cukurs, was a prominent target. His crimes were varied and infamous, including (in 1941) locking 
Jews in synagogues and then setting them on fire. (Some Jews tried to escape; Cukurs shot them personally with his revolver.)
But also: he was not, technically, in hiding. He fled to Brazil but under his real name, and even tried to befriend Jews
upon arriving (there not being any witnesses from Latvia upon his arrival able to identify him). By the 1960s he was
better known and under more pressure. The Soviet Union tried to extradite him (the
Brazilians refused and claimed he such a request could only come from the origin country of the crimes, which was of
course by then part of the Soviet Union).

So the plan was to get him into Uruguay, which had a potentially less violent response (and no death penalty); there
was also concern because any act in Brazil itself would
be more likely to put the Jewish community there in danger. Yaakov Meidad (who later wrote a memoir in Hebrew about
the events) posed as a businessman wanting to work with Cukurs and his successful aviation tourism business, and earned
his trust, even going shooting with him. Upon Cukurs's arrival on Uruguay at the safe house he was grabbed by agents
and intended to give a ""trial"", albeit an improvised one...

>We wanted him to know, that this entire long affair with Anton Kuen­zle and his ‘business associates’ who came to South America had been designed only to set the stage for the moment of revenge in the name of his innocent victims.

However, Cukurs fought hard enough -- biting off a finger -- that he was killed right there, with a hammer. His
body was instead left with testimony.

>Without screaming or weeping these people undressed, stood around in family groups, kissed each other, said farewells, and waited for a sign from another SS man, who stood near the pit, also with a whip in his hand. During the 15 minutes that I stood near I heard no complaint or plea for mercy. I watched a family of about 8 persons, a man and a woman, both about 50 with their children of about 1, 8 and 10, and 2 grown-up daughters of about 20–24. An old woman with snow-white hair was holding the 1-year-old child in her arms and singing to it and tickling it. The child was cooing with delight. The couple were looking on with tears in their eyes. The father was holding the hand of a boy about 10 years old and speaking to him softly; the boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed to the sky, stroked his head and seemed to explain something to him. At that moment the SS man at the pit shouted something to his comrade. The latter counted off about 20 persons and instructed them to go behind the earth mound. Among them was the family which I have mentioned. I well remember a girl, slim, and with black hair who, as she passed close to me, pointed to herself and said “23.” I walked around the mound and found myself confronted by a tremendous grave. People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that only their heads were visible. Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders from their heads. Some of the people shot were still moving. Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads to show that they were still alive. The pit was already two thirds full. I estimated that it already contained about 1000 people. I looked for the man who did the shooting. He was an SS man, who sat on the edge of the narrow end of the pit, his feet dangling into the pit. He had a tommy gun on his knees and was smoking a cigarette. The people, completely naked, went down some steps which were cut into the clay wall of the pit and clambered over the heads of the people lying there, to the place to which the SS man directed them. They lay down in front of the dead or injured people; some caressed those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice. Then I heard a series of shots. I looked into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching or the heads lying motionless on top of the bodies, which lay before them. Blood was running away from their necks.

Israel denied responsibility; there was initial confusion and even suspicion that perhaps Cukurs was murdered by Nazis fearful
he was going to name their location (people like Mengele being still at large).

However, the message did get through, and in March, when the legislative meeting in Germany happened about the issue, one member of the Social Democratic Party (Adolf Arndt) who was originally supportive of the amnesty, gave a speech in the opposite direction:

>A man who takes an infant by the feet in front of his mother and shatters his head on the nearest iron post, a man who has 20,000 or 30,000 people shot or killed, a man who trains his dog so that he tears apart a prisoner’s genitals before the prisoner is put to death in the most cruel way, a man who forces prisoners to kneel in the pit they have dug themselves, then gives them ‘the neck shot,’ and then the next victim comes in, so that for days a fountain of blood splashes out of this mass grave, one can not say of this man: Why is he still dealing with his act today?

Most of this is a description specifically of The Butcher of Riga. He also talks about ""sharing guilt"" that he didn't speak
when the Jews were taken away, and that ""We must not turn our back upon the mountain of guilt and sin which lies behind us.""

Two proposals at the debate were put forward to extend the statute of limitations. On March 27, votes went 361-94 for
extending the prosecution of Nazis.

In general, while the Mossad have done assassinations in numerous other cases, the preference for Nazis has 
been actual prosecution; unfortunately, the circumstances of the Cukurs case (and his
attempt to rehabilitate his image while alive) have led to a push amongst the hard-right to clear his name, something
that may not have happened had he faced real justice.

AskHistorians,Why was so much Christmas music created in the 1950s compared to other decades?,"The answers by [u/hillsonghoods](https://www.reddit.com/u/hillsonghoods/) and [u/phosphenes](https://www.reddit.com/u/phosphenes/) are excellent introductions to canon formation in general and musical canon formation in particular, but I would like to add a few more factors that I think are extremely pertinent for the particular formulation of the American Christmas music canon:

* The extreme, record-breaking success of Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" in 1942. It's hard to overstate how well this record did: It's not only, by far, the most successful song in the Great American Songbook, but the biggest-selling single of all time, clocking in at an astonishing 50 millions singles sold and never beaten despite the record industry still having some forty years of constant growth ahead of it. Sure, Tin Pan Alley did have a history of successful Christmas songs before ""White Christmas"", like 1937's ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"", but the absolute sales tsunami of Irving Berlin's song produced a host of copycats. Much of what we think of as the Christmas pop music canon was written in the subsequent decade, from ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" to ""Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer"". ""White Christmas"" was a touching point throughout. In his autobiography, Tin Pan Alley great Sammy Cahn memorably indicates the sheer reverence that the song was held in:

>One day during a very hot spell in Los Angeles the phone rang and it was Jule Styne to say, ""Frank wants a Christmas song."" Most Christmas songs, I should say, are written in the heat of June or at the latest July, in order to give the singer, publisher, the record company, the promotion people, and the weather a chance to get together. ""Jule, we're not going to write any Christmas song,"" I said. **""After Irving Berlin's 'White Christmas'? The idea's just ridiculous.""** Jule said: ""Frank *wants* a Christmas song.""

* The advance of recording technology and the hi-fi boom. High-fidelity recording, the kind we're used to today, didn't really reach its full height until the second half of the 1950s. This period also saw ""Hi-Fi"", high fidelity, become a significant marketing factor by record companies and record player manufacturers. The particular style we associate with Christmas songs of the era – soft crooner singing recorded by highly-sensitive microphones, full orchestras with large string sections, and so on – was simply not possible to achieve earlier, and earlier material suffers in comparison. As a result, much of what we think of as standard recordings of Christmas music is actually re-recordings made using this improved technology. Take ""The Christmas Song"" by Nat King Cole, [where the (second) 1946 recording was the first hit version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-RXKcc0sZs&ab_channel=The78Prof), but where [a 1961 re-recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKhRnZZ0cJI&ab_channel=NatKingColeVEVO) is almost universally the version ending up on compilations today.
* The rise of the 12-inch LP album as a significant commercial format in the first half of the 1950s. Albums didn't start outselling singles until a decade and a half later, but there was still a significant market for them, and Christmas *albums*, even more so than Christmas singles, were very successful in this period. (As a comparison, by 1960, three Christmas singles had reached #1 in the pop charts, besides ""White Christmas"" also Jimmy Boyd's ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" and ""The Chipmunk Song"". In the same period, six different Christmas albums had reached #1 in the album charts.) The rise of the Christmas album as a format is very important for canon formation! While many hit singles would receive a handful of recordings of the same material in subsequent years, it was only with the advent of the album that you really get an explosion of new versions of the same song.  The few years in the early 1950s helped cement what songs formed part of the Christmas music canon partially because this was when a lot of artists had to pick what to include on their Christmas albums from the previous decade of hits, and some songs became almost universal inclusions, while others remained in the dust. Your Frosty and your Rudolph got to stay onboard, while other somewhat successful novelty singles like ""Angie, The Christmas Angel"" or ""Suzy Snowflake"" got left out in the cold, and never really recovered.
* Finally, the stylistic changes of the 1950s are a significant factor in why Christmas music canon formation stopped in the late 50s. The market shifted away from traditional pop novelties to a large extent, and (at least for a while) from the major labels and their giant, orchestrated recordings to independent labels, younger musicians and smaller recording studios. (It is notable [as discussed in my previous answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z1j7p8/jingle_bell_rock_and_rockin_around_the_christmas/ixgh1fw/?context=3) that the enduring Christmas songs that supposedly are in this ""new style"" of youth music are still part of the Tin Pan Alley/major-label machine, and only had limited success on first release.) Tin Pan Alley retreated, and kept working on older styles instead. Many successful recordings of Christmas music would continue to be produced, not least albums, but most of them were now consciously targetting an older audience (enshrined as the *Easy Listening* Billboard chart in 1961) and evoking nostalgia of the ""White Christmas""-related pop of two decades earlier, or rerecording the same material, severed from contemporary youth rock. No wonder new songs were hardly added to the canon!

AskHistorians,What exactly was Alexander the great's end goal? World empire? Spreading Greek/Macedonian culture everywhere? Just personal glory?,"u/_tom_bishop_ has already laid out the decisive arguments among Alexander historians, but I would like to attempt another approach. Looking at the pragmatic and strategic considerations of Alexander's eastward expansion, I am mostly going to rely on Sabine Müller's 2019 work *Alexander der Große* as well as her earlier works on the history of the Argead house, as Macedonian history is also my personal field of study.

First of all we can't forget that Alexander's eastward conquests were not just his plans, but also those of his father, Philip II. At the time of Alexander's accession to kingship, there were already Macedonian vanguard armies in Asia minor. What Philip's goal regarding the expedition was is up for debate, but from a pragmatic standpoint, expanding eastward and extending the reach of Macedonia's influence over the Greeks beyond the Aegean was a logical next step; mainland Greece (except for the Spartans) was already under Philip's Corinthian League, so why not extend this reach further? A generation before Philip, Agesilaos II. of Sparta had already proven that raiding the Achaemenid Empire could be very profitable, and thus there was also precedent to be relied on when it came to planning an invasion of Persian territory. This was likely the original impetus behind the expedition, paired with panhellenic pretensions towards the Greeks to justify their participation in the project.

But to Alexander, this situation also opened up other opportunities, namely for the consolidation of his personal power. He had not been the only viable candidate for the throne at the time his father died, with other branches of the Argead house holding potential heirs whose legitimacy was no less thorough than that of Alexander (such as a nephew of Philip and son of a former king). Philip himself had only gained access to the throne by deposing the child king whose protector (epitropos) he had been chosen as, and as such, the succession of his line was far from predetermined. In the end, Alexander managed to take the throne through the support of the major noble factions of the Argead court, mainly those around the generals Antipatros and Parmenion.

This meant that Alexander was heavily dependent on the favor of these men, even moreso than the average Argead king would have been reliant on noble support. Parmenion in particular was vital for Alexander's military successes, but thus also held a huge amount of influence over the king and army. However, the accession to the Persian throne afforded Alexander with the opportunity to dispose of the meddlesome Parmenian faction, and to gain independence from the traditional Macedonian nobility. The role of Achaemenid king brought with itself its own support networks independent from the Macedonian motherland, while at the same time, a group of influential younger companions who didn't belong to Parmenion's inner circle began to take key positions in the army. We can see in the period around Alexander's taking of the Persian heartland a sudden and swift disposal of the ""old guard"" - Parmenion and his son Philotas were killed, as was Alexander the Lyncestian, the son-in-law of Antipatros (who was holding the homefront in Macedonia). Alexander could use the new power structures he had inserted himself into to rid himself of a burden that had troubled previous Macedonian kings, a powerful and demanding Macedonian nobility. His attempts at juggling and uniting his multiple royal functions after his taking the Persian throne can be seen as an attempt at retaining his previous powers while also solidifying himself in the new role that afforded him this freedom.

As for his further expeditions into India, it can't be forgotten that the Achaemenids had already had military and diplomatic contacts with the people of Northern India, and had already attempted conquest of part of the area. For Alexander, this was not a ""journey to the ends of the earth"", or an attempt at world conquest; he was simply picking up where the dynasty whose kingdom he had taken over had left off. Conquest of Persia could only be called complete if all the lands the Achaemenids had laid claim to could also be laid claim to by Alexander. Indian rulers had also provided Dareios III. with soldiers and war elephants at Gaugamela; this made them enemies of Alexander, and made their subjugation mandatory for his rule to be secure. This was not an overly ambitious stab at world conquest, but a newly crowned king establishing the pecking order with his more dangerous neighbors.

In conclusion, Alexander's world-changing conquest allows for the attribution of extremely tragic, hubristic motives to his attack on Persia, and these attributions have been conducted since Antiquity. Under that patina of Alexander romance, however, we find a Macedonian king who could rely on the extensive preparations of his father to finish the latter's last great project, an attack on Persia. This proved even more successful than expected, with Alexander taking over the Achaemenid throne. This newfound position of power, paired with a certain distance to the motherland, afforded the young king with the opportunity to dispose of his father's ""old guard"" and rule without interference from the people who had secured him the Macedonian throne. The rest of his campaigns were not conducted as a means of world conquest or universal despotism, but mostly to fulfill and maintain his new role as Persian king, paired with all the foreign policy obligations that role brought with itself."

AskHistorians,"When did humans begin escorting dogs on ""walks""? Did upper-class urbanized Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians have slaves walk their dogs? What about the Greeks and Romans?","When did humans begin escorting dogs on walks? We... don't know. The current thinking is that dog domestication predates agriculture, which means it predates sedentary society. The earliest domestic dogs were likely moving around with us when we were still primarily nomadic. In that sense, the answer is ""since the beginning of dogs"" but that's probably not what you're asking. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're asking about settled, sedentary societies where dogs are/were indoors with people and not getting enough exercise on the regular, thus requiring daily walks? Dog walking as a chore? 

We've always walked with dogs, but I think it only became a daily chore once we started spending most of our time indoors being physically inactive and brought dogs inside to be inactive with us. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when that happened, so maybe someone with more knowledge on work change like the Industrial Revolution can chime in. 

There have also been the cultural changes of ""let animals wander a bit"" versus ""keep your dog inside/in the yard and under control at all times"". Some of the former still exists as evidenced by that one neighbor with the yelling chihuahua that's always loose. 

The Ashkelon Dog Cemetery (in modern-day Israel; historically part of Egypt and other settlements) has some of our oldest dog walking depictions. Images of people walking dogs on leashes are carved on tombs here. I can't find any radiocarbon dates, but estimates vary from 2400 years ago to ""all three periods of ancient Egyptian history"". I'm sorry that's not more specific. We're also not sure on who is it that's walking the dogs. 

In modern-day Saudi Arabia there are two petroglyph sites, Shuwaymis and Jubbah, which we *think* date to around 8000 years ago. Among other things are depictions of a person hunting with dogs. Some of the dogs have a line drawn/carved leading from their neck to the person. That could make this the earliest indication of a collar and leash, but there's more work to be done on interpretation there. Even if it is a collar and leash, it's probably more for control and using the dogs as tools than keeping a dog close during a casual walk. Up to you if you want to count this. 

I've heard speculation that Sumerians invented dog collars, but I don't have any academic evidence to cite for that right now. I hope someone has some good Greek or Roman examples for you. 

An archaeology professor of mine quipped that no science is misinterpreted as often or as loudly as the health benefits of chocolate or the history of dogs. There is a ton of nice-looking  ""dog history"" out there, but I'm skeptical of those that aren't citing research or other reliable sources. Examples of good and questionable sources below.

AskHistorians,"In the game Civilization 6, universities get bonuses if they are adjacent to mountains. In my life, I've noticed that *many* colleges I've been to are all pretty often in the hills, a bit away from the nearby city/town/urban center. Is there a reason they're so often on hills?","I think you are under a false impression and suffering confirmation bias.

If we look at the earliest universities in Europe, a lot of them *are* along river lowlands within sight of mountains. But that's just because many of the earliest universities were in Italy, and mountains are everywhere in Italy, so University of Pisa or University of Bologna can't be too far from mountains.

On the other hand, other early European universities like Oxford, Cambridge, Paris are all on pretty flat plains.

Netherlands is a very low-lying and flat country with a huge number of universities. 

Some of the best universities in Germany are on flat land in Berlin, e.g. Humbolt university. On the other hand there are universities like Heidelberg and Freiburg which are within sight of ~~the Vosges~~ mountains.

Some of the oldest centers of learning in Islam are at Baghdad and Cairo, which are low lying river cities. In West Africa the Sankore madrasa at Timbuktu is along a low lying city along a river.

There are many universities in Kansas, Florida, South Carolina, etc. on flat plains.

I don't think universities are specifically chosen to be near hills or away from hills. Universities are just chosen where there is space, and frequently are placed in urban centers or centers of trade, or where there are wealthy and highly educated populations. Sometimes that's near mountains and sometimes that is not."
AskHistorians,Did Hippocrates describe ADHD?,"I think you may be right that it is [citogenesis](https://xkcd.com/978/). Looking through the literature that makes these kinds of claims, I can see [a 1999 paper by Anna Baumgaertel](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70167-X) which seems to be the earliest source of the claim I can easily find on Google scholar, at least.

The Baumgaertel paper begins: 

>	Approximately 2500 years ago, the great physician-scientist Hippocrates described a condition that is quite compatible with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He described the patient as having “quickened responses to sensory experience, but also less tenaciousness because the soul moves on quickly to the next impression,” and attributed these symptoms to an “overbalance of fire over water.” His treatment recommendation was “barley rather than wheat bread, fish rather than meat, watery drinks, and many natural and diverse physical activities.”

The Baumgaertel paper cites a collected edition of Hippocrates’ works translated into English: 

>	Hippocrates: Aphorisms. In The Genuine Works of Hippocrates. (Translated from the Greek, with a preliminary discourse and annotations, by Francis Adams.) Birmingham, Classics of Medicine Library, 1985

So what are we to make of this? Firstly, Baumgaertel is not a historian - she's an MD writing about ADHD treatments, who basically just started the paper with some nice historical colour. So, we might not expect the highest degree of historical rigour - interpreting primary sources can be a challenge, and she appears to have found this in a primary source (though, in classic citogenesis style, the actual source is probably elsewhere). But hey, there's a source, let's look at it.

Francis Adams did translate the works of Hippocrates, but died in 1861 - so that's an old translation, not from 1985. If I find the copy of *Aphorisms* at the Internet Classics Library translated by Adams, and search for some phrases from Baumgaertel's article, I find ...zilch. Nothing about ""barley"" or ""the next impression"" or ""sensory experience"".

The Perseus digital library at Tufts has quite the convenient search function. It also holds a version of the *Genuine Works Of Hippocrates* though it appears to mistakenly credit it to Charles Darwin Adams later in the 19th century rather than Francis Adams (or maybe it is a revised edition and CD Adams is related to F Adams or something - but no matter.) More importantly, I get no hits for any of the phrases from Baumgaertel's paper at Perseus. 

So it is very likely, unless I am missing something, that the source for Baumgaertel's quote is something other than Francis Adams' translation of the *Aphorisms* ascribed to Hippocrates.

**EDIT** - /u/skvabs has found the source, which appears to be the work *Regimen* which is part of the Hippocratic Corpus - this is included in the fourth volume of Hippocratic Corpus works in the Loeb Classical Library translated by W. H. S. Jones in 1931; Francis Adams appears not to have translated this manuscript, I suppose considering it not a genuine work of Hippocrates, and so I suppose that the W. H. S. Jones translation is still under copyright in the US until 2026, which may be why it does not appear on Perseus or the Internet Classics Library.

The quote as it appears in the WHS Jones translation is: 

> But if the power of the water be further mastered by the fire, the soul must be quicker, in proportion to its more rapid motion, and strike its sensations more rapidly, but be less constant than the souls discussed above, because it more rapidly passes judgment on the things presented to it, and on account of its speed rushes on to too many objects. Such a person is benefited by a regimen inclining more to water than the preceding ; he must eat barley bread rather than wheaten, and fish rather than meat ; his drink should be well diluted and his sexual intercourse less fre- quent ; exercises should be as far as possible natural and there should be plenty of them ; violent exercise should be sparingly used, and only when necessary ; vomiting should be employed after surfeits, in such a way as to empty the body with a minimum of heat. To reduce the flesh of such persons conduces to their intelligence ; for abundance of flesh cannot fail to result in inflammation of the blood, and when this happens to a soul of this sort it turns to madness, as the water has been mastered and the fire attracted.

The other thing to say about Hippocrates is that generally Hippocrates is seen as something of a cypher for what might be better called the 'Hippocratic Corpus' - there are a collection of works ascribed to Hippocrates, but which are better seen as being part of a tradition. These people who wrote that Hippocratic Corpus saw themselves as physicians, who aimed to treat physical illnesses. As such, for example, an interesting paper by Chiara Tumiger in 2015 in *Mnemosyne* that analyses views of mental illness in the Hippocratic Corpus largely uses as its interpretative strategy an analysis of the usage of words that the Hippocratic Corpus writers use in passing while talking about other topics. So the implication here is therefore that there is not a clear, concise description of mental illness in of itself within the Hippocratic Corpus. 

So on the off chance that there is some equivalent to the Baumgaertel quote somewhere in the Hippocratic corpus that has been mislabeled, or which is for some reason not showing up in the Perseus digital library **EDIT: that reason being copyright** , it is very likely that the quote will be out of context. Almost certainly if 'Hippocrates' described a person with the characteristics above - 'quickened responses to sensory experience', for example - it would have been in the context of a case study discussing some illness, where the descriptions of the patient are effectively being discussed as symptoms of something wider. 

This is usually the case where the ancient physicians talk about what we might now call mental illness; the likes of Galen do not think that the imbalance of the humours is specifically associated with mental illness (e.g., too much black bile resulting in melancholy, which is comparable to our modern idea of depression), but that mental illness is usually one symptom in a greater constellation of symptoms. So - if the quote is real, and my inability to find the thing is a me problem, not citogenesis - I think it is likely that the ADHD-like symptoms are taken out of context, and that they would be mentioned fairly briefly in passing. 

**EDIT**

So now that /u/skvabs helped us locate the passage, it is - as they also say in their post below - clear that the passage is not about ADHD, despite that I'm sure it's relatable to people with ADHD. 

'Hippocrates' goes on to say that: 

> But if in any case the water be yet more mastered by the fire, such a soul is too quick, and men of this type inevitably suffer from dreams. They are called ""half-mad""; their condition, in fact, is next door to madness, as even a slight untoward inflammation results in madness, whether arising from intoxication, or from over-abundance of flesh, or from eating too much meat.

Here, the discussion of 'the water' and 'the fire' comes from the theory of the humours of the Ancient Greek physical medicine tradition; it was believed that given there were four elements - earth, air, fire, water - that there were bodily fluids (the humours) that corresponded to each. The bodily fluid that corresponds to fire, accordingly, is yellow bile/'cole', and so the treatment regimens suggested by 'Hippocrates' for this condition are intended to reduce the level of cole. I think, in context, that it is likely that 'Hippocrates' in the quote used by Baumgaertel is intending to describe a condition that sounds more similar to what modern people would call bipolar disorder, rather than ADHD - the description of the 'half-mad' there is suggestive of people with a predisposition to manic episodes. 

So I would suggest that, in the passage quoted by Baumgaertel, that 'Hippocrates' is intending to discuss character traits that they feel are common in people who are predisposed to manic episodes, as part of a treatise on the relationship between the humours and a Greek concept that the translator compares to the English phrase 'being quick on the uptake' (not quite sensitivity, not quite intelligence - somewhere between). 'Hippocrates' suggests that people inclined to manic episodes are *too* quick on the uptake. In context, it appears to me to not be about an ADHD-like hyperfocus meaning you have a lack of concentration for other things you should be focusing on, but more the side-effects of a kind of overabundance of nervous energy."
AskHistorians,Why would my work issue me a warning for joining an Irish Céilí band in the 1940s?,"I've run into this anecdote a lot, and I think there's a bit more to it than meets the eye. The short answer is that it was likely a combination of public dances being seen as somewhat less-than-salubrious as well as the fact that traditional music was at a bit of a low point in overall popularity at the time. That would have meant that it might be ""unbecoming"" for someone of a supposedly respectable nature to be seen in that sort of activity. It's also worth noting, however, that Reid was also known to burn the candle at both ends, meaning that his extracurricular activities may also have affected his work in the usual ways. 

The reason I say there's more than meets the eye is because traditional Irish music or ""trad"" as it's often referred to has a tendency towards mythmaking. In that light, the popularity of this particular anecdote is telling. I'm not saying that it isn't *true;* I'm sure he did suffer a demotion and playing ceilis may have been a part of it. But the reason it's told in this way, that there's such an emphasis put on his attendance at a ceili being the cause of his demotion, is that it paints the music in a certain light. It's anti-authority, on the edge, out of the mainstream, looked down on by the more sophisticated and urbanized elite. 

First off, a bit of a definition of what we mean by ""trad."" Broadly speaking, what we're talking about is a form of dance music that coalesced in the middle of the 19th century, centred around instruments like the fiddle, uilleann pipes (more on that in a second), and flute. Later in the 19th century the concertina and accordion/melodeon became hugely popular and were incorporated into the music. In this context the music was inherently a social affair, with musicians often playing for formal and informal gatherings of people. It had particular popularity in rural areas, especially in the less-urbanized western parts of Ireland.

Interest in trad spiked around the turn of the century with the ""Gaelic Revival,"" a surge of nationalist fervor in Ireland that promoted all things ""Irish."" This was accompanied by a certain amount of mythmaking surrounding the music. Writers like Francis O'Neill and William Henry Grattan Flood wrote flowery, often less-than-historical tracts about the music detailing its ancientness, its Gaelic-ness, its singular genius, and its deep roots in the character of the Irish nation. For example, Flood is credited with re-naming the ""union pipes"" to the ""uilleann pipes,"" based on the Irish word for ""elbow"" (the elbow drives the bellows that fill the bag, so it makes at least some sense). He based it on some fairly dubious etymology/history, but the likely *real* reason is that the word ""union"" carried very uncomfortable associations for Irish nationalists. This kind of shaping of the narrative is key to understanding trad in its context.

Céilí dancing was another product of the Gaelic Revival, a codification of folk dancing that was seen as inherently, inextricably ""Irish."" Set dancing, another form of social dancing which took more obvious cues from continental and English country dancing, was actually in many ways much more popular in rural areas (and still is in some places). Céilí dancing was therefore positioned as an *alternative* to set dancing, one more closely aligned with the Gaelic Revival's key interests. It's worth noting that the revival was particularly popular among the middle and upper classes, and so while céilí dancing is a form of folk dancing, it's not one that carries with it the sort of stain of poverty, low class, etc. that many folk dances have.

No discussion of dancing music in Ireland during this time would be complete without mentioning the Public Dance Halls Act of 1935. This put a set of regulations and licensing in for dance halls in the country, curtailing the sorts of informal gatherings where trad would have thrived. It was the result of a moral panic that not only focused on the accusations of sexual immorality that dancing often gets, but also on the ""foreignness"" of the music being danced to. In this case, jazz was the main target, but set dancing was also in the crosshairs. The Act is usually seen as a turning point in trad, hastening a slide in popularity from the peak it enjoyed during the Gaelic Revival into a valley in the 1940s and early 50s (when another revival hit).

You could easily argue, though, that the Public Dance Hall Act was actually a *good* thing for céilí bands. The act funneled people into larger, more centralized, commercialized, formal (not in dress but in organization) dance halls. It was also largely the result of a moral panic involving not only the usual scare tactics about dancing and immoral behaviour, but also the undue influence of ""foreign"" music on the Irish public. So, when you want music to fill your dance hall, you were likely going to look for A) a big, well-rehearsed group that had the volume, stamina, and professionalism you needed and B) something very obviously Irish. It helped as well that céilí dancing was seen as much more modest/chaste than set dancing.

I therefore find it somewhat hard to believe that the sole reason for Reid's demotion was some kind of moral objection to his activities with the céilí band. Again, trad was certainly not as popular as it once had been, and it may well have been seen as the pursuit of an unsophisticated ""country bumpkin""-type rather than an educated man. But it wouldn't have been *objectionable* in the same way that playing jazz or even for sets would have been. Reid's reputation for absent-mindedness and possible over-stretching of his time/abilities would to my mind be an Occam's Razor answer as to why he suffered professionally. 

Instead, I think the anecdote is simply a good story, a tale of persecution, sacrifice, and ultimate triumph as the Tulla Céilí band rose to prominence. It's one of many you'll find in trad, which has never been able to pass up an opportunity to shroud itself in legend. I hope you're enjoying playing it so far, and maybe some day I'll see you at a session!"
AskHistorians,Soviet Excavations in the Arctic Circle: Why Can't I find the Lost City of Mangazeya on a Modern Map?,"A fascinating question! First: part of the problem is probably one of scale, the sorts of archaeological work performed, what was collected, and so on. I wouldn't anticipate this sort of archaeological research to leave enduring records at the scale of the Google imagery that I see. Your intuition about the river's impact also seems to have some truth, as by the 1960s up to a third of the settlement had been lost. But the city is still there, and it looks like additional archaeological research was undertaken recently. So while Mangazeya is an *abandoned* city, it is not a lost one.

Permafrost certainly inhibits what scale of excavations can occur (and what you would expect to find, at any rate; while permafrost would preserve items, it also limits how deeply they can be find), and while the city flourished in the 17th century due to gold, furs, and trade, it declined fairly quickly. Dozens of expeditionary settlements were founded in the 16th and 17th centuries in Siberia and quickly abandoned. Mangazeya is notable for its scale and permanence (rather than just existing as a trapping or minor trading outpost, it had a significant kremlin, supporting industries, and considerable foreign trade). [Here](https://imgur.com/WK1NDQY) are a few [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Z6In0BH) of the site: while it is a remarkable record of 17th century Siberian life, it does not occupy an enormous area or possess large, extant buildings. The Soviet archaeologists excavated fewer than four acres of the site, but collected thousands of cultural objects; [here](https://imgur.com/a/484SYaJ) is an example collection of artifacts. In addition to personal life with chess pieces, writing, and so on, the archaeologists also collected significant information on construction, shipbuilding, politics, and trade: in the pictures you can see the reuse of ships as constructions material, and a unique method of construction to deal with permafrost instability.

The Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic has an exhibit on Mangazeya, where objects from the Netherlands and the HRE were recovered (and, indeed, a map marking the city was produced in Amsterdam).

AskHistorians,Why is Kissinger considered a foreign policy genius?,"This is a really provocative and endlessly fascinating. Kissinger has been in a major figure in lots of my research, but I don't think I've ever come to grips with the 'real' HK. And being a controversial figure, there have been millions of words written about him, both critical and hagiographic. So, why is he hailed - in some quarters at least - as a 'foreign policy genius'?

Firstly - and crucially - we have to contend with Kissinger's own capacity for both publicity and mythmaking. There are few post-WW2 public, governmental figures - and I really mean this in global terms - who have been so invested in the creation and maintenance of their own myth. Many people believe Kissinger is a genius because Kissinger keeps telling them he's a genius. For example, his three volumes of extremely problematic (as sources of historical evidence) memoirs can be used as prima facie evidence in the mythmaking case. Of course, this is true for almost all memoirs, but Kissinger's desire to be seen as being at the centre of world affairs regardless of the role he was actually playing shine through in those volumes. Moreover, those memoirs are equally remarkable for the things that they don't pay attention to as they are for the things that they foreground (Nixon-Kissinger nuclear non-proliferation policy \[or the lack thereof\], for one). He was also an astute manipulator of public image, courting the media, having high-profile relationships with prominent actresses, and generally being something of an A-list celebrity.

Secondly - and very much related to the above - is (to use Mario Del Pero's words) ""Kissinger-as-symbol"". Aspirational presidents, foreign policy leaders, and others have all used Kissinger as the avatar of a particular kind of US foreign policy: decisive, muscular, and above all realist (in the international relations sense). See, for example, the 2008 presidential campaign debate between Barack Obama and John McCain, where both sought to position themselves as foreign policy realists and co-opt Kissinger-as-symbol. For McCain and Obama, Kissinger was used as a symbol of engaging with an enemy without preconditions, Iran being the subject of debate in 2008 and the reference point being the PRC in 1972. It's a sad fact that Kissinger is possibly the best known diplomat of the twentieth century, for good or ill. And it's probable that many Americans would give his name first if asked ""name a diplomat"".

And, to be fair, HK does have the sheen of diplomatic victories: the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, detente in general, the opening to China. But as the OP correctly points out, Kissinger's involvement in woefully misguided - frequently criminal - foreign policy - tarnishes whatever reputation he might have. And even prior to coming into the Nixon cabinet, he was a willing participant in the Nixon campaigns attempt **\[edit: I should have been much clearer here and talked about the Nixon campaign's** ***contribution*** **to - and hope for - the collapse of the talks. My existing wording implies sole responsibility for their collapse, which - as has been pointed out - both diminishes the agency of North and South Vietnamese participants and implies that the interference was a crucial factor. I am grateful to** /u/insaneHoshi **for their contributions in this regard in the thread below. And see also** /u/jbdyer'**s far more** [**comprehensive appreciation of this topic**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vw4nh6/comment/ifopi0y/)**\]** to sabotage the 1968 Vietnam peace talks in Paris, and thus being party to prolonging the conflict for another agonising six years and causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. Kissinger's rise also relied on non-traditional approaches. He did not come to power through electoral politics, traditional government service, or success in business. Kissinger relied on academic circles, think tanks, and the institutions that were created to fight World War Two and the Cold War. Related to mythmaking and publicity, this brought him a level of glamour and interest perhaps lacking in other figures of his ilk.

That's something of a brief, surface-level take on things, as I have to head off to a meeting! However, happy to be involved in any follow-up questions. And I am certain that many other contributors will have much more valuable and insightful points to make.

AskHistorians,"In clear violation of the Constitution, four men under 30 were elected to the U.S. Senate in the 1800s. How was this allowed to happen?","While more can always be said, I answered this in detail a couple weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10nkg0m/in_the_early_19th_century_four_senators_including/j6a6fhm/).

The simple answer to it is that no one in either the state legislatures electing them or the Senate checked, which is not as ridiculous as it sounds to someone in the modern era given that poor official birth records meant that many people honestly didn't know their exact age, politicians included.  For Clay in particular (who very likely did know he was underage) he appears to have taken note that there was no oath about it required and that age was not part of the package of credentials he presented to the President of the Senate, which was how he got away with it."
AskHistorians,How much of the Jews' work in concentration camps was useful to the war effort and how much was just forced to inflict suffering?,"To answer your question directly, for the most part, Jewish forced labor was oriented toward tasks that were useful for the economy or the war effort, and instances where prisoners were deliberately worked to death or tortured by excessive physical labor were less common. The use of Jewish forced labor in Germany and other countries was a constant balancing act between the economic needs of the state and the war economy and the goal of racial extermination of the Jews. These countries balanced these issues in different ways, and the relationship between forced labor and genocide evolved significantly over time. Back in the early days of Holocaust studies, Jewish forced labor was commonly discussed within the framework of ""extermination through labor"", but more recent work has revealed that this paradigm is overly simplistic and that there are a lot of nuances to the connection between forced labor and the Holocaust.

Forced labor for Jews and other concentration camp inmates in Germany obviously preceded the onset of the Holocaust by several years. Within weeks of coming to power, the Nazis began setting up the first concentration camps and other types of prisons and detention facilities. Prisoners in these camps (both Jews and non-Jews) were generally forced to work in some capacity, generally on projects of local economic interest, e.g. construction or cleaning the streets in urban areas or agriculture in more rural areas. It should be noted that this labor was separate from the Reich Labor Service (*Reichsarbeitsdienst*), which was a system of voluntary (later compulsory) labor service for non-Jewish Germans rather than a true forced labor system. The aforementioned balancing act was uncomplicated at this stage because there was no Final Solution to prepare for, so economic gain was really the only motivation.

After the war began, the character of forced labor in Germany changed as the country's economy shifted into its wartime mode. There were a variety of different situations where Jewish forced labor was used during the war. Prisoners who were in concentration camps continued to be used as labor within those camps and their subcamps, while purpose-built forced labor camps (*Zwangsarbeitslager*) were established across occupied Europe. In some cases, the forced labor camps were used to provide labor to a specific company or industry (such as Auschwitz III-Monowitz, whose prisoners worked for IG Farben), while others were simply ""hubs"" for forced laborers in a particular era. In cases where the labor was used by a particular company, the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-WVHA) would often charge the company a fee for the use of the laborers (e.g. the prisoners sent to IG Farben from Monowitz cost the company 3 RM per day). 

The types of labor that Jews performed in Germany and occupied Europe varied according to local needs; in more industrialized areas like western Germany and Silesia, prisoners were often used in factories, while in mountainous areas they were used for mining, and so forth. Prisoners in camps and ghettos closer to the front were often used on military construction projects, which was dangerous and difficult work. However, in all of these cases, the prisoners were doing work that was productive and useful to the war effort. 

It should be noted that there was internal debate within the Nazi leadership about the course of Jewish forced labor and its relation to the coming Final Solution. Himmler, Heydrich, and the SS argued that they should eschew the use of Jewish labor in order to speed up the extermination of the Jewish population, while Göring and others on the economic side of the Nazi leadership argued for the continued use of Jewish labor as a replacement for the manpower that had been lost due to the mobilization of millions of German men of working age. Göring's argument that the potential of Jewish labor was too valuable to simply throw away won out, in large part, and Jewish forced laborers (along with other forced laborers) remained an important part of the German war economy. In the end, those Jews who were able to continue working productively or possessed specialized professional or technical skills tended to survive much longer than those who were not of working age/fitness, since the skilled workers were either assigned to work outside of the concentration camps or were selected for work rather than gassing if they were deported to the extermination camps. In most cases, the practical, economic needs overrode racial ideology, which enabled some people to survive. 

This question also played out in other countries which were aligned with Nazi Germany. In Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, Jews were expelled from the military under antisemitic laws that were passed in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and their compulsory military service was replaced with mandatory labor service. In those countries, Jewish men were organized into labor battalions which operated either within their home cities (generally intended for older and younger men and men with children), performing relatively menial tasks like clearing snow from the streets, while others were deployed to more remote locations to perform construction work or other intensive physical labor (generally these were younger men without children). These labor battalions weren't intended to be part of the killing process, since none of those countries had concrete plans to kill Jews at that point. After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union began, the paths of forced labor in Hungary and Romania diverged sharply. The Hungarian government decided that it would attach its labor battalions to its armed forces and send them to the front. Jewish laborers were assigned some of the worst and most dangerous tasks, including laying and clearing minefields and clearing barbed wire. Many people were killed as a result of these dangerous jobs. After the Hungarian forces were completely routed by the Red Army in early 1943, many surviving Jewish laborers were either killed by the Soviets in battle or executed by the retreating Hungarian forces. In this sense, forced labor became part of the Final Solution in Hungary, and more than 30,000 Hungarian Jewish laborers died.

In Romania, by contrast, Jewish laborers were never sent to the front. The Romanian government began to develop its own plans to eliminate the Jews in Romania by deporting them ""to the East"", i.e. to Transnistria and eventually into Nazi-occupied Ukraine. They were also separately negotiating with the Germans for the deportation of Jews living within Romania proper to Belzec, which was slated to begin in the fall of 1942. During this time, the Romanian government saw forced labor as a ""temporary solution"" to the ""Jewish question"", an intermediate phase before the ""permanent solution"" could be achieved, rather than as a part of the extermination process. Ultimately, Romania chose not to go along with the Nazi deportation plans, meaning that the Jews living in Romania proper had been spared their lives, although forced labor and other antisemitic measures would continue on until the end of the war. In any case, the Romanians weren't trying to kill the forced laborers, just to extract economic utility from them until it came time to kill them.

Now obviously you can look at this, particularly with respect to Germany, and say that the conditions in the camps meant the deaths of the forced laborers were inevitable and that this demonstrates the intent for extermination through labor. However, the behind-the-scenes jockeying for position among the Nazi leaders demonstrates that there wasn't really a cohesive policy as such; the deaths were simply the result of prisoners being overworked while living in unsanitary conditions with inadequate food. Of course there were cases where concentration camp guards forced prisoners to do pointless labor or strenuous physical exercises simply as a means of torture, but the actual forced labor system was designed to be economically productive in the time until the Final Solution was completed rather than a method of extermination in and of itself.

It's worth noting that forced labor for Soviet prisoners of war followed a similar arc. The Germans actually weren't all that interested in using them as forced laborers (at least not within the Reich) until after the Battle of Moscow and the failure of Barbarossa to deliver the knockout blow to the Soviet Union. The Germans were more or less content to just let them die until the spring of 1942, when Hitler reversed course and declared that Soviet prisoners should be used for forced labor, perhaps realizing that Germany was facing the prospect of total war and that its reserves of manpower for labor were totally insufficient for such a war."
AskHistorians,"The opening scene of the HBO show ""The Last of Us"" has a scientist in 1968 talk about the possible warming of Earth. Was climate change known and wildly discussed back then? When did scientists and academics, followed by the wider public, start to notice and talk about climate change?",">**Was climate change known and wildly \[widely?\] discussed back then?**

Yes. In fact some of the earliest newspaper articles linking the burning of coal to potential climate change date to [as early as 1912](https://scontent.fmel10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/237034529_1888647227975685_9013243226654177293_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=kz37sPuR2OUAX8USnme&_nc_ht=scontent.fmel10-1.fna&oh=00_AfALou1IofO4KYn8l1atcEb2I1b37FFQo21iygvfgZTygA&oe=63CA65CF), though at this point it was a matter of only mild interest since it was assumed such changes would take centuries.

Much closer to 1968, in 1965 President Lyndon Johnson [gave a speech to Congress](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-conservation-and-restoration-natural-beauty) in which he made these statements.

* This generation has altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale through radioactive materials and a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.
* Within a few short centuries, we are returning to the air a significant part of the carbon that was extracted by plants and buried in the sediments during half a billion years.
* Through his worldwide industrial civilization, Man is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical experiment. Within a few generations he is burning the fossil fuels that slowly accumulated in the earth over the past 500 million years.

Johnson was influenced by a report he had been given by scientists warning of future climate change as a result of human CO2 emissions.

>**When did scientists and academics, followed by the wider public, start to notice and talk about climate change?**

Scientists were discussing it seriously as early as the late nineteenth century. However, at that point they thought it would take centuries. It wasn't until better measurements of human CO2 output were made, and scientists realised in the 1950s that the ocean's ability to act as a carbon sink could be overwhelmed, that a sense of urgency set in.

But even before the 1950s, the science was becoming increasingly well developed. See [Guy Callendar's 1938 article](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49706427503).

* By fuel combustion man has added about 150,000 million tons of carbon dioxide to the air during the past half century. The author estimates from the best available data that approximately three quarters of this has remained in the atmosphere.
* The radiation absorption coefficients of carbon dioxide and water vapour are used to show the effect of carbon dioxide on “sky radiation.” **From this the increase in mean temperature, due to the artificial production of carbon dioxide, is estimated to be at the rate of 0.003°C. per year at the present time**.
* The temperature observations at zoo meteorological stations are used to show that **world temperatures have actually increased at an average rate of 0.005°C. per year during the past half century**.

See also the [1957 paper by Roger Revelle and Hans E. Seuss](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1957.tb01849.x).

* From a comparison of C14/C12 and C13/C12 ratios in wood and in marine material and from a slight decrease of the C14 concentration in terrestrial plants over the past 50 years it can be concluded that the average lifetime of a CO2 molecule in the atmosphere before it is dissolved into the sea is of the order of 10 years.
* This means that most of the CO2 released by artificial fuel combustion since the beginning of the industrial revolution must have been absorbed by the oceans. **The increase of atmospheric CO2 from this cause is at present small but may become significant during future decades if industrial fuel combustion continues to rise exponentially**.
* Present data on the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, on the rates and mechanisms of exchange, and on possible fluctuations in terrestrial and marine organic carbon, are inadequate for accurate measurement of future changes in atmospheric CO2.

Note that by this point it's being proposed that significant climate change could take place in decades, rather than in centuries."

AskHistorians,Why are people in medieval art so nonchalant about being murdered?,"Great question! Many saints in medieval art are identified by their method of martyrdom. That’s how the public could easily identify them as people in medieval art were rarely rendered for their physical features (though they were occasionally - art is vast!). For example, St Barbara is often depicted against towers and with chains - she was tortured to death in a tower, which is also the site of the miracles she performed. Though not exclusively, she and most other saints are not depicted during their murder but as heavenly figures afterward - i.e., hanging out near the Virgin and baby Jesus. Therefore their gruesome deaths are not *currently* happening to them in the paintings - they are more or less identifiers and reminders of the pain and suffering they went through to ultimately become saints. 

Also, between 1545-1563 there is something called the Council of Trent. This is a Catholic emergency meeting (that lasts for twenty years) on what to do about the Protestant Reformation. One of the things that comes out of it is some ideas about how Catholic artists should render images from the Bible, and the takeaway is that the scenes should be BIG and EMOTIONAL and INTENSE. You get bodies writhing and serious drama out of this. This is in direct response to the iconoclastic nature of Protestantism and the more subdued tone their art takes. Catholics are saying, let’s go for the hearts and emotions of the people through these empathetic and majestic portrayals of Biblical scenes. 

This obviously happens in the early modern period however I mention it as it’s important to note that prior to this moment, the portrayal of realistic responses to violence was simply not a major priority or dictum of medieval artists. Medieval artists in general were not interested in pictorial realism not because they didn’t necessarily know *how* but because it just wasn’t a priority yet."
AskHistorians,could the American Revolution have been avoided if Britain had given the colonists representation in parliament?,"No, I don't think so.

In the 1770s, England had a population three or four times greater than the British North American colonies, but demographic trends made it clear that the Americans would one day outnumber the English. In a publication in 1755 (*Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind*), Benjamin Franklin had concluded that the population of the colonies was doubling every twenty-five years. If this was correct, as it proved to be, the population in America would exceed the population of England by the middle of the 1800s.

Given these demographics, what would representation look like in Parliament?

First, during the Revolutionary period, there were some 550 members in the House of Commons. Representation, even with England, was very uneven. Old towns that had declined long ago and had tiny populations might still have the right to send men to Parliament, while new and flourishing cities (like Manchester and Birmingham) sent nobody. And yet, the British still maintained that Parliament had authority over the whole -- the idea that ""people could be represented only by men chosen by them from their geographical area"" did not match how Parliament actually operated.

The Americans, however, were increasingly arguing that government **should** work that way. But even if the British had accepted that idea, how would it have worked? Would Parliament have been willing to assign one-fourth or more of their seats to the Americans? Would they have been willing to increase that number as the American population grew? No, the very idea of handing so much power to the colonists would have been unthinkable. Or, would the Americans have been content with 1 delegate, or perhaps 13? Not a chance. They would have recognized that such a token membership would give them no real power, while simultaneously undercutting their argument about ""no taxation without representation.""

The Americans and the British were increasingly making different arguments about what representation meant and who actually represented people living in the various parts of the Empire.

1. The British said that Parliament had legitimate authority over all the empire, whether people were living in England, or Scotland, or America, or India.
2. The Americans increasingly argued that Parliament could only represent the English. It could not represent the Americans, because Americans did not vote for members of Parliament. Who represented the Americans? Why, the elected members of their own colonial assemblies, of course!

This is two very different models of Empire. The British model suggested that King and Parliament (both located in England, of course) ruled a global empire. The American model proposed that all parts of the Empire shared a common loyalty to the king, but that each part of the empire had (or should have) its own representative legislature. No legislature could make laws for people in a different geographical area. So, Parliament truly represented the English and had authority over them. But it did not have authority over Virginians. Their own elected body (the House of Burgesses) had legitimate power there.

The English regarded this argument as ridiculous. The idea that a backwater government in Georgia or Rhode Island could claim to be equal in dignity to Parliament struck them as bizarre. The idea that the legislative body of Great Britain had no power in the British colonies was equally ridiculous. After all, hadn't the colonies developed under British authority? Didn't they benefit from British trade and British military protection? To put it in modern American terms: to British ears, this sounded as if a high school student council was claiming to be equal in dignity and authority to the U.S. Senate.

In 1766, Benjamin Franklin was questioned by the House of Commons about the Stamp Act. He said that that Americans did not see themselves as being represented in Parliament, and therefore would never pay the tax. He proposed a solution, however: rather than trying to tax the colonists directly, Parliament should instead simply **ask** the various colonial assemblies to tax their own citizens. He assured his listeners that the Americans would generously show their support, and the taxation problem would be solved. Parliament, of course, did not listen to this proposal.

If Parliament had listened, would it have worked? Would the American assemblies have taxed themselves as Franklin assured the House of Commons that they would? Could we have avoided the Revolution that way? Well, one can never be sure. Anything is possible. But realistically? No.

How do I know? Because when the Americans had the chance to put their own government together, under the Articles of Confederation, they worried a great deal about centralized power and the destructive power to tax. So they gave Congress no power to tax at all, and said that when Congress needed money, it could simply ask the states for help. To put it mildly, this did not work. It was one of the primary failings of the Articles that led many of the nation's leaders to believe that a stronger national government was necessary. As James Madison put it, while arguing that a stronger Constitution (granting Congress the power to tax) was needed:

>There is little reason to depend for necessary supplies on a body \[any of the states\] which is fully possessed of the power of withholding them. If a government depends on other governments for its revenues; if it must depend on the voluntary contributions of its members, its existence must be precarious. A government which relies on thirteen independent sovereignties, for the means of its existence, is a solecism in theory, and a mere nullity in practice.

Distance. The vast majority of flights for freedom were from the upper South, where the enslaved persons were imprisoned within a not unreasonable distance to the North. If you consider some of the most famous people who were born in bondage, they mostly originated there. Harriet Tubman was owned by a Maryland enslaver, as was Frederick Douglass. Slipping North was the only real viable option for them, while traversing the entire South would have been entirely out of the question except in the most exceptional circumstances, and speaks to the general plight of those persons enslaved in the Deep South who simply had no opportunity. The famed flight of Ellen and William Craft illustrates just how tough it could be, their successful escape from a Georgia plantation being possible only because Ellen, a light-skinned woman who would have been a ""quadroon"" in the racial parlance of the time, was able to successful pass as a white man and her husband as her slave for the train journey northward, essentially traveling in the open, the one way to beat the odds of traversing such a large swathe of country populated by a hostile population and slave patrols looking for any slave without a pass.

So in short, you have enslaved persons from the upper South with no logical alternative, and those in the Deep South often with little chance of escape no matter what - many who did, in fact, wouldn't head North OR to Mexico, but rather would settle-down in the large, nearly impenetrable swamps that characterized much of the region, carving out a free existence as a small enclave within the slave south. But for those in Texas? Well, it is the Upper South in reverse, Mexico of course was where they were headed. As you note, slavery was illegal there - the desire to ensure its security being a key reason Texas broke away - and this made it an obvious destination for any enslaved person attempting to find freedom. 

It was enough of a problem for the laws of Texas to reflect the threat posed by the border to the institution of slavery. Texas has several laws in place that dealt with the apprehension of those seeking their freedom, but included extra enticement for those close to attaining it, as an 1844 state law entitled anyone who caught an escaped slaves west of the San Antonio River to ""a fifty-dollar reward for each plus two dollars for every thirty miles traveled to return them to the rightful owner. This was bolstered in 1858 law, allowing the person who captured a slave escaping to Mexico to be paid 1/3 of their value by the Travis County Sheriff, who would in turn be repaid the amount by the owner, or by resale of the person. Although ""An Act to Encourage Reclamation of Slaves Escaping Beyond the Limits of the Slave Territories of the United States"" didn't *explicitly* do so as it couldn't openly challenge Mexican sovereignty, the law was well understood to be offering enough financial encouragement to potential slave-catchers that they would be willing to risk going south of the border for their quarry. 

The latter law especially was a clear reaction to the opinions of Texans as regarded their neighbors to the south, as the Mexican government of course did nothing to return escapees, and Texans felt that many Mexicans were sympathetic and assisted those who fled, which was bad enough, but for those who remained in Texas such things could stand to “stir up among our servants a spirit of insubordination."" The inducement of escape also was feared to be fuel to the ever present terror of servile insurrection. An 1856 series of newspaper articles claimed to have uncovered a plot in Colorado County by a group of slaves to murder most of the whites, and flee south to Mexico, dragging along the young white women as captives for obvious but only insinuated purposes. Although there likely was some group of slaves planning to flee their prison camp, claims were made of intricate organization that would make a Mason proud, and there is little evidence, beyond the writers' imaginations, that a mass group of slaves was:

>organized into companies of various sizes, had adopted secret signs and pass-words, sworn never to divulge the plot under the penalty of death, and had elected captains and subordinate officers to command the respective companies.

Of course, truth is beyond the point though, and what mattered was the impact on the white population. Conventions, such as that held in Gonzales County in 1854, were held to discuss the issue, the organizers there declaring:

>The escape of our slaves into Mexico by the help of Mexicans and otherwise has become a matter of magnitude, and of sufficient importance to demand some decided action on the part of the people of Western Texas.

In total, we can't put a precise number on how many chose the path of Freedom via Mexico, but certainly it numbered in the thousands. Even in Texas though, in the northern part of the state Mexico wasn't a guarantee, and some chose to make their bid by aiming for Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma) or further north to find sympathetic abolitionists in Kansas, but what records we do have would show them to be the minority. Mexico was the best option and the choice for most Texas escapees. But to tie back into your question, it was an option for few others. It was a tough enough journey through the Texas wilderness, such as for the group of 25 enslaved persons from Bastrop who requisitioned horses in 1845 and made their dash, but the odds of even reaching Texas, let alone Mexico, from Mississippi or Alabama, let alone the upper South, was far too slim, and whatever the appeal it might offer for freedom simply wouldn't outweigh the practical realities of affecting escape in the first place.

AskHistorians,North beats South?,"So, I hope this doesn't need pointing out, but the notion is transparent nonsense. Nothing could be easier than falsifying the claim that more northern regions always win wars against more southern regions, even ignoring the obvious northern hemisphere bias that is baked into it. The Romans defeated the Cisalpine Gauls in 225 BC. The English crushed the Jacobite rising in 1745. Done.

More interesting than the statement itself is the chain of assumption underlying it: that wars are won by superior technology, that this technology is generated by people's desire to live in greater comfort, and that the extent of this desire is determined by climate. All of these assumptions are as patently false and easily falsifiable as the general law of history they implicitly support. Both warfare and human innovation are flattened to simple mechanical principles here, and these principles collapse under the slightest scrutiny (How do we explain victory when two sides have the same weapons? How does military technology help people cope with the cold?). They are evidently worthless assumptions for historical analysis. But they reflect a very particular view of the way the world works. This is a powerful mix of geographical and technological determinism: the idea that it is not people, but their environment and their technology that shape history.

Where does this philosophy of history come from?

Geographical determinism - cold climates make more innovative people who make better warfighters - is very old. I've written about its early traces in [this older answer about a similarly silly modern attempt to formulate a law of history](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hd78tv/does_the_aphorism_hard_times_create_strong_men/). Since the 5th century BC, some Greeks believed that people who came from hard lands (by which they generally meant arid and infertile rather than cold) were naturally better fighters than those who lived in an abundance of natural wealth. Scarcity supposedly made them tougher and more willing to bear deprivation, while those from milder climates were used to luxury and unwilling to give it up. The supposed result was a cycle of history in which ""hard"" people conquered nearby ""soft"" people, but turned soft themselves by exposure to the luxuries they'd conquered, only to fall victim to the next hard people themselves.

You'll notice that this Greek notion isn't interested in cardinal directions. The most likely origin of the definition of geographical determinism along a north-south divide is Max Weber's concept of the so-called Protestant work ethic. Weber, writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tried to explain why the north of Europe was more industrialised and wealthier than the south (or other parts of the globe), to the point that the preponderance of worldwide economic and military power was concentrated in the UK and Germany. His theory was that it all boiled down to the difference in outlook between Protestants (who dominated these countries as well as Scandinavia, the more developed parts of the Netherlands, and much of the US) and Catholics (who dominated much of Southern Europe). The latter supposedly counted on their eventual salvation and eternal bliss, and therefore mostly enjoyed themselves in life; the former, on the other hand, believed they had to earn their ticket to heaven through a life of labour, austerity and piety. Weber used this stereotyped characterisation to argue that it was no coincidence modern notions of private property, capitalist endeavour, industrialisation, and bourgeois culture had developed in Northern Europe.

Undoubtedly, both these theories are inherently racist, in that they rely on the assumption that people born in particular places have certain innate traits that they generally cannot rise above. To many Europeans, the expansion of their colonial empires in the 19th century would have greatly reinforced the notion that there was something that set them above people from regions further south, since it was Europeans that got to rule empires and Africans, Indians, and indigenous peoples of America and Australia that formed their subjects. Stereotypes about the supposed lack of civilization, industriousness, technological innovation, and advanced political organisation among non-Europeans (all typically false, but pervasive) were easily connected to the old Greek idea of ""soft"" peoples doomed to be conquered by their ""hard"" betters. Weber's theory that it was all down to a religiously inspired ethical culture only reinforced an already prevalent sense that people from certain parts of Europe were superior beings - smarter, more determined, more pragmatic, and effectively born to rule. The rest of the world was destined to be their subjects.

I hope that all of this sounds both implausible and abhorrent to anyone reading this. The theories mentioned here are hard to discredit only insofar as they are deliberately vague, slippery, and unspecific. Weber always argued that he was merely constructing ""ideal types,"" models of interpretation against which to test historical cases, rather than actually writing the laws of history. But the power of these ideas lies in the fact that they instinctively *feel* true to a lot of people trying to make sense of the enormously complex canvas of human history. These are ideas that, especially in the age of European colonial empires, carried a great deal of truthiness - a truth that was sensed rather than reasoned through. For this reason it is important to stress that these theories - by shifting the agency of history from individual human beings to their geographical environment, culture, and technology - *serve as apologia for imperialism, colonialism and racism.* If Europeans conquered, oppressed and exploited much of the world, it is nobody's fault; it's just that they are born that way. Their domination is not a decision but an inevitability. Since Africa is warm and fertile, its people were always bound to be ""soft,"" and its societies bound to become prey to the ""hard,"" developed, expansionist peoples from the cold north.

Theories like these serve to erase the complexity of history and its grim reality, only to replace it with a simple scheme in which the only operative forces are beyond the influence of any individual. They are more natural than human laws. They are especially comforting to people living in northern countries that used to dominate peoples from further south, since they let these people tell themselves that it was simply the nature of things. All the better if there are a few well-known cases in which a northern political entity defeated a southern one without any additional ethnic dimensions, such as the American Civil War; they only add to the degree to which a notion like this can feel instinctively and comfortingly true."

AskHistorians,Did medieval Muslims have a catch-all name for all Europeans like Europeans had for them vice-versa (Moors)?,"As the many deleted answers would have us believe, the catch-all term was ""Franks"", and to some extent that is true, in some contexts.

The western European crusaders in the 11th and 12th centuries tended to call themselves ""Franks"" when introducing themselves to the eastern Christians they met along the way (Greeks, Armenians, Syrians), as well as the various kinds of Muslims they encountered. The crusaders didn't all come from France, but for the most part they came from the lands that were part of Charlemagne's old Frankish Empire several hundred years earlier - France, Germany, and Italy - and many of the most prominent crusaders were descended from Charlemagne or other members of the royal Carolingian dynasty. Not all of them were literally Franks - there were lots of Normans (ultimately descended from Vikings), English, Bretons, etc. But as a group, they typically called themselves ""Franks.""

This name, in Arabic ""Farang"" or ""Faranj"" (and in the plural usually ""Ifrang""/""Ifranj"") would actually have been known to educated Muslims, if they had studied earlier Arab geographers like al-Mas'udi. Al-Mas'udi was writing in the 10th century, a hundred years before the crusade, but he was familiar with the far-off Franks who lived in the inhospitable northern zone:

>""The warm humour is lacking among them; their bodies are large, their natures gross, their manners harsh, their understanding dull, and their tongues heavy. Their color is so  excessively white that it passes from white to blue; their skin is thin and their flesh thick. Their eyes are also blue, matching the character of their coloring; their hair is lank and reddish because of the  prevalence of damp mists. Their religious beliefs lack solidity, and  this is because of the nature of cold and the lack of warmth."" (translated in Hillenbrand, pg. 270)

These blue-skinned ice giants were skilled in warfare and hunting, but the cold made them savage, and ""they were also filthy and treacherous."" So when the crusaders introduced themselves to the Muslim world as ""Franks"", at least some Muslims would have already had this stereotype in mind.

Unfortunately we don't really have many sources from the Muslim perspective during the First Crusade, and the first Muslims that the crusaders encountered were the Seljuk Turks, who were not really educated scholars. They were still semi-nomadic and had only been Islamized a few decades earlier, but a Seljuk sultan governed Baghdad on behalf of the Abbasid caliph, and there were other Seljuk sultanates and emirates all over Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and Syria. Their chief adversary was, as far as they were concerned, ""Rum"" or Rome - i.e. what we usually call the Byzantine Empire. The Empire was simply the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which had always existed on the borders of the Islamic world, and was always rightly called Rome. An army coming from the west, from the direction of the Roman/Byzantine Empire, must obviously be an army of ""Rumi"", Romans:

>“The Islamic world had long been used to Byzantium as its neighbour, and parts of northern Syria in particular had been ruled intermittently from Constantinople in the period immediately preceding the Crusade…It is understandable, therefore, that initially there might have been confusion as to the identity of the Christian invaders who took  Jerusalem. Al-Abiwardi, for example, in his lament on the fall of  Jerusalem, calls the invaders al-Rum, the usual term for the Byzantines, and Ibn Shaddad also confuses Byzantines and Franks in his geography of northern Syria.” (Hillenbrand, pg. 71-72)

But most of the the earliest Muslim sources for the crusade come from the years and decades afterwards, when the Franks were already established in Syria. One of the sources I commonly use for answers here, just because he's so much fun to read, is Usama ibn Munqidh, who was a poet and diplomat from Shaizar in northern Syria. He often represented Damascus and Cairo on diplomatic missions to Frankish Jerusalem so he was quite familiar with the Franks. He even managed to distinguish between Franks who had grown up in Jerusalem and those who had just arrived from Europe:

>""Among the Franks there are some who have become acclimatized and frequent the company of Muslims. They are much better than those recently arrived from their lands, but they are the exception and should not be considered representative."" (*Book of Contemplation*, pg. 153)

But at this point in the 12th century, there was still no desire to understand anything further about the countries the Franks came from back in Europe. They were all just Franks and that was good enough.

After Saladin reconquered Jerusalem in 1187, Muslims authors sometimes understood a bit better that the Franks came from different countries - or at least that there were kings from different countries. During the Third Crusade, they understood that Richard the Lionheart was the ""king of England"", Philip II was the ""king of France"", and that there were also German crusaders. This was one way to distinguish between the newly-arrived crusaders, and the remnants of the kingdom of Jerusalem who were already there, who were ""Franks"". Altogether though, as a group they were all still ""Franks.""

It's interesting that we can also tell what language the Muslims got these terms from - most likely French. The Germans are called ""Almani"", and the English are ""Injlizi"", likely from the French word rather than English. In the 13th century, Louis IX of France is usually called ""Raydafrans"" - the ""roi de France"" - as if that was his actual name, instead of Louis. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who recovered Jerusalem for ten years starting in 1229 through a treaty with the sultan of Egypt, was also called the king of ""Almaniya"".

So individual kings and crusaders might be known by their actual country of origin, but Europeans in general were still typically Franks. In the 14th century, after the Frankish crusaders had finally been expelled from the mainland of Syria, Ibn Khaldun wrote in his Muqaddimah that the Franks in Europe were become more educated and were now learning about science and philosophy - perhaps due to contact with better-educated Muslims.

In a religious sense, medieval Muslims also rarely, if ever, distinguished between different kinds of Christians. Christians themselves certainly distinguished between each other - in the Muslim world there were Greeks, Armenians, Copts, Syrians, and Latins, among others, and the Greeks and the Latins in particular were often enemies of each other just as much as they were enemies of the Muslims. Latin crusaders conquered the Greek Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade in 1204. But the Muslims didn't seem to care about that at all. All Christians were the same to them! They were all ""unbelievers"" at best, and at worst they were perhaps ""polytheists"", worshipping three gods (the Trinity). When Saladin conquered Jerusalem from the crusaders in 1187 he was celebrated for defeating the polytheists.

The opposite of course was also true for Europeans, who rarely distinguished between different kinds of Muslims. ""Moors"" was actually not the usual term for Muslims in general, just the ones in Spain and North Africa. In the eastern Mediterranean, the usual terms were ""Saracens"" (probably from and Arabic word) and ""Turks"" (from the Seljuk Turks and later the Ottoman Turks). ""Turks"" survived even into the 20th century and was often used to describe all Muslims whether they were actually Turks, Arabs, or something else. But European terms for Muslims could take up an entirely separate answer...

So the very short answer is: Europeans were possibly Rumi, most commonly Ifranj, and occasionally they were recognized as English, French, German, or wherever else they might be from.

AskHistorians,"In Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor praises people who are not superstitious. What did he consider as superstitious and would his view be shared by the average roman of his time?","To (over)simplify it, it plays into a wider Roman notion of *religio* and *superstitio*, which can be very roughly read as ""proper"" and ""improper"" practice, and in turn it plays into the notion of the *pax deorum*, which was the notion that the gods must be venerated properly with piety and the correct rites (religio) in order to preserve peace, stability, and prosperity. Superstitio can be seen as a corruption or sidestep of these prayers, rituals, and rites.

Now, this would vary from time period to time period and from region to region, so making a list of what *concretely* is in either category would be futile (which also answers part of the question, in that not everyone would necessarily agree with the Emperor). But let's look at ""magic,"" as that would usually be described as an act of superstitio. To begin with, let's look at a case from before Aurelius' time, which I think is a good case to examplify aspects of this: the Apologia of Apuleius, who had been charged with, among other, things the use of ""black magic"". Below, I quote section 2, parts 26 and 27

>Do you hear, you who so rashly accuse the art of magic? It is an art acceptable to the immortal gods, full of all knowledge of worship and of prayer, full of piety and wisdom in things divine, full of honour and glory since the day when Zoroaster and Oromazes established it, high-priestess of the powers of heaven. Nay, it is one of the first elements of princely instruction, nor do they lightly admit any chance person to be a magician, any more than they would admit him to be a king. Plato -- if I may quote him again -- in another passage dealing with a certain Zalmoxis, a Thracian and also a master of this art has written that magical charms are merely beautiful words. If that is so, why should I be forbidden to learn the fair words of Zalmoxis or the priestly lore. of Zoroaster? But if these accusers of mine, after the fashion of the common herd, define a magician as one who by communion of speech with the immortal gods has power to do all the marvels that he will, through a strange power of incantation, I really wonder that they are not afraid to attack one whom they acknowledge to be so powerful. \[…\] But it is a common and general error of the uninitiated to bring the following accusations against philosophers. Some of them think that those who explore the origins and elements of material things are irreligious, and assert that they deny the existence of the gods. Take, for instance, the cases of Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus, and other natural philosophers. Others call those magicians who bestow unusual care on the investigation of the workings of providence and unusual devotion on their worship of the gods, as though, forsooth, they knew how to perform everything that they know actually to be performed. So Epimenides, Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Ostanes were regarded as magicians, while a similar suspicion attached to the 'purifications' of Empedocles, the \[‘spirit’\] of Socrates and the ‘good’ of Plato. \[...\]. I fear, however, Maximus, that you may regard the empty, ridiculous and childish fictions which my opponents have advanced in support of their case as serious charges merely because they have been put forward. ‘Why,’ says my accuser, ‘have you sought out particular kinds of fish?’ Why should not a philosopher be permitted to do for the satisfaction of his desire for knowledge what the gourmand is permitted to do for the satisfaction of his gluttony? ‘What,’ he asks, ‘induced a free woman to marry you after thirteen years of widowhood?’ As if it were not more remarkable that she should have remained a widow so long. ‘Why, before she married you, did she express certain opinions in a letter?’ As if anyone should give the reasons for another person's private opinions. ‘But,’ he goes on, ‘although she was your senior in years, she did not despise your youth.’ Surely this simply serves to show that there was no need of magic to induce a woman to marry a man, or a widow to wed a bachelor some years her junior. There are more charges equally frivolous. ‘Apuleius,’ he persists, ‘keeps a mysterious object in his house which he worships with veneration.’ As if it were not a worse offence to have nothing to worship at all. ‘A boy fell to the ground in Apuleius’ presence.’ What if a young man or even an old man had fallen in my presence through a sudden stroke of disease or merely owing to the slipperiness of the ground? Do you really think to prove your charge of magic by such arguments as these: the fall of a wretched boy, my marriage to my wife, my purchases of fish?

Notice the references to how the accusation suggests the practices to be dangerous and deviant, while the defense refers to it being a higher piety and understanding of the divine. But things are not always clear-cut.

>Therefore, if you desire to become in very truth immortal, act as I advise; and, furthermore, do you not only yourself worship the divine Power everywhere and in every way in accordance with the traditions of our fathers, but compel all others to honour it. Those who attempt to distort our religion with strange rites you should abhor and punish, not merely for the sake of the gods (since if a man despises these he will not pay honour to any other being), but because such men, by bringing in new divinities in place of the old, persuade many to adopt foreign practices, from which spring up conspiracies, factions, and cabals, which are far from profitable to a monarchy. Do not, therefore, permit anybody to be an atheist or a sorcerer. Soothsaying, to be sure, is a necessary art, and you should by all means appoint some men to be diviners and augurs, to whom those will resort who wish to consult them on any matter; that there ought to be no workers in magic at all. For such men, by speaking the truth sometimes, but generally falsehood, often encourage a great many to attempt revolutions (Cassius Dio, Roman History 52.36.1-3)

Here we see distinctions made between divination as an accepted practice and magic. On the other hand, Pliny the Elder (Natural History 30.1-2, 12-15) speaks of how acts of medicine and divination may hide or conceal superstitio

>In the previous pages of this work we have frequently refuted the pretensions of magic, whenever the subject and the place demanded; we shall continue to unmask them here. Magic, however, is one of the rare subjects on which there is more to be said, if only because as the most fraudulent of arts it has had the greatest influence in the whole world for many centuries. No one should be surprised at the immense authority it has had since it alone integrated and incorporated the three other arts that had the greatest sway over the human mind. Noone will doubt that it first arose from medicine and under the guise of promoting health it stealthily inserted itself as a superior and holier form; so, to its most tempting and welcome promises, it added the powers of religio, on which the human race remains even today completely blind; then to add extra force, it blended in astrology, everybody being keen to know their future and believing that it may be known most accurately from the heavens

To hammer home the aspect of deviation or perversion of proper ritual, see also Cicero's speech against Vatinius 14

>And since the beginnings of all great things are derived from the gods, I wish you to answer me,—you, who are accustomed to call yourself a Pythagorean, and to put forth the name of a most learned man as a screen to bide your own savage and barbarian habits,—what depravity of intellect possessed you, what excessive frenzy seized on you, and made you, when you had begun your unheard-of and impious sacrifices, accustomed as you are to seek to evoke the spirits of the shades below, and to appease the Dî Manes with the entrails of murdered boys, despise the auspices under which this city was founded, by which the whole of this republic and empire is kept together

So, as you can see just with ""magic"" there is a lot to uncover.

TL;DR

We can't so readily define and describe what superstitio was, but a key part is that it was a corruption of the correct way of worship (religio). How to understand, define, and draw lines on when something is proper worship varies in time and region. Not everyone would necessarilly agree with one another, and there can be a lot of semantics involved in debating these lines. Aurelius' praise was rooted in the lack of superstitio was a sign of a pious person who did his religious duty and preserved tradition (\*Mos Maiorum\*), another big concept in Roman culture

AskHistorians,Why is Han Chinese considered a single ethnic group despite having multiple languages and customs across its population?,"There's any number of angles that may be taken here, and with the field of what we might term 'critical Han studies' being a relatively diverse one in terms of perspective, do please bear in mind that the one which I offer here is not the only one that exists. What I posit is that the expansiveness of Han identity is due to the following combination of factors:

1. Han as an identity has historically been a political construct as well as a cultural one.
2. Han identity has not been constructed purely on the basis of recognised in-group similarities, but also by way of contrast against an equally constructed Other.
3. Han identity in its current form is a relatively recent construction emerging out of specific conditions that *made* it expansive, and thus relatively tolerant of internal variation.

As a primer, /u/Drdickles and I both discussed a similar question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/es9kd4/how_did_the_modern_chinese_concept_of_nationhood/), and /u/hellcatfighter covers a similar topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/b72sez/why_was_the_qing_dynasty_so_expansionist/f17ft9j/?context=999) and in a linked answer. But there is some scope for going more in-depth on your specific framing of the question, and we can go in the order of the points above.

Firstly, there has always fundamentally been a political dimension to how Han identity has been constructed, especially if we take a relatively state-driven, top-down approach. For instance, during the 11th century, when China was mostly ruled by the Song Empire apart from a small portion of the north ruled by the Khitan Liao, Han-ness was often defined as deriving from a relationship with the Song state. The Liao came to use the phrases *Han'er* and *Hanren* exclusively for former Song subjects who had been captured by or defected to the Liao, and while the Song did use *Han'er* and *Hanren* in formal communications with the Liao to describe what we might term 'ethnic Chinese' under Liao rule, internal writing generally lumped Liao-ruled Chinese under the labels of *Fan* ('barbarian') or *Beiren* ('northerners'), set apart from the main body of Han Chinese. And yet a state-imposed category of Han could be expansive as well as restrictive: the Mongol Yuan used the term *Hanren* to encompass all of the subjects of the conquered Jin Empire, which included 'ethnic Chinese' but also Jurchens, Khitans, and Koreanic peoples like the Balhae and Goguryeo, while at the same time reserving *Nanren* for former Song subjects. We will return to this later, but bear in mind that 'Han' has a long history of fungibility and reconstruction.

But we can make a similar argument from a more bottom-up standpoint. Inclusion within and exclusion from the 'Han' label could be deeply tied in with political and social interests. For example, the Tanka people of southern China (or Danjia in Mandarin) were not, by the Ming period, meaningfully linguistically or ethnically distinct from their neighbours in Guangdong or Fujian, but while not excluded from the Han label outright, they were nevertheless classified as distinct from the label of *min*, a somewhat ambiguous term best translated as a 'person of full competence'. The reason for this was that the Tanka failed to satisfy certain criteria: they did not own property ashore, and in particular did not maintain graveyards. With the veneration of one's ancestors being so deeply embedded in Han cultural norms, the lack of recognisable burial practices was a particular point of difference to grab onto. But identity as Tanka could be shed – albeit over the course of a couple of generations – by managing to purchase land and adopt a sedentary lifestyle, giving an opportunity for the better-off – particularly those who were able to accrue wealth through coastal trading – to secure a position within the locally-dominant ethnic group. This is not the only case of this kind of fluidity in identity at the fringes of the Han group, but it's perhaps the most salient example.

Secondly, Han identity was often defined in opposition to a construed external Other rather than purely on its own merits. We see this for instance in the case of the Ming, whose categorisation of the Han was simultaneously both expansive and restrictive: expansive in the sense that it sought to encompass both halves of the 'ethnic Chinese' supergroup that had been bifurcated by the Jin and latterly the Yuan, but restrictive in that in so doing, it excluded the various Inner Asian peoples that had formed part of the social and cultural fabric of northern China for centuries. The realignment of 'Han' with what might be termed an 'ethnic' in-group was in many ways a Ming construction, and it was one that emerged out of a deliberate move towards what some have termed a 'de-Mongolification' of Chinese institutions and society towards an invented autochthonous ideal. The Han were Han not just because they shared a common written language, certain basic cultural practices like ancestor worship, and a broadly similar socioeconomic base in the form of sedentary agrarianism, but also because these things they shared were things *not* shared by people who were construed as non-Han. Exclusion also characterised late Qing discourses of ethnicity as Han nationalism emerged as a force to challenge the Manchu-led pluralism of the Qing state: ethnocentric writers like Zhang Binglin and Liang Qichao seized on various forms of racial invective – the former more than the latter, to be sure – and emphasised Han distinctness from their Manchu overlords. The period leading up to the 1911 Revolution would be characterised in large part by specifically acts emphasising Han nativism, with the most visible being defiance of the Qing's court edicts mandating that Han men adopt Manchu hairstyles.

Finally, as the answers linked earlier go into in more detail, Han identity as a modern construction is an intentionally somewhat expansive one. Just as the Yuan took over Jin and Song definitions of ethnic categorisation, the Qing largely took over what had been an already somewhat reified conception of Han identity from the Ming. The 18th century saw the Qing court, particularly under the Qianlong Emperor, emphasise a stronger reification of the boundaries between Han and other groups, such as through the large-scale (though incomplete) dissolution of the Han Banners, who existed ambiguously between Han and Manchu. Anti-Qing movements of the 19th century tended to find themselves quickly adopting a relatively broad-tent approach despite often being led by members of marginalised Han subgroups. The Taiping leadership was dominated by Hakkas, but took a broadly pan-Han stance very early on, specifically championing Han self-rule and the end of Manchu domination. Sun Yat-Sen, who similarly called for Han majority rule, was a Hakka. Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei, the constitutionalist leaders who tried to dismantle the Manchu state from within in 1898, were Cantonese. These people saw no contradiction between holding an overarching Han identity and a sub-identity within that, but more importantly their political goals were suited by having as many people as possible included while still rejecting the Manchus. This in turn explains the later rhetorical shift that Liang and Sun underwent, as they moved towards the notion of a multiethnic nation that was nevertheless Han-dominated: the ideal was to be as inclusive as possible while still retaining some kind of conceptual boundary that made holding these individual identities relevant, and while also continuing to vilify the Qing state over its ethnic policy. For Chinese nationalists, China would be a sort of 'national empire' or 'imperial nation' – the Han, as the numerical supermajority, would bind together a disparate group of ethnicities under a single national umbrella. We could, if we wanted to, take this same model down a layer: the Han would, itself, be a composite entity on a rather idealised basis, albeit one with somewhat stronger cultural ties between its constituent parts.

Han identity, like any other comparable identity, is one that is essentially artificial, but that it is artificial does not make it meaningless. The only real criteria for an ethnic identity to exist is for people to hold it, and in the case of the Han, that criterion is largely satisfied, at least within mainland China. At the global level however, things are more complicated: the political dynamics that have shaped Han identity in China have been, quite obviously, local ones, and so the conception of Han ethnicity, or just Chinese identification in general, is quite different in the case of diaspora communities, and of Sinitic areas outside the PRC 'core' such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. In such communities, identity distinctions below the Han super-label can be much more pressing: consider anti-mainlander sentiments in Hong Kong, the *waishengren* vs *benshengren* divide on Taiwan, and the fraught relationship with the majority that Hakkas have had in both contexts. Weird as it may be to say, China does not have a monopoly on Chineseness, and we ought not to universalise the PRC's construction of ethnicity.

AskHistorians,Can anyone explain this ancient Greek joke?,"Part of the problem with ancient jokes is that, much like with inside jokes, you really had to be there. Humor has always relied on more a more subtle and familiar type of language, one that wouldn't be recorded in scholarly writings or easily picked up by non-native speakers. Think of how many euphemisms and idioms we use in American English that would be baffling to someone not familiar with baseball.

That being said, there are a few theories from historians as to what the punchline of the joke was. One of the longest-running interpretations (going back to 15th century Italian scholar Giovanni Gioviano Pontano) was that the punchline is the sheer irrelevance of the dunce's answer. The ""dunce,"" as your copy translates it, is a *skholastikòs*, the origin of the word ""scholar."" I've seen it translated variously as ""intellectual,"" ""pedant,"" and ""egghead."" In any case, it's sardonically referring to a man who's ostensibly well-educated, but also a buffoon with zero common sense. So giving an answer that's so subjective that it's effectively useless for the silversmith would be in character.

However, I came across [this paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/671419) published in *Classical Philology* about a decade ago by Prof. Egizia Marie Felice at the University of Reading. In it, she argues that there is another meaning to the word *lúkhnos*, or ""lamp"": it's a name that was also given to a species of fish, one mentioned in Strabo and Pliny's geographies (likely a species different from a modern lanternfish, but the exact species can't be readily determined). Felice argues, therefore, that a more accurate translation would be:

> A *skholastikòs* orders a silversmith to prepare a lantern. When the latter asks him how big he wants it, he replies, ""Like this, for eight people!""

If I had to put Pontano and Felice's interpretations, respectively, in a modern context, it would probably be this:

> A know-it-all goes to Best Buy and shops for a new hard drive. The cashier asks him how big he wants it, and he replies ""One that can hold 10 video games.""

> A know-it-all goes to Best Buy and asks for some Apple products. The cashier asks him what he'd like, and he replies ""a bushelful."""
AskHistorians,Why were Egyptians Arabized in a way Iranians and Turks weren't?,"(1/2) (TL;DR at end of second comment)

First, we have to clarify what we mean by ‘Arab’, and this is not so clear-cut. An extremely restrictive historical definition would refer to members of a group of Semitic-speaking ethnic groups from the Arabian peninsula specifically. An extremely broad definition might include many who come from ‘Arab countries’ or those whose grandparents did but may not themselves speak Arabic, and now live in a non-Arab country. All of these may or may not identify as ‘Arabs’. But allowing for fuzzy definitional boundaries, the core feature used by the Arab League and what most people mean is defined chiefly as those who speak Arabic. Even this carries caveats, due to the wide variety of dialects, and the thorny question of Maltese, so we can say ‘members who speak an Arabic variety and whose communities today use fusha or ‘standard Arabic’ as their standard formal language. 

There was a great deal of migration from the Arabian peninsula during the Islamic expansion and conquests of the early (Rashidun and Umayyad) Caliphate, including to Egypt, as well as later mass migrations like the Banu Hilal confederation in the 11th century, but in most cases the overwhelming majority of the ‘gene pool’ in countries outside the Arabian peninsula, including Egypt, is not from there, but from locals who were culturally ‘Arabised’ during the centuries after Muhammad. 

Within the first few decades of Islam, the effectively the whole Arabian peninsula, Iraq, the Levant, Egypt, the Maghreb, and Iran had been conquered. The chief languages spoken in Iraq and the Levant was Aramaic (arguably already several languages by that point, alongside a large Greek-speaking minority), and Arabic and Aramaic are related Semitic languages. Egypt still spoke Egyptian, at this stage in the form of dialects of Coptic, with a large Greek minority, and the Maghreb (Western North Africa) chiefly spoke Berber languages, with other minority languages (including the now extinct ‘African Romance’, Greek and possibly Vandalic - Punic was extinct by this point). Egyptian and Berber are both related to Arabic, but much more distantly, each forming a separate Afro-Asiatic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family.

Through both persuasion and by laws that conferred major social, economic and legal advantages on Muslims, Islam spread extensively throughout the Caliphate. The social patterns that cause a mass language switch are not entirely uniform through history and a major focus of research, but as a general rule they take centuries of immense pressure, and it is of course not a requirement to speak Arabic as one’s mother tongue to be a Muslim. However, the Umayyads especially, and the Abbasids to a lesser extent, gave Arabs higher social prestige than non-Arab converts, so-called ‘mawālī’. The Umayyads set up their capital at Damascus, in Syria, and this proximity led to Arabic becoming very deeply entrenched there, though even then it was centuries before most Syrians switched to Arabic, and in fact much of the famous translation effort of Greek works under the Caliphate was conducted into Syriac (Syrian Aramaic) first, and then translated again into Arabic. 

When the Abbasids first rose up against the Umayyads, they used far-flung regions of Persia as their base of support, and managed to form a ‘big umbrella’ for various disaffected groups, including some who were religiously heterodox but above all Iranian mawāli, who made up many of their allies and military. This umbrella did not last, but it was formative. 

**Iran**: Persia had been the cultural ‘body’ of the Sassanian Empire just before the Islamic Conquest, and the Persian language is Indo-European - like English, Russian and Hindi - not Afro-Asiatic at all. Not only did this make it far more of a switch to make than between Aramaic and Arabic, it . The Abbasids set up their capital, Baghdad, near where the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon had been (in Iraq), Iranians, and indeed Iraqi Arabic has traces of influence from both Aramaic and Persian. Much of Persia de facto - though not formally - broke away from the Abbasids in the 9th century under the Saffarids, with them and later dynasties like the Buyids and Samanids pushing a resurgence in Persian language and culture in what is known as the ‘Iranian Intermezzo’. (There had in fact been an earlier, brief level of autonomy under the Tahirids, but they had more formal agreements with the Abbasids, and while Iranian were furthermore very Arabised). This further allowed Persian and Islamic culture to be blended even at a courtly level, so that Persian was not seen as ‘a Zoroastrian language’, while still rebelling against Arabisation (there is a loose connection to the history of Iranian Shia here, though several of the earlier dynasties were Sunni). 

Even when Persia fell under Turkic rule and later the Mongols, those new elites converted to Islam and eventually ‘Persianised’ their royal courts, with Persian literature, art and music becoming predominant. This is the hybrid form of Islamic culture, with an Arabic holy book, Turkic rulers but largely Persian culture, that penetrated into what is now India. Other groups in the more isolated centre-north of Iran, among the forests and mountains by the Caspian, had always been somewhat more independent and even included local Zoroastrian dynasties well into the Caliphate. 

Many of these Iranian rulers were also from ‘outer’ regions like Khorasan who had not been as under such close sway as Egypt. 

**Egypt**, however, had a similar but crucially different trajectory. As real Abbasid power outside Iraq crumbled in the 9th century, they also came under de facto independent rulers - but unlike those in Iran, theirs were nearly all non-Egyptian in origin. The first were the Tulunids, who were Turkic, followed by the Ikhshidites, who were also Turkic. Turkic peoples (in the broader sense) had been conquering their way across much of the Steppe and the Abbasids themselves employed them as warriors and generals, eventually seeing some of these generals seize power in various parts of the Caliphate and even at the capital, until the Caliph himself became a largely symbolic ruler. ‘Turks’ thus occupied a very similar role to the Germanic generals in the last century or the Western Roman Empire. 

But most of the ordinary people of Egypt still largely spoke Egyptian, not any Turkic language, so as autonomous from Baghdad as they now were, the lingua franca between these new elites and their people had to be Arabic. This certainly did not change when the Fatimids, a dynasty of *claimed* Arab ancestry going back through the earlier Shiite imams to Muhammad, and which came from the Maghreb and brought in a large Berber military elite, came to power in the 10th century. According to some accounts, the Fatimid ruler Al-Hakim, who was very harsh to non-Muslims, banned Coptic to the degree he would cut off the tongues of anyone he heard speaking it - that said, many later accounts of his rule seem to demonise him with a mix of fact and fiction. The Fatimids also brought in the mass migration of the aforementioned Banu Hilal to keep both locals and other Bedouin tribes (of Arabian origin) in check. Arabic was still the lingua franca when they were replaced by the complex Mamluk ‘dynasty’, which ruled from 1250 to the Ottoman conquest in 1517, and consisted mostly of Circassian and Turkic generals (who usually chose their successors from among their generals, who were in turn formally ‘slaves’, or ‘mamluks’, lit. ‘rules ones’).

AskHistorians,Why did people twiddle toothpicks / matchsticks around their mouths in older media ?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"In 63 BC, did Pompey see the Ark of the Covenant, or was it empty?","I can't answer a couple of the questions that you have here (I don't know if anyone can). I hope I can hazard a good enough answer on what remains, by providing some context for the sources we have. What I will try to do here is talk about what we know about Pompey's visit to the temple and how we know it, what we know about the immediate aftermath of his visit, and then I'll touch on what Pompey ""would have expected"" to see in a temple.

The two main sources I know for this event are Josephus and Tacitus, with a couple questions potentially sourced to the Book of Ezra.

From Tacitus's Histories Book V Chapter 9 we read: 

""The first Roman to subdue the Jews and set foot in their temple by right of conquest was Gnaeus Pompey;​ thereafter it was a matter of common knowledge that there were no representations of the gods within, but that the place was empty and the secret shrine contained nothing. The walls of Jerusalem were razed, but the temple remained standing. Later, in the time of our civil war...[Goes on to talk about what happens 30 years afterward]""

Now, the focus of the Histories was 69-90 CE. So here he is laying the background for Titus Caesar Vespasianus and his siege of Jerusalem, the destruction of the temple, and so on. The section in Book V about Titus around Jerusalem breaks off with the beginning of the siege, then the rest of the book talks about events in Germany. All books after V are lost.

From Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews, Book XIV Chapter 4 we read:

""and no small enormities were committed about the temple itself, which, in former ages, had been inaccessible, and seen by none; for Pompey went into it, and not a few of those that were with him also, and saw all that which it was unlawful for any other men to see but only for the high priests. There were in that temple the golden table, the holy candlestick, and the pouring vessels, and a great quantity of spices; and besides these there were among the treasures two thousand talents of sacred money: yet did Pompey touch nothing of all this, on account of his regard to religion; and in this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue. The next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to cleanse it, and to bring what offerings the law required to God; and restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, both because he had been useful to him in other respects, and because he hindered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any assistance in his war against him.""

Josephus's focus writing here was the event itself, not something a hundred years later, so it is not surprising to find more detail here. What is surprising is that Josephus goes out of his way to say nice things about Pompey, to mention that the temple _did_ have great wealth within it, and that this wealth was not taken.

Shortly afterward, in Book XIV Chapter VII, we read:

""Now Crassus, as he was going upon his expedition against the Parthians, came into Judea, and carried off the money that was in the temple, which Pompey had left, being two thousand talents, and was disposed to spoil it of all the gold belonging to it, which was eight thousand talents.... It was the priest who was guardian of the sacred treasures, and whose name was Eleazar... when he saw that Crassus was busy in gathering money, and was in fear for the entire ornaments of the temple, he gave him this beam of gold as a ransom for the whole, but this not till he had given his oath that he would remove nothing else out of the temple... yet did Crassus take away this beam, upon the condition of touching nothing else that belonged to the temple, and then brake his oath, and carried away all the gold that was in the temple.""

Here, Josephus establishes several things. First, the temple had a great deal of wealth in it, being everything that was there when Pompey left it. Second, Crassus took everything that wasn't nailed down and a beam of gold that was.

I think it unlikely that Josephus thought _Pompey_ raided the temple and blamed someone else. In works of antiquity, often a poet or writer will appeal to common knowledge, or say ""everyone knows X"". To take Tacitus's statement about Pompey in the temple for its rhetorical effect, we are led to think that, at least, highly educated people on the subject would know ""Pompey went into the temple, didn't think much of it, and didn't take anything.""

In Plutarch, neither the Life of Crassus or the Life of Pompey mentions Jerusalem or the temple. All Plutarch says about Judaea in either Life is in Pompey ""he also subdued Judaea, and made a prisoner of Aristobulus the king"" and then it appears as in a list of conquered nations.

In Cassius Dio, Roman History XXVII Chapter 17, as he is describing the Jewish people generally  we read:

""They are distinguished from the rest of mankind in practically every detail of life, and especially by the fact that they do not honour any of the usual gods, but show extreme reverence for one particular divinity. They never had any statue of him even in Jerusalem itself, but believing him to be unnamable and invisible, they worship him in the most extravagant fashion on earth. They built to him a temple that was extremely large and beautiful, except in so far as it was open and roofless...""

So, what would Pompey have expected to find in the temple? So, to a Roman the word ""temple"" meant more of the consecrated district, but I'll continue using it in the common sense, that of ""the building where all the religious stuff is"". The word for ""place a god lives"" is ""aedes"".  The thing that every Roman would expect to find in an aedes was an interior chamber, called a cella. Inside this interior chamber would be a statue or image of the god. For an example of this, we have the (miraculously preserved) [statue of Winged Victory](https://postimg.cc/JHyw5bS8) from a temple in Brescia. It's about 7 feet tall.

So Pompey goes in, walks around. He sees gold, he sees spices and tapestries and priests, he sees a cella. He knows that he would never be permitted to look upon the god in normal circumstances, but he is a conqueror and that gives him every right. He goes within the cella and then... there's no god. No statue, no image, no carving, no nothing. It's just an empty room. This is incredibly weird. Everything else about the temple is normal. He says to himself ""Okay, I'm in the aedes now, now here's the cella, and now... there's no god!?."" It's called a temple, it has priests, it has altars, but it is empty. No one lives there.

To address the fate of the Ark of the Covenant, I hope it is good enough to say ""no one knows"". In Ezra 1 we are given a relatively detailed breakdown of the treasures taken from the temple by Babylon and then returned to the Jewish people by edict of Cyrus. This treasure gets mentioned a couple more times, eventually being weighed to confirm that everything sent from Babylon had arrived. There is no position in historical analysis or in religious tradition that holds that this treasure contained the Ark. There are differing theological explanations for the current position of the Ark, but none of them involve being given back by Babylon- there are theological implications for the Ark not existing, so these explanations do not include ""it got melted down"".

>If such a vital part of the Jewish religion was missing, why did they not record this when they built the 2nd Temple after they returned from Babylonian captivity ~70years later?

I do not mean to be difficult, but questions like ""why did they not record this"" can never be given satisfactory answers. To use an example relevant to sources used here, we have lost much of the work of Tacitus. We have lost almost everything that was ever written in antiquity. All we can say is that we do not have any record, historical or religious, about the literal position of the Ark on this planet after the Babylonian captivity. I will note that if the Ark had been returned to the hands of the Jewish people by Babylon, it would be _absolutely unthinkable_ for this event to not be mentioned in the chronicle of the building of the second temple. They listed out the number of bowls, they would presumably have given a sentence or two to the Ark of the Covenant."
AskHistorians,If Churchill wanted to call Hitler during ww2 could he do so? How much communication was there in ww2 between the various sides and how was it accomplished?,"Unlike during the Cold War period, there was no 'Hotline' or 'Red Phone' connecting the opposing powers - although of course it ought to be noted that however antagonistic at times, the Western and Eastern bloc never got into a direct, shooting conflict anyways. Nor was there an international body like the United Nations which also can serve as a modern conduit for communication between warring powers - the League of Nations nominally continued to exist, but essentially in name only during its last years overlapping with the conflict.

It could, theoretically, have been possible for a direct communication to have been set up between leaders using some pre-determined and likely convoluted arrangement of radio transmission, but I know of no such attempt, or even expression of interest. 

As such, the main focus was, as you suspect, via neutral nations, more often than not being Switzerland, although others too makes an appearance at times when such reach outs were required. Both sides continued to maintain embassies and diplomatic representation with various neutral powers during the war, and as such this allowed lines of communication to be maintained. This would *generally* be done via the neutral power itself, sending a message *through* the Swiss embassy, who would then communicate it to the enemy power, and in turn the response back, but it was also possible for direct communications to happen between diplomats in Switzerland posted to their respective embassies. I'll offer a few examples below to give you a sense of what these various communications ended up looking like

Perhaps the biggest, and most standardized role for interparty communication was in the monitoring of prisoners of war. As agreed to in the 1929 Geneva Convention:

>A central information agency for prisoners of war shall be created in a neutral country. The International Committee of the Red Cross shall propose the organization of such an agency to the interested Powers, if it considers it necessary.

While technically not requiring this to be Switzerland, by virtue of the ICRC being based there, it was practically guaranteed that they were going to end up filling that role. Swiss representatives of the ICRC were thus tasked with ensuring proper treatment of POWs - although they were, for the most part, only *allowed* to play this role when it concerned the western Allies, in the European conflict (both the camps they ran, and their soldiers held as POWs by Germany, but not Japan). The ICRC would collect lists of POWs from the camps and then provide them to the other side. They would act as the conduit for mail and care packages (the latter of which was *overwhelmingly* utilized by the USA). ICRC and Swiss government representatives would provide negotiations over disputes in treatment, such as bringing an end to the 'Shackling Crisis', and generally existed as advocates to ensure good treatment (although there is some irony in that the Swiss were not always good in their treatment of interned military personnel within Switzerland itself, [particularly at Wauwillermoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4rciqp/why_did_hitler_not_invade_switzerland/d505rhv/)).

One particularly strong example I would offer would be the facilitation of prisoner exchanges. This was done several times during the war, and I've written at great length on the matter [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nndfrj/how_were_prisoners_repatriated_to_germany_from/gzvte6z/) so won't rehash the entire matter, but would note that while the Swiss were the primary facilitator for the exchanges, it was a multinational affair that involved transportation through both neutral Sweden and Spain. The linked answer should provide a good sense of how the entire matter functioned and the role of the Swiss in making it happen.

The other, and perhaps most famous, example I would offer would be the final surrender of Japan, which also was facilitated via communication through the neutrals. During the summer of 1945, the first tentative attempts to negotiate an end to the conflict were being sent out, although they were at best too tepid to be of interest to the Allies, and generally unofficial in any case! It is unclear, for instance, just how serious an attempt it was, as the only information seems to have come from intercepts of Japanese SIGINT denying it to be true, but there was *possibly* a group of Japanese diplomats in Sweden who at least had wanted to try and use the Swedes to help negotiate peace talks. The Vatican also saw unsuccessful attempts at establishing communications in June, but they didn't result in anything as it was clear the Japanese were not interested in *unconditional* surrender.

The biggest communication avenue though were, again, the Swiss. These has started all the way back in May, 1945, with Japanese two military attaches posted to Bern trying to convince the Japanese leadership to allow them to begin negotiations through OSS agents in Switzerland. Contact *was* made, but Fujimura and Nishihara were essentially acting without sanction as their urgings were ignored, and on June 20th they were explicitly stripped of authority, bringing their nascent attempts to a halt. They weren't the only ones, but in all cases, whether from HUMINT sources or thanks to the fact the Allies were reading Japanese mail almost as quick as the intended recipients thanks to MAGIC, which meant that they were well aware that all these attempts were essentially meaningless as to the clear and unwavering desire for Japan's unconditional surrender. Further more, the fact that the communications -or attempts - were being done through individuals, rather than the government, furthr reinforced how weak they were. Frank highlights a memo from late June, 1945, that summarizes the matter:

>While neutral observers in Japan have mentioned a desire for peace in unofficial and some official cir­cles, and a number of Japanese representatives abroad have urged a negoti­ated peace (as distinguished from unconditional surrender), until now the Japanese traffic out of Tokyo has contained only reiterations of Japan's de­ termination to ""fight to the bitter end.""

In the wake of the atomic bombs and the entry of the USSR into the conflict, the Japanese leadership's discussions of the 9th and 10th of August resulted in the decision to surrender to the Allied powers, and this was, as you might suspect, done through the Swiss, although it can be noted that the role they played was, as Schwarz terms it, done ""in a technical way and without any material int­ervention"". Their role was entirely as passive participants, moving communications between the parties. Perhaps if unconditional surrender had never been on the table, they would have played a more active role in mediating the negotiations.

So there are definitely many more examples which others might be able to chime in with, but that at least hopefully gives you some sense of what communications between the warring powers looked like and how they happened. Neutral powers played a vital role in providing a conduit, some of which was established by treaty. The two main examples offered I hope show two very different situations, the first being a lower level, but constant link between the enemy powers, and the second being higher level, context dependent communications, in this case for the purpose of ending the war, with those communications possible both through individuals who had contacts in those neutral nations that they could reach out to directly, as was attempted in the early summer, or through official communications via telegram done at the government level, with the neutral power providing the 'switchboard' to pass along the notes.

AskHistorians,Did Hitler believe his own propaganda about Jewish people?,"Hitler was a true believer, but your instinct that the Jews were a convenient scapegoat is also likely correct. 

Hitler himself tells us in Mein Kampf that he first became an antisemite during his time living in Vienna prior to the First World War. However, this claim is disputed by historians, as a Jew was one of his most frequent buyers (he supported himself at this time partially as a painter), and we don’t have any surviving writings of his that would indicate a clear-cut antisemitic worldview at this time. 

During his time in Austria, Hitler was exposed to the ideas of an Austrian politician named Georg Ritter von Schönerer, who was a prominent pan-Germanist and anti-Semite. Without going into too much detail, a key component of von Schönerer’s beliefs (and political organizations) was that Jews were not and could never be Germans; a pan-German movement was thus inextricably and explicitly anti-Jewish. 

The mayor of Vienna at the time of Hitler’s residence was Karl Lueger, another influential Austrian politician. Leuger was not a pan-Germanist, but he was an avowed anti-Semite. Lueger was moreover an expert political actor who understood that the Viennese tradesmen and petit-bourgeois voting bloc traditionally blamed many of their problems on Jews; as a result, Lueger understood that publicly aligning himself against Jews would create a more favorable political situation for himself. 

These early influences combined with the experiences of Hitler in post-war Germany, where Jews were already being fingered as the cause of Germany’s defeat, crystallized Hitler’s views. He believed sincerely - so far as can be told - in his virulent (and later violent) anti-Semitism, but he also understood that such a position would be politically favorable to himself and his party.

I would preface of course first to say that trying to find logic in racial pseudoscience is often an exercise in futility. Thinkers almost always contradict in some way as they each are, in the end, creating their own proofs for an untruth, and even single theories often have obvious points of contradiction and inconsistency. But in any case, that dispensed with, the term ""Aryan"" as we think of it in the strains of racial pseudoscience where it is most commonly associated with Nazism is most significantly a result of the writings of Arthur de Gobineau, a Frenchman with pretensions of aristocracy (self-styled as Comte de Gobineau) writing in the mid-1800s, and best known for our purposes for this work *Essai sur l’Inégalité des Races Humaines*. 

Gobineau wasn't doing anything particularly new in his approach to writing on ideas of race and his work reflected common ideas of a noble Germanic race which was superior to all, terms the ""Nordic"" myth, and which traces back at least another century to the writings of another Frenchman, Henri de Boulainvilliers, and which subdivided the people of France into the Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean types, placing the Nordics at the top, and exemplifying them as, put succinctly, the ""descendants of ancient Germanic tribes, the originators of all civilization, and the only peoples capable of leadership"".

Gobineau took this and expanded on it, but writing in the 1850s, added onto it new ideas which had entered into the intellectual milieu of the time, and one of these was the use of the term ""Aryan"", which although first applied in India, was a linguistic term created by a British official to describe the ur-language shared by a vast swathe of the globe, what we would now term Indo-European. The idea of Aryanness language was promoted by several figures before Gobineau, but he made it essentially his own with the way he melded it to racial thinking. The logic of course was quite simple, if the Nordics were the originators of all civilization, and Aryan language the roots of all language, presumably the Aryans and the Nordics were the same thing. But of course he doesn't stop there either, adding in ideas about purity of the blood and corruption caused by mixing of the races. 

Whites were the superior race, Aryans the best of the whites, and mixing with the inferior races - ""White"", ""Yellow"", ""Black"", which he based on the three sons of Noah -  risked the very existence of civilization itself. The purer the Aryan blood, the better the civilization, the weaker, the worse. Aryans had propagated far and wide - settling Europe, Iran, and India -  hence why traces were found even in the latter, but even in Europe, where the Germanics represented the purest specimen remaining, they faced great dangers of decline which Gobineau already believed to be well advanced and needed to be arrested quickly. Gobineau was hardly ignorant of the place of India in all of this, and in fact based much of his work on readings of the *Rig Veda* which he believed supported the story of Genesis. Figueria summarizes other Sanskrit literature he drew on thusly, using them as evidence for the eventual degradation of the Aryans in india due to dilution from long intermingling with the ""aborigines"":

>The *Mahabharata* bore witness to the manner in which Indian society had been invaded by foreign elements.9 Savage vices, absent from the *Ramayana*, appear full-blown in the history of the Pandavas, who had been raised to divine status in order to veil the blood sins of their mothers. In other words, Gobineau read the epics as chronicles of non-Aryan promiscuity and Aryan battles to avoid the dilution of their bloodlines.

This he held up as a warning for what Germany was going through, and the threat to Aryan purity of the Germanics, which they needed to work to stop.

Later thinkers built off this further. Ernst Haeckel's *The Riddle of the Universe: At the Close of the Nineteenth Century* would prove to be an especially influential one in his specific focus on tying in the Aryan Myth with Germanic nationalism and ideas of *Volk*, and the preeminence of the blonde, blue-eyed ideal, which of course are so closely entwined with the popular image of Nazi ideas which would come later. 

But perhaps none is a more important bridge between Gobineau and the Nazis than Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who wrote *Foundations of the Nineteenth Century*. An Englishman by birth, he was fascinated by *Germanness*, marrying Wagner's daughter, and writing German propaganda through the First World War. *Foundations* pushed the Aryan Myth heavily, and was a work admired by Hitler himself, and of many things, is known for being a key part of the attempt to demonstrate that Jesus was, in fact, not Jewish but of Aryan persuasion, which of course ties into the virulent anti-Semitism pushed by all of the writers mentioned here, Chamberlain being a key part in developing Hitler's belief that the Jews needed to be entirely removed from German society.

It also of course it worth mentioning the American Madison Grant who wrote *The Passing of the Great Race: or The Racial Basis of European History* which likewise played in important part in the propagation of the Aryan Myth, and played a key role in the creation of the eugenics movement in early 20th c. America.

But in any case, that is the rough summary of it all. ""*Aryan*"" was a term latched onto by 19th century thinkers for their writings on racial pseudoscience as it fit well with their ideas of a master race, a ruling class, which had once been spread far and wide. Gobineau, as did others, used esoteric and wildly ahistorical readings of texts and evidence to support this view, explain away incongruities, and place their Germanic ideal in the place of this master race in their way of thinking. Although India was a key part of the origin of the term ""Aryan"", these racial thinkers were careful to explain why India itself, of course, was not the exemper of the Aryan race, and instead held it up as an example of how far the white race could fall.

AskHistorians,"Where did the 'Random Stuff on the Walls' restaurant decor aesthetic (i.e 'Applebee's-core') come from, and why was it seemingly so widespread in the late 90s-2000s?","It's generally accepted by casual-dining connoisseurs and design historians alike that the aesthetic you describe was popularized by the restaurant chain Max & Erma’s of Columbus, Ohio. The first Max & Erma’s Tavern was opened by Max and Erma Visocnik in the city’s German Village neighborhood in 1958. The restaurant was known for its juicy hamburgers and its eclectic decor, which included vintage signs, antiques, and collectibles. The homey atmosphere and homestyle cooking proved to be a massive success, leading to the creation of the Max & Erma’s corporation in 1972. 

Riding a wave of baby-boomer nostalgia, the Max & Erma’s chain expanded from 10 locations in the Midwest in 1982 to over 55 throughout the US by the year 2000. The cluttered walls, dark wood, brass fittings, and ferns set the restaurant apart from its main competitors in the family-friendly dining market. By the early 2000s, the company was spending $40,000 to decorate each new or remodeled restaurant. Back in Columbus, a dedicated 6,500-square-foot warehouse contained 2,600 cataloged and barcoded objects ready to adorn the walls of one of the company’s locations. Each Max & Erma’s was decorated with about 350 objets (including some reproductions among the genuine articles), along with a selection of historical photos of the original German Village tavern and a few items of local interest, such as sports jerseys or memorabilia relating to local industries. 

The evocative power of so many knick-knacks and tchotchkes led other restaurant chains—from Friday’s to Applebee’s to Red Robin—to copy Max & Erma’s success. With so many imitators, Max & Erma’s found that its decor was no longer special or distinctive but dark, stuffy, and overdone. Out went the polished oak finishes and Tiffany lampshades, and in came birch and cherry veneers and Venetian blown-glass pendants. By 2006, a diner could no longer enter a Max & Erma's location expecting to be greeted by a taxidermy rhinoceros head or a six-foot fiberglass chicken."
AskHistorians,"The cannons at Edinburgh Castle have what appears to be a dollar sign on one side of the pivot. Does anyone know what this indicates? I assume this symbol predates the US dollar, since the cannons likely do as well.","It is part of a system of marking the cannon to identify such things as the foundry that made them. The ends of the pivots (formally called trunnions) are a popular place to mark, since they will usually be visible. The markings can be very helpful in identifying the history of individual cannon.

The Royal Armouries website provides information about 18-pounders at Edinburgh Castle [here](https://collections.royalarmouries.org/object/rac-object-2398.html), and includes a note that ""The bowling Ironworks of Bowling Manor, near Bradford, began trading in foundry and smith's work in 1784. In 1788 largely due to the efforts of the ironmaster John Sturges of Wakefield, they started smelting iron ore in quantity. The company supplied the Board of Ordnance with cast-iron guns and mortars throughout the Napoleonic Wars, *the letter S stamped on the trunnions being their identification letter*.""

AskHistorians,My American friend's great-grandfather was Finnish and he was documented as 'Asian' in his papers. Was this something that happened commonly with Finnish immigrants in the late 1800's?,"This is absolutely possible. 

During the first half of the 20th century, there were continuous discussions in the United States about the definition of ""whiteness"", specifically, which ethnic (or, as they were called at the time 'racial') groups were considered white and which one were not. As you can imagine, whether or not a person was considered white or not could have serious social and legal implications. You may have seen signs from turn-of-the-century New York saying ""Irish need not apply"", which is a very visceral representation of the whiteness debate. 

Socially marginalized groups, which included immigrants, the Italian and Irish examples being most well-known examples, but also people that had been present in what would later become a part of the United States (such as the Cajuns of Southwest Louisiana, which was integrated into the US after the Louisiana purchase) were not perceived as whites. In Louisiana, where French-speakers, particularly those of Black or mixed origins (*gens de couleur libres)* saw their rights retroactively taken away as the state increasingly implemented anti-Black legislatures, both in the pre-Civil War and post-Reconstruction periods. It was only after the abolition of Jim Crow and desegregation that groups traditionally considered to be 'not white' came to be seen as white, a move that must primarily be seen as one borne out of political necessity. 

The point is that discussions surrounding 'racial' or ethnic identity are rarely self-evident, particularly in the context of the United States. So how is this related to the case of Finnish Americans? In a paper from 2011, Kivisto and Leinonen point out the case of a Finnish immigrant, named John Svan, born in Noormakku, Finland, but had moved to the United States in 1900. When Svan applied for naturalization, the district attorney held up his case, stating ""as a Finn, he is a Mongolian and not a 'white person' (Kivisto & Leinonen 2011:12). 

Where did this come from? The inclusion of Finns into a Mongolian (or 'Mongoloid') race was based on ethno-linguistic arguments. Finnish, along with Estonian and Hungarian (and several other smaller languages) is a Finno-Ugric/Uralic language and although the field of human genetics was still in its infancy, there had already been a trend starting from the 18th century that sought to divide Europe's peoples into neat racial categories. With an awareness growing that the Finns shared certain cultural and linguistic features with the Finno-Ugric peoples of Central Russia (which, in turn, have many commonalities with their Turkic neighbors), various peoples inhabiting a region spanning from Finland and Estonia in west to Korea in the East were all grouped under a single 'Mongol' racial category. 

Although Svan eventually won his court case, and as a result, Finns broadly came to be considered 'whites', there was still a sense of racial anxiety that remained within the Finnish-American community over the next fifty years. This anxiety was so strong that in 1957, with funding from the *Knights of Kaleva* (a Finnish fraternal organization) Saul Olin published a book entitled: *Finlandia: The Racial Composition, the Language and a Brief History of the Finnish People* with the express purpose of proving that Finns were, indeed, white.

AskHistorians,"If I were a simple layperson in medieval Europe what would be my best bet to learn how to read and write? Would I even want to? If it were possible, what material could I hope to read?","Your typical adult has few “formal” means to learn to read and write, and you named most of them, but there could be contacts in his city section, town, village, etc. that might be able to help learn in a more informal manner. 

Quick disclaimer though, I’ll be basing this answer on information found in *A Social and Cultural History of Early Modern France* by William Beik, which obviously means the answer will primarily apply to France, but won’t be too dissimilar from other areas of western and Central Europe. And the answer will primarily deal with the 14th century onward. While the title focused on the early modern, it really begins the discussion in the 14th century. The book tracks trends up through the 18th century, but I’ll stick to information that would’ve applied specifically to the late medieval as well.

First, I’ll add that there’s a chance, as a commoner, especially if you’re a man, you may have learned to read and write as a child and young adult. Starting in the late medieval period, many towns, villages, city sections, started establishing local primary and secondary schools for the communities. These would’ve had virtually no official regulation, so quality of instruction could vary dramatically, and they were typically thrown together by town councils run by prominent members of the community, with the classrooms likely just being a certain room in the local church. The teachers were typically lower clergy, and usually were native to their communities and had a strong communal connection, however some were hired from elsewhere and not all teachers came from the clergy. *Most* of these teachers would know how to read and write, especially in the cities, but it wasn’t uncommon for poorer peasant communities in the rural countryside to make whatever they had work, and sometimes that meant even their “teacher” was uneducated and couldn’t read or write. Schools were seen as prestigious, so as time went on most communities tried very hard to open their own schools, and often these schools would be funded by basically local fundraising. There wasn’t really any national budget for schooling. *Occasionally* you might have a lord here or there mandate that their community open a school, but very rarely would this be funded by the lord, and the community would generally have to figure out fundraising on their own.

In your post you mentioned the example of a blacksmith. Depending on rank and guild affiliation, and especially in the cities, a man may already know how to read and write through their guild training. Or even a woman. After all there were many guilds open to both men and women. Some artisan guilds even allowed women in high ranks and leadership roles, and indeed there were also guilds that pulled the reverse, and men were not allowed, only women. Guild literacy would’ve been far more common in cities where cities often had special legal privileges for certain guilds, local regulations existed, taxes, tariffs, etc. Guilds would’ve needed to stay up to date on this information and as such there’s a decent chance higher ranked artisans would know how to read or write.

If you’re an adult and didn’t learn through either of the above methods, there might be other ways or people you know who might be able to teach you.

Of course, you could go to a college to learn, but you mentioned not being interested in scholarly or clergy methods of learning, and I assume this will also apply to fields like law or medicine, which would also require the ability to read or write and students would learn that in colleges. While these were not cheap, commoners could make it work and many did go to college. In fact college, through the legal profession, was the most common way for peasants to enter the nobility, since many legal clerk, notary, or other positions were reserved for nobles, and if you were qualified and landed a job, it was possible to be granted nobility, which was actually much more open than a lot of people would probably expect. College was expensive, but for a city section, a small village, or even a family, it was extremely prestigious for the community, and it wasn’t uncommon for a village community to pool together money so they could send their brightest young adults to college in the cities for a shot at a better life and maybe even nobility, whether it was to send them to college for law, or clergy, both had paths to noble ranks for commoners. And maybe after they graduate, this hot new, young lawyer, physician, or priest could come back to the village and fill one of these important jobs for the community they grew up in.

This is where I would say is the “best bet” for learning to read and write if none of the above options apply. No matter how poor your little community is, whether it’s a single dense street in Paris, or a tiny village in Brittany, there are likely members of your community who can read and write, and you’d just need to know who they are, and ask them nicely to teach you. Your local priest probably grew up with you in most communities. You could get with your childhood friend and ask him. Your community probably has some kind of legal clerk to assist with your local lord’s court, and same thing. There’s a very high chance that this clerk grew up in your community and was one of those “bright kids” that the community fundraised to go to college. If not a legal clerk, your community may have a notary, tax collector, or accountant, which in this period all came from basically the same college education in law, and most of these people would be able to read and write. If you’re an artisan, it’s almost guaranteed that *someone* in your guild can read and write, so they could teach you as well.

But that about sums up the most common commoners that know how to read and write so you could find them to learn. There are other possibilities, but they would’ve been less common, such as being taught by your lord, which some lords were super strong pillars of their communities and hired locals for odd jobs on their estates, but while an option, it probably wouldn’t be likely. 

There would often also be quite wealthy peasants in the community, entrepreneurial families that have slowly gobbled up farmland over generations. In some cases, these wealthy peasants could make almost as much as, and in some cases more money, than their lords. These peasants are likely following my favorite method of attaining nobility, and that would’ve been what I like to call the “fake it til you make it” method, a long con. As such, these wealthy peasants would have a much higher chance of literacy seeing they would want to appear noble and educated in any way they could, but unfortunately that would also mean distancing themselves from other peasants so they probably wouldn’t be too much help most of the time.

I hope this helps, and I hope it fits the standards for this sub."

AskHistorians,"How accurate is the saying ""you don't make money during the gold rush mining gold, you make the money selling the shovels"" to the actual Gold Rush? Did those providing ancillary goods and services actually make more money than those seeking the gold?","I finally get to answer! I hope this passes the bar. 
I have worked at historic sites in British Columbia for the better part of the last 10 years, with a focus on the Cariboo gold rush starting in 1858.

Common figures from this time, in this region are that roughly 10% of gold-seekers made a profit, the top 4% made a profit worth mentioning, and the top 1% made it rich. 

The average working man in this time made about a dollar a day in wages. The price of gold was fixed by the colonial government at $19.87 an ounce.

The government put in naval blockades and checkpoints at the most popular routes through the colony to the gold fields, ensuring they got their share of the profits from selling gold licenses.

Places like Fort Langley sold goods for gold-seekers at highly inflated prices. Remember these men were making a dollar a day? These men were paying $2-4 a gold pan, $5 a shovel, and similarly highly inflated prices for all other goods and provisions. BC was sparsely colonized at this time and there were not really any other options. You paid through the nose, or you didn't get the supplies you needed.

On the road to the gold fields, things were no better. You could spend 6 months walking to the gold fields, or you could spend $20 to catch a stage coach from Bernards Express to get there in a much shorter time. Note that this did not buy you a seat, it bought you the opportunity to cram yourself in/on and hang on for dear life, as tickets were sold to as many as could cling to the stagecoaches.

Roadhouses along the Cariboo wagon road were similarily cutthroat in their extortion of these gold-seekers. $1/night to sleep on the floor. $2 for a bed in a shared room. $3 for a private room (until they ran out of space and started double-booking your private room too.)

In the gold fields, in boom towns like Barkerville, prices were similarily high, with some unique ""scams"" being run. There are reports of laundries offering free laundering to gold seekers, who would then gold pan the laundry water and find more than their fair share of gold dust lost and forgotten in pockets and seams. Saloons watered doen their good whiskey, and made their own (to circumvent government taxing of liquor) with turpentine and gunpowder. Men could pay in cash or ""species"" (gold) and the gold would be taxed by all sorts of so-called transportation fees, storage fees, handling fees, that brought the in-saloon exchange rate down to $15 an ounce  Whenever the saloon closed, they swept the floors and panned the dust for, you guessed it, more gold.


For a reference point, the current minimum wage in BC is $$16.75 an hour, x8 is $134 per day of work. We'll round up to $200 a day, say we're all decently paid blue collar workers.
That made the cost of sleeping on a dirt floor $200, a shovel $1000, a ride on the BX at $4000. All to seek gold you aren't likely to find, at what amounts to nearly $4000/an ounce in todays terms. Mining the miners was indeed the way to go.

Sources: Official Provincial/Federal Gov't traning manuals for these historic sites, training by senior heritage interpreters, and on-site interpretive panels. I have a mind like a sieve for books and authors, so I cannot reference those directly, apologies.

EDIT: to add that the European population of BC was less than 5000 at the start of the Cariboo gold rush. In the first year, 30 000 American gold seekers crossed the border, which precipitated the proclamation of the colony of BC.
They were starting wars and signing treaties with local indigenous people, which Britain reallllly did not like in their ""territory""

Fun fact! 

Fort Kamloops knew about gold in the area more than 10 years prior, but kept it a secret because gold=people, and the more people are there, the fewer furs the HBC can get in the fur trade.

They held onto the gold traded to them until they had 3000 ounces. That amount triggeres their oh-shit reflex, and they sent it down in secrecy to San Francisco to be minted and sold. Did it stay a secret? No, no it did not.

A couple ounces here and there, no one would have noticed. But 3000 ounces, just as the California '49 gold rush was winding down... got peoples attention. The rest, is history"
AskHistorians,What did people do in the morning before coffee was discovered?,"This answer deals with the Classical Greeks, so slightly earlier than Alexander the Great, but similar practices will have applied. The basic answer is that we should imagine something much less organised or regular than our own morning rituals. There was no particular drink around which to gather, and not necessarily any gathering at all. Breakfast might not even be the first order of the day.

At dawn, a Greek army in the field consisted simply of a large number of people who each had to attend to their own business. There were no quartermasters or cooks (except among the Spartans) and every person had to look after their own needs. There does not generally seem to have been a centralised signal to rise or a set order of actions that the men and women of the camp were expected to take. Instead, those who needed water would go find water; those who needed to cook would go out to gather firewood; those who needed to relieve themselves would find the allocated spot; those who had horses would tend to their horses; all this time, others might still be asleep. We get some sense of what this part of the day would have looked like from Xenophon's account of Thrasyboulos' surprise attack on the army of the Thirty of Athens in 403 BC:

> Then when it was drawing towards day and the enemy were already getting up and going away from their camp whithersoever each one had to go, and the grooms were keeping up a hubbub as they curried their horses, at this moment Thrasyboulos and his men picked up their arms and charged on the run. They struck down some of the enemy and turned them all to flight, pursuing them for six or seven stadia [about 1200-1400m]; and they killed more than 120 of the hoplites, and among the cavalry Nikostratos, nicknamed “the beautiful,” and two more besides, catching them while still in their beds.

-- Xenophon, *Hellenika* 2.4.6

The sense of disorder and lack of direction that we get from this scene was one reason why dawn attacks were often very effective. Xenophon himself, in the guide to strategy he included in his *Education of Kyros* (1.6.36), recommends dawn as a perfect time to strike:

> “And how, father,” said Kyros, “could one catch the enemy making such mistakes?”

> “Why, my son,” said Kyaxares, “both you and the enemy must necessarily offer many such opportunities; for instance, you must both eat, and you must both sleep, and early in the morning you must almost all at the same time attend to the calls of nature, and you must make use of such roads as you find. All this you must observe, and you must be particularly watchful on the side where you know yourselves to be weaker, and you must attack the enemy above all in that quarter in which you see that they are most vulnerable.” 

This time of vulnerability - sometimes literally catching the enemy with his pants down - could last particularly long if everyone took time to cook breakfast. As I said earlier, there were no quartermasters to arrange this centrally. Instead, food had to be created from scratch: fires made (with friction drills or flint), grain milled into flour, bread baked, and toppings made out of anything that was to hand. On the morning after the battle of Kounaxa, Xenophon and the mercenaries of the Ten Thousand had no flour, so they spent the morning butchering pack animals for sustenance; we are told that by the time they were done it was almost noon (*Anabasis* 2.1.6-7). Even if the army carried embers to share fire, it would have taken hours before the food was ready and everyone had eaten. Until that point the men might only have had water or milk to drink. Wine, mixed with water, went with the meal, if it was available.

As you can imagine, commanders who felt that their forces were vulnerable or who did not want to waste half the day getting ready might order the men to move before they ate. They might arrange to meet other officers before dawn, draw up plans for the day, and wake the army to carry them out immediately. We hear of armies completing half a day's march, or moving and refortifying their camp, or even fighting a pitched battle before breakfast. In those cases the only thing the troops would have had time to do when they got up was take a piss, maybe drink some water, and pack up their belongings or put their armour on, depending on whether they were told to march or fight.

AskHistorians,Was Johnny Cash the first US citizen to hear that Joseph Stalin was dead?,"What Johnny Cash actually told his biographer was as follows:

> I had such a talent for that particular line of work and such a good left ear, that in Landsberg, where the United States Air Force Security Service ran radio intercept operations worldwide, I was the ace. I was who they called when the hardest jobs came up. I copied the first news of Stalin’s death. I located the signal when the first Soviet jet bomber made its first flight from Moscow to Smolensk; we all knew what to listen for, but I was the one who heard it. 

He didn’t say that he was the first to know the news. In fact, if we make the obvious assumption that the news was in Russian and encoded, he didn’t know what he was copying at all. His telling of this story is at least possible, if we accept that a Morse code signal preceded official announcement of Stalin’s death and that Cash was informed of the contents of his signal after it was decrypted.

However, [veterans of the USAFSS](https://usafss19481979.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/johnnycashusafss-note-1.pdf) doubt even this interpretation, for two reasons: (1) veterans of that era don’t remember this incident at all, which surely would have been momentous when it happened, and (2) it’s unclear why a ”low level Russian radio operator” would have received this news before it was officially announced by the Soviet Communist Party.

Cash's account could still be accurate; it's also possible that Cash was simply listening to Radio Moscow in English at the right moment, or that he was exaggerating to emphasize the security importance of the messages he was decoding at the time of Stalin’s death. It is true that [USAFSS servicemen apparently learned of many incidents before they hit the newspapers](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=685050541900190&id=145731189165464), which makes any exaggeration easy to understand.

I would argue that Dante's *Inferno* does not in fact dominate the imagination of a Christian afterlife, or at least not as much as one might expect. Certainly, some features, such as the architecture of Hell being based on circles and the role played by fire (in the seventh and eighth circle) and devils (eighth circle), are indeed featured in *Inferno*, but other, often more original, elements tend to be ignored.

The pit of Hell in *Inferno*, for instance, is a place of freezing temperatures and an icy lake (*Inferno* XXXII-XXXIII), no doubt reflecting theological understandings of evil as absence of good (and its common metaphors of warmth and light). The idea is explored as early as the first circle of Limbo (*Inferno* IV) and is arguably indebted to pre-Christian representations of Hell in Homer (*Odyssey* XI) and Virgil (*Aeneid* VI), which were even preceded by the Mesopotamian *Epic of Gilgamesh*. Fire, then, is not the dominant means of punishment in *Inferno*; if anything, it is associated, etymologically as well as literally, with the second realm, *Purgatorio*, the place of the purging souls 'that are content | in the fire' (*Inferno* I, 118-119). In *Inferno*, devils are confined to specific circles and they are often represented not as seriously terrifying, but as over-the-top, farcical characters, famously farting about ('and he had made a trumpet of his ass', *Inferno* XXI, 139).

But Dante's *Inferno* also differs from popular understandings of Hell, before as well as after Dante, in more subtle ways. Eileen Gardner's very helpful *Visions of Heaven and Hell before Dante* (mentioned by u/Whoosier) shows that over the course of the Middle Ages sexual sinners were regularly represented stripped naked, their hair either cut or pulled, and their genitals tormented. In contrast with these sexualised depictions of lust, the text of Dante's *Inferno* is remarkable for how de-sexualised it is (as argued by the excellent Teodolinda Barolini, 'Dante and Cavalcanti: On Making Distinctions in Matters of Love'). In *Inferno*, the lustful are depicted with relative dignity, buffeted by wind as in life they were buffeted by passion (*Inferno* V), while the sodomites strightforwardly run in circles under a rain of fire (*Inferno* XIV-XVI). This aspect of the *Commedia*, which was certainly innovative and arguably more compassionate, has not been as influential in overhauling the violent and sexualised representation of the torments that preceded it.

But arguably the biggest influence Dante did have was in the representation not of Hell, but of the mountain of Purgatory. While ideas of Hell pre-date Christianity, Purgatory was a relatively new invention by the Catholic Church. Dante's *Purgatory* (the second book of his trilogy known as *Divine Comedy*) was incontrovertibly the most influential work in the imagination of this new realm, as explained by historian Jacques Le Goff in his landmark *The Birth of Purgatory*.

In short, the influence of Dante's Hell has been limited to select features, many of which were not original. And if you ask me, the most interesting bits are often the ones popular understandings of the *Commedia* have overlooked.

AskHistorians,How did historians on the Holocaust come to a consensus on the facts and are there any *genuine* (not antisemitic driven) debates about these facts?,"There have been *many* points of contention within the academy, and there always will be *something* that people approaching the topic in good faith won't agree on, but perhaps the *biggest* debate in the historiography of Holocaust scholarship would be that between the 'Functionalists' and 'Intentionalists', which is essentially disagreements on *why the Holocaust happened*, with, in the briefest of descriptions, one side seeing it as bottom up and the other as top down. There are a number of positions that notable Holocaust scholars have staked out on the topic, usually lumped into 'Hard' and 'Soft', or 'Extreme' and 'Moderate', of the two respective umbrellas (and also the ""both sides have valid points which should be integrated!"" position, of course). I wouldn't say the debate is *completely* settled, but it is no longer nearly as central as it was in the '80s and '90s (arguably the moderate Functionalist position ""won"", and is what you'll find as 'default' in recent works. That doesn't mean *everyone* agrees, but it is the 'default').

AskHistorians,"Where did our modern stereotypical image of a caveman come from, where they wear loin clothes, carry a big club, grunt, hunt sabertooth tigers, and live in a cave come from? And where does the term “caveman” originate?","Although our stereotype of prehistoric humans dates from the 19th century, much of the stereotypical ""caveman"" imagery was borrowed from a couple of older sources:

1. According to ancient Greek and Roman geographies, the *Trogodytai* (Τρωγοδύται) were an indigenous people of North Africa and the Red Sea region. Account differed in the details, but most ancient writers described the *Trogodytai* as simple hunter-gatherers who lived in the wilderness, subsisted on small game, and spoke in grunts, hisses, and squeaks. Many manuscripts include an ""l"" in the name (*Troglodytai*), which changes the meaning to ""cave-goer"" (τρώγλη, ""hole, cave"" + δύτης, ""one who dives, descends, enters""). This variant, and the association with cave-dwelling, would win out in the long run; it also gives us the modern word ""troglodyte"" and the scientific nomenclature for chimpanzees (*Pan troglodytes*). If you take a look at late medieval illustrations of the *Troglodytai*, you'll see caves, clubs, animal hides, and bushy hair, motifs that would go on to inform later depictions of prehistoric humans. For example, take a look at the Troglodytae in *Le secret de l'histoire naturelle contenant les merveilles et choses mémorables du monde* (15th century): BnF, MS Français 22971, [fol. 13r](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52508970d/f31).
2. The medieval ""wild man"" (*homo silvestris*) was a semi-mythical character that appeared frequently in late medieval literature and art, especially in German-speaking regions. Wild people were usually depicted with bushy body hair (men and women), carrying clubs, and living a simple hunter's life in the forest. Perusing late medieval and early modern depictions of wild people, you'll again find lots of ""caveman"" imagery: e.g. Albrecht Dürer's ""[Sylvan Men](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ADurerWoodwoses1499.jpg)"" (1499); Martin Shongauer, ""[Shield with Greyhound Held by Wild Man](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/336194)"" (1470-91); an anonymous [Basel wall tapestry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilder_Mann#/media/Datei:Tugendreiche_Dame_z%C3%A4hmt_Wildmann.png) (1470/80); and the illustrations of *Sigenot* in Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg, Cod. Pal. germ. 67, fols. [15v--22r](https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg67/0036/image,info,thumbs).

It's worth noting that neither the *Troglodytai* nor the *homines silvestres* were considered ""prehistoric"" *per se*. Both streams would go on to influence European depictions of real-world peoples, such as indigenous Canary Islanders, Americans, Africans, and Australians. The same stock imagery was recycled again with the discovery of prehistoric hominids who had lived in the caves and forests of Europe.

AskHistorians,How did New Age and offshoot movement become so obsessed with (often pseudo-)“Native American” culture?,"As with many aspects of New Age and alternative wellness belief systems, it seems like this obsession goes back to the 19th century. In the late 19th century, North America experienced the rise of many alternative health and wellness movements, as well as spiritual movements. Many of these are direct ancestors of the New Age. There’s New Thought, which is basically the same thing as The Secret; Theosophy, which imported exoticized versions of Eastern religions into the West; and medicine shows, in which people selling all sorts of health remedies toured the country and put on shows to impress potential customers (incuding the infamous snake oil salesmen).

At the same time, anthropology emerged as a form of study of human lives and societies. According to [historian Philip Jenkins’s book](https://librarysearch.library.utoronto.ca/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991105970059206196&context=L&vid=01UTORONTO_INST:UTORONTO&lang=en&search_scope=UTL_AND_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,dream%20catchers%20how%20mainstream%20america%20discovered%20native%20spirituality&offset=0) about the American settler relationship to Indigenous spiritualities, this mainstreamed some vague knowledge about Native American ceremonies and beliefs, and normalized them as an object of study or fascination (as opposed to earlier assumptions that they were superstitious or dangerous). He ties this to the strengthening of a stereotype of “noble savages”, which stereotyped Indigenous people as uncorrupted by the ills of civilization and industrialization, and thus a lot more spiritual and in touch with nature than mainstream American culture. Works by these anthropologists also made elements of Indigenous spirituality accessible to Americans through books, as did travellers’ accounts of people visiting Indigenous communities and reporting back in an exoticized tone.

So, for aspiring medicine show sellers, tapping into this image of an undespoiled culture that knew a lot about nature could be lucrative. Although other cultures were also appropriated for this purpose, it became pretty popular to sell cure-alls or fake remedies named after Indigenous cultures (even if the actual recipes had nothing to do with Indigenous people).Ferris State University’s [article about anti-Indigenous stereotypes](https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/native/homepage.htm) lists a few examples of these pretendian medicine show products: Kickapoo Indian Salve, Big Chief Liniment, and Indian Stomach Bitters. Jenkins cites this as a cultural influence that put the idea of ancient Native healing secrets into the American consciousness.

By the end of the century, this image of Indigenous people as possessing ancient secrets and a unique connection to nature passed into American fine art and literature. Western artists and tourists frequently visited Southwestern Indigenous communities like the Hopi for events like the snake dance, and integrated their impressions into their art. Poets like George Cronyn extolled the naturalness and simplicity of Indigenous life, and a collective of artists called the Taos Society based themselves in Pueblo territory and used Pueblo, Hopi and Navajo motifs, among other notable poets and members of the Arts and Crafts movement. The appeal of these Native motifs were strongly based on the idea that Indigenous spirituality was special: for instance, writer Mary Austin claimed to have been forever changed by an experience with a Paiute medicine man, writing that she thought she coming back to “an uncorrupted strain of ancestral primitivism” (Jenkins, 77). Their work injected this idea of a pure natural form of spirituality and healing into the white American imagination, and made it sound intellectual and respectable rather than scary or superstitious. They juxtaposed Native spirituality to Christianity, which they constructed as puritan, over-intellectualized, and affected. However, their image of nature-based spirituality remained vague, and they mostly described it in contrast to Christianity rather than on its own terms; rather than describing Native beliefs, they refracted them through their own lens and used the artistic motifs or music or ceremonies for their own needs.

This is probably sounding familiar for anyone who knows about the New Age. The key move here is that white Americans interested in Indigenous spirituality took the specificity out of it and extracted beliefs about the importance of nature or the oneness of the universe, which brings us to the most direct ancestors of the New Age, which flourished during the First World War and Great Depression. For instance, Theosophy was based on the idea that all spiritual systems lead to a similar kind of enlightenment, and mix and matched from Western occult systems, Jewish Kabbala, Hinduism, Buddhism, and global Indigenous ceremonies. This system was founded by Helena P. Blavatsky, a Russian-American woman who claimed to have unique insights into human origins and the oneness of all spiritualities. She became a sensation amongst the middle class of the English-speaking world, the same kind of audience as the artists described above. She wrote that Native pictographs were actually an ancient system of writing that came from Atlantis, that the Serpent Mound of the American West was a sign of a universal religion that also included Hindu snake worship, and that there was a whole lost history in which Native Americans had been connected to the same ancient universal religion as the Norse, the writers of the Vedas, and other ancient cultures. In Spiritualism, a kind of working-class counterpart of Theosophy, mediums who claimed to be able to talk to the spirits of the deceased often claimed to have been taught by Native Americans.

Since these systems and ideas were the inspiration for so much of the New Age (a universality amongst all religions that can be perceived by the enlightened, the appeal of ancient secret knowledge, a vague reverence towards nature, and distaste of hierarchical religions), we can argue that medicine shows, turn-of-the-century artistic transcendentalist influences, and spiritual systems like Theosophy imparted New Age’s fascination with Indigenous spirituality.Ultimately it all comes back to the trope of the noble savage, the idea that Native Americans are especially undespoiled by modernity and innately spiritual."
AskHistorians,"Why did ""town drunks"" not just get cut off?",[removed]
AskHistorians,How did the first generations of Germans born after WW2 react to coming of age and realizing that their parents generation may have participated in things that were nearly universally agreed to be horrible atrocities?,"This is a very interesting and complex question. To start, I'd like to establish three main generations of interest - the war generation (those old enough to have fought in the war), their children (the Kriegskinder, born between 1930 - 1945), and their grandchildren (the Kriegsenkel, born between 1960 - 1970).

Germany was in utter ruin by war's end. The economy was in shambles, the government was either defunct or dead, food scarcity was rampant - it was a very traumatic time to have lived through, especially for a child. The Kriegskinder were subjected to the oppressive and omnipresent propaganda spewed out by the state that demanded unswerving loyalty to the Vaterland, to the Führer, and to National Socialism. What a shock it must have been during Entnazifizierung (denazification) and after when these kids were confronted with the full horror of what their parents had done after their erstwhile enemies had occupied their homeland. The Allies were very keen on the concept of collective guilt, and went to great pains to establish a moral and legal framework whereby they could prosecute Nazi war criminals. This required extensive and exhaustive documentation of all the crimes pertaining to the Holocaust and depicted the camps in gut-wrenching detail. This was totally incongruous to what the Kriegskinder had grown up believing. Broadly speaking, the Kriegskinder generation is more taciturn and reticent about revealing details of the war. Shame, guilt, anger, confusion, all combined in this horrible emotional crucible and we're still trying to figure out the deeper societal and psychological implications.

The culmination of this is that the Kriegskinder generation had to grin and bear their anger towards their parents, as their first worry was finding shelter and enough food to eat. Then the task of rebuilding the nation was at hand, and there seems to not have been a lot of gas left in the tank for psychological introspection, so to speak, so it fell to *their* children. The dust had settled, the Wirtschaftswunder saw the German economy boom and recover, and the cold war was winding to an end. The Wiedervereinigung (reunification) brought the east back into the fold, and their harsh and oppressive regime was stamped out. The wounds of war had been sewn, and now the time had come to heal and introspect. In this [article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1466138116674735) that I'll cite below, author Lina Jakob says:

*Born in the 1960s and 1970s, Kriegsenkel feel that through processes of transgenerational transmission unresolved war experiences  were passed on to them by their families and are largely responsible for  their emotional problems – from depression and anxiety disorders to  relationship break-ups and career problems.*

In conclusion, there is still a lot of research being done into the psychological impacts of the childhood trauma that the Kriegskinder were subjected to, and even more into the effects on German society in the past couple of decades through to today. I have a lot of resources like interviews pertaining to this subject as well as more articles if you're interested! I'm also more than happy to answer any follow-ups as this is a pretty tough topic to tackle.

AskHistorians,"Switzerland, Austria and Germany famously have ""hidden champions"" - small and mid-sized enterprises that are world leaders in their field but relatively obscure. Are there any goods reads on how they became so successful and history behind it?","You might be interested in *Hidden Champions of the 21st Century: Success Strategies of Unknown World Market Leaders* by Hermann Simon ([link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-98147-5)).

Simon defines a hidden champion as having 1) number one, two, or three market position globally, or number one on its own continent, 2) revenue below $4B, and 3) a low level of public awareness. The book is geared towards distilling lessons for managers and investors as you might expect given Simon's background as a consultant and business professor.

The book is mostly focused on *how* hidden champions are run rather than *why* they appear in certain geographic regions. But he does take a stab at answering your question of why so many are concentrated in German-speaking nations.

To start with it is not just Germany, but Northern Europe writ broadly. Simon writes:

>We find that there is a similar density of hidden champions in Scandinavia, The Benelux countries, and Northern Italy versus those found in the German speaking countries. By contrast, the rest of Europe has far fewer midsize market leaders of this kind. This company segment is little developed particularly in France and the Iberian peninsula.

So it's not so much that only Germany has hidden champions but that France, Spain, Portugal, and Southern Europe are missing them.

>In these countries \[those missing hidden champions\], we observe a preference for and admiration of large corporations and the so-called ""national champions”… I consider the role of the state a major distraction to the true course of hidden champions

Simon therefore explains missing champions in the rest of Europe as an outgrowth of industrial policy championing large state-sponsored or semi-public businesses that crowd out mid-size leaders.

What about the U.S., then? Certainly they are free market supporters? Well...

>In the US, we find many midsize companies with excellent competencies, who consider their home market so large that they have not seen the necessity for internationalization. This attitude... harbors serious risks. Exclusive presence in the U.S. market makes such companies vulnerable when leading international hidden champions enter this market.

So to sum it up, hidden champions are not just a German-speaking phenomenon but exist in similar concentrations across Northern Europe such as Scandinavia and the Netherlands.

The key seems to be that these nations have the right mix of free-market policy, economic development, and a skilled labor force (I haven't discussed, but Simon also mentions access to talent) to build powerful businesses. And yet, these nations are too small to fully support these businesses with a domestic market, forcing them to compete abroad. This gives those businesses closer ties to their global customers and the ability to see around corners and understand rising international threats. Simon argues that this set of internal and external forces builds mid-sized hidden champions."
AskHistorians,Why didn’t Mississippi basin have as large a population as Ganges basin in India or Yangtze in China?,"My expertise is in the Mississippi Valley rather than China or India, so my answer is heavily slanted towards this.

North America was rather dispersed in population, but *Mesoamerica* was *very* densely populated. The parts of Mesoamerica occupied by Nahua and Mayan-language speakers was the most densly populated part of the entire world in 1491. For scale, the population of what is now Mexico did not recover its pre-Columbian population until the 1970s. More Mesoamerica at least, the ""head-start idea"" does not really hold water. Had it not been for Columbian pandemics Mesoamerica might have had a population similar to that of Yangtze or Ganges. They had well-developed agricultural and economic systems that facilitated rapid population growth and a climate and geography condusive to highly-productive agricultural products (maize, squash, etc.). I do not know if your book mentioned that, but that would be a large blind spot if it did not.

The Mississippi River basin is a different question. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that humans have been building monumental architecture in the basin since the last Ice Age, over 11,000 years ago! (One mound site in Louisiana has been confirmed to be nearly 11,000 years old)* One working theory, drawing from James C. Scott, is that the Mississippi Valley was *too productive* for a huge population. Game and foragable foods were too common and too well-managed for people to make the leap into mass agriculture. That's because diverse foraging options makes it difficult for any kind of upper class to control the food supply and thus the population. The catch is that, while diverse food populations make for physically-healthier and more egalitarian social groups, these groups tend to have a rather low population growth because population is tied more directly to natural yield and, even with the complicated and effective means deployed by Mississippi Valley communities over the millennia, these yields can only get so high. We actualy start seeing explosive population growth in the MV with the Coles Creek (~700 CE) and the Mississippian/Plaquemine (~1000) periods, when the Mississippi Valley communities began transitioning into a more intensive, maize-reliant agricultural system akin to that of Mesoamerica. With this case in mind, the ""late-start"" theory you mention seems more credible. If James Scott is to be believed (and I find his arguments compelling) then the reason the MV got such a late start is because its political elites were unable to force their subjects into agricutlural labor regimes that promoted large populations until later, in part due to highly effective environmental management systems and practices maintained over thousands of years. 

If ""civilization"" is our benchmark, the MV had a headstart of thousands of years. If ""elite dominion"" is our benchmark, then we can say with certaint that the MV was late to the game. Even so, Mesoamerica complicates this theory because its maize-intensive agricultural systems are fairly recent (2500 BCE) compared to rice cultivation in the Yangtze (~6,000-7000 BCE), but still experienced comparable population growth. 

I suppose that I haven't really answered your question, but I doubt I could have given a concrete, definitive answer. In the end, I find this a very interesting question

AskHistorians,"Why do people say that Cleopatra was Greek, rather than Egyptian?","Because we tend to use ‘Greek’ and ‘Egyptian’ *in an ancient context* to refer to ethnic identity - based chiefly on language and self-appellation - rather than simply where they were born, or a modern sense of nationality that didn’t exist yet. Likewise, we consider the Greeks of Magna Graecia in Italy ‘Greeks’ - they spoke Greek, and considered themselves Hellenes.

However, it’s also completely reasonable to call Cleopatra ‘Egyptian’ in the other sense, as long as one is clear about which sense one is using. 

The Ptolemies adopted Egyptian dress and many customs, as Alexander had adopted Persian dress and customs as it suited him - in both cases especially where it gave enormous privileges and deification or near deification to the ruler. This apparently even extended to sibling marriage… But they did not apply for some citizenship of an Egyptian state - under Alexander they were conquerors there. 

And the difference between Greeks and Egyptians under the Ptolemies was still stark: the ethnically Egyptian, Egyptian-speaking and -identifying majority did undergo discrimination and exclusion from opportunities at court, and had multiple major uprisings that were put down by the more privileged Hellenic elite. 

Now the cultures syncretised more and more as time went on, and with the Roman conquest there were eventually three layers of Egyptian residents (Egyptians, other groups like Greeks but also Jews and others who were not but had come in more recently, and at the top the Romans). Now as more people mixed and the distinctions broke down (after all, Caracalla massively expanded the notion of Roman citizenship across the Empire), their identities merged. The Islamic conquest of course added yet another layer, and the main distinction came to be that between Muslims and non-Muslims, mostly Christians of mostly Egyptian but some Greek, Roman and other descent, which identities dissolved into today’s Copts, and in fact the use of ‘Copts’ to refer to a small subset of what we today call ‘Egyptians’ emphasises this, as they both have the same root word (Greek ‘Aigyptos’, Egypt). ‘Greek’ Egyptian identity today only goes back to far more recent migration, especially the Ottomans. 

But at the time of Cleopatra the distinction was still very marked, and we can’t speak of these identities in ‘nationalised’ terms: there was never one unified but specifically Greek polity, after all. America today is not really comparable to Egypt then, as neither the formation of the U.S. nor the Colonies were not simply the replacement of the head of an already existing state largely consisting of a mostly homogenous ethnic identity.

But I would quibble a little: George Washington was very much a ‘British subject’ before independence was declared, and considered himself as such. More than that, unlike others under British rule for him this was what we would now call an ethnic identity (both British and English), very much his heritage, but he had an ‘American colonial’ and ‘Virginian’ identity alongside that. But being British carried with it a sense of loyalty to the British government, which he obviously came to object to, when there was no such equivalent for being a ‘Hellene’. There is still however a residual notion of ‘British-American’, or even ‘WASP’ (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant), or just ‘Anglo-Saxon’.  Being ethnically a Hellene was perhaps closer to that, because there was no equivalent of the American Revolution for that identity to be broken. Perhaps even more closely, it is similar to how even non-religious Jews identify as such even if they were not born and raised in the polity of Judea. 

Is this all maybe a bit inconsistent? Yes. Words often are, and what matters to identity depends hugely on context, region, period, and how the groups see themselves."

AskHistorians,"In Peaky Blinders, British cavalrymen are presented as being usually upper class. Tommy seemingly resents them for this, as well as their perceived failures in battle. Is it accurate that cavalry in WW1 were made up mostly of the upper class? And was this feeling common among infantry?","The cavalry has historically been (and, to some extent, still is) the gentleman's arm. Going back to ancient or medieval armies, cavalrymen had to provide their own horses. In later eras, after the growth of national standing armies, it was common to only recruit men who could already ride - which meant that cavalry regiments were often full of rich men and country boys. All of this contributed to making the cavalry a lot more exclusive than the infantry. In the 18th and 19th centuries, when officers purchased their commissions, rank in a ""fashionable"" cavalry regiment could cost ten times as much as the same grade in an infantry one. It was not unusual for (relatively) rich young men to serve as troopers in the most exclusive regiments, waiting for the opportunity to snap up a vacant officer's job when it appeared - ""gentleman rankers"". This culture still existed in the twentieth century. Cavalry regiments preserved their exclusivity with traditions that priced ordinary men out of serving with them (e.g. the price of uniforms, or what wine you were allowed to drink in the mess). 

On the subject of failures in battle: this can be overstated, though it makes perfect sense for the characters in Peaky Blinders to have bought into the popular image of the cavalry as an obsolete and tactically irrelevant arm. The reality is that horse cavalry regiments had many successes in the Middle East and Africa but that conditions on the Western Front after 1914 meant there were few opportunities to effectively use them. There was no doubt resentment towards the cavalry, for a variety of reasons:
1) the cavalry had always styled itself as ""the arm of decision"", arguing that battles were often in the balance until a decisive charge tipped the scales. The Western Front was a campaign completely unsuited to this kind of thinking. 
2) cavalry regiments were often held in reserve (because mounted units could react quickly to changes on the battlefield) which made it appear that they didn't experience the same hardships as men in the trenches (in reality cavalry regiments often dismounted and took turns in the trenches too).
3) many unpopular generals (e.g. Hubert Gough) were cavalrymen, and it was easy to draw a line from their shortcomings to generalisations about the cavalry itself.

To answer your questions directly, the cavalry was/is definitely more exclusive than the infantry. Tommy's specific complaints are not 100% accurate but are absolutely representative of the views of a left-wing veteran (which he is) of the period."
AskHistorians,"I am a common citizen of Uruk in 2900BC, in its Golden Age. What does my house look like?","This answer will largely be based on a class from one of the foremost early Mesopotamian archaeologists, Augusta McMahon. I can't really cite specific sources for further reading since this is largely based on my lecture notes, but for more information you might try Bahrani's *Mesopotamia, Ancient Art and Architecture* which is especially accessible to non-experts in Assyriology, and, despite its age, for a more technical analysis I would recommend Robert Adams and Hans Nissen's [The Uruk Countryside: The Natural Setting of Urban Societies](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/uruk-countryside-natural-setting-urban-societies).

The first thing to address is chronology, as 2900 BCE isn't actually the peak of Uruk. According to the most commonly used timeline, Middle Chronology, 2900 BCE would be the end of the Uruk/Jemdet Nasyr period, and transitioning into the beginning stages of the Early Dynastic Period. Starting between 3100 and 3000 BCE we actually see a decline in the size and prosperity of Uruk and most Southern city-states as they lose control/contact with their 'colonies' in the North, West, and East, and so access to the valuable trade and goods which they provided. That's okay though because the 'standard' house design for Mesopotamia actually remains fairly consistent from the beginning of the Uruk period through the Akkadian period, and arguably even further into the Ur III period or after. For that reason my description will largely be of this ideal model for the house which most excavated homes mimicked to one extent or another, and isn't necessarily grounded in a particular century (or city for that matter since the Uruk period had spread Uruk material culture and forms throughout most of Mesopotamia).

The foundation of the 'standard' Mesopotamian house in this early period was the tripartite design. This means that there was a large central room or courtyard which served as the center of the home, and usually was one of the first rooms that a person entered in order to gain access to all other rooms. Surrounding this central courtyard would be several smaller rooms in a somewhat haphazard layout according to a families individual needs. An important concept in archaeological study of these houses is the 'degrees of privacy,' or essentially how many rooms you had to walk through in order to access a particular room. This supposedly created a separation between public-facing and private rooms within the home. A guest might see the courtyard and one or two degrees of privacy deep into a home, but it's not often they would see further as these would be private bedrooms, storage rooms, etc. The number of rooms varies based on wealth, utilization of rooms (say needing a workshop to produce crafts), and family size, though I've personally seen examples with as few as 8 rooms, and as many as 20+. Keep in mind though that we don't know the use or purpose of all of these rooms, and we're having to count relatively small rooms which likely served as our equivalent of a closet or pantry. At this time almost all houses appear to have been made of mudbrick, with no tauf or stone houses that I'm aware of. In the Uruk period the ""Reimchen"" brick dominated, a small square brick not much larger than our modern bricks that fit together tightly, with a seemingly standardized size which indicates that perhaps they were building standardized room sizes or even whole houses. In the Early Dynastic period we see a transition to the plano-convex brick which was larger and had flat bottoms and sides, with a slightly curved top, implying that they were made by packing mud and straw into a mold. These bricks didn't fit nearly as tightly together and there is a much more ad hoc way of placing them, with lots of 'plaster' in between to fill in the gaps.

Moving onto to some of the features of these houses. Hallways weren't really a thing, and it appears that every room attaches directly to other rooms, or else the outside. It's also very common in urban settings for neighbors to build their houses directly next to each other, sharing walls. This can create the illusion of a single gigantic building, but we are able to isolate individual houses through looking at doorways and where one group of rooms ends and another begins. It doesn't appear uncommon for a house to have a wood roof, expensive considering the difficulty of acquiring decent timber in Mesopotamia, though it can be difficult to judge which houses had wood roofs or not because the wood doesn't tend to preserve in the archaeological record. The presence or nature of windows is also hard to judge since we often only have the footprint of a house, or else a couple feet or less of standing wall. Most houses have 'ovens' attached to them on the outside which would have been used for heating when necessary as well as cooking or any other needs for a fire. Occasionally these ovens are found inside the house as well, presumably in a well ventilated room or a courtyard with no roof. While many homes, especially earlier ones, show signs of household craft production, in later periods we see an increase in administrative workshops attached to palaces and temples, which corresponds to a decrease in the presence of home workshops.

As for furniture and home decoration, it largely seems to have been made of perishable materials as there is little surviving in the archaeological record. This rules out stone beds and the like, and we would probably see indications of mud or tauf furniture as well so we can also rule those out. As mentioned earlier wood was extremely to difficult to acquire as it required expeditions to the Lebanese or Zagaros mountains in order to fell trees and transport them back to the cities. What Mesopotamians had plenty of though was reed and fiber, and we already know they used it in highly advanced and innovative ways. Likely things such as beds and sofas would be made of one or the other, or some combination of the two, and if possible covered in a textile such as wool or linen to make more comfortable. As to lighting I can't really comment, like I said we can't be certain of the situation with windows, and afiak we don't see a lot of lanterns or candle stands in the common household assemblage. Obviously archaeology isn't perfect and it's very possible they were using perishable materials in order to hold candles or flames which they used for writing.

That's about all I have for concrete knowledge about houses in the early history of Mesopotamia. Since you mentioned you're interested in the urban design I'll add a few things you might find interesting. The model of the house was extremely important to Mesopotamian ideology. They perceived most aspects of their society from the local administration, religious institutions, all the to businesses and 'firms' as ""scalable households"" modeled off the private household both literally and metaphorically. To read more about this I would recommend Steven Garfinkle's [""Family Firms in the Ur III Period.""](https://www.academia.edu/62582348/Family_Firms_in_the_Ur_III_Period) In Sumerian the word for palace was E^(2).GAL which literally translates to ""Big/Great house."" Both temple and palace architecture was based on a scaled up version of the tripartite design, with a large central courtyard and smaller surrounding rooms with degrees of privacy. During the Uruk expansion of the Uruk period, when Southern Mesopotamia was establishing its 'colonies' throughout the region, they would always bring along their 'standard' house design with them. ""True colonies"" built on virgin soil such as Habuba Kabira had planned layouts and ensured plenty of room for each house to be able to achieve the standard design. ""Enclaves"" within existing settlements such as Hacinebi Tepe are identified because of the existence of Southern style houses in a particular section of the city. At urbanizing northern sites such as Tell Hamouker, which had their own architectural tradition, we see the adoption of southern style houses after the arrival of Southerners (though there is evidence of conflict and it's very likely that the Southerners conquered T. Hamouker and rebuilt it with their own plans). And lastly, in already densely occupied Southern style sites such as Kafajah we see in later periods a rebuilding of the domestic sections of the city which had been cramped before, in order to give more space for individual houses in the standard design.

I hope that answered your questions and I apologize I couldn't talk more about some of the specifics such as lighting or furniture. Let me know if I can clarify anything or if you have any further questions!"
AskHistorians,[META] Academic history is in trouble but the public demand for history content is enormous. What’s going on?,"There is a vast disconnect between what people want for entertainment purposes and what they want for educational purposes. If students were signing up in droves to be history majors, there would be more academic history jobs. This isn't the only factor, but it's a big one — lots of universities work on the model where the funding for a given department or unit is based on student enrollment. History departments get cuts when demand is low. 

Why are demands low? Because students and their parents rightly or wrongly think that a history major makes for a poor career choice, at a time when college tuitions are extremely high and many students end up with substantial debt as a result of a college education. This creates pressures to choose majors that are considered better ""bets"" from the position of economic security. 

If college was affordable and people had the impression that a history degree was a good economic choice, would they be more likely to sign up? I suspect so. I was a history major in part because I didn't feel strong financial pressures in my choice of major, but this was because I went to a state school in a different age and was not going to graduate with any debt. I did not feel acutely worried about my future economic status. That is definitely _not_ how my students feel; they are, almost to a one, motivated in part by economic anxieties. I am not blaming them for this; they are a post-2008 generation, they can see the writing on the wall.

One could imagining trying to address this issue from several different directions, to be sure. And there are other complexities about the academic job market that come into play, to be sure."

Just as interesting is the Enterprise proper, though.

The most recent Enterprise monikers - with the obvious exception of the new *Ford* class carrier - are indisputably from Star Trek fans.  Speaking of them, the impression of a link between Star Trek and the age of sail Enterprises is probably even more recent.  It likely comes from Star Trek: Enterprise's *In A Mirror Darkly*, where during the opening sequence there's a ""HMS Enterprize"" graphic with a silhouetted age of sail ship followed by a clip from the 1945 film *The Spanish Main* of an 18th century warship firing a cannon.  My own recollection was wrong as well; I thought HMS Enterprize was etched on the stern, but it wasn't, and I suspect that if I misremembered that there's a good chance many other fans may have been under the impression that Roddenberry got the name after considering a long line of Enterprises.

We do have stronger evidence against this since so much has been written on *Star Trek*.  In the March 1964 pitch to Desilu, the original ship was not the *Enterprise* but the *Yorktown*.  From Cushman:

>""The vessel used to transport us into the dramatic stories, with the registry of “United Space Ship,” was the Yorktown, later to be re-christened Enterprise. It was described as 190,000 gross tons, carrying a crew of 203 and able to travel beyond the speed of light, thanks to its “space-warp” drive. The mission of the U.S.S. Yorktown was set for five years.""

Roddenberry's pitch doesn't go great, but it's an interesting enough idea that the studio funds it, and at some point in July as the pilot starts to be written the ship gets renamed to Enterprise. Later, Roddenberry is quite open about his inspiration.  From Gross & Altman:

>""With the name Enterprise, I’d been an army bomber pilot in World War II. I’d been fascinated by the navy and particularly fascinated by the story of the Enterprise in World War II, which at Midway really turned the tide in the whole war in our favor. I’d always been proud of that ship and wanted to use the name.""

This is reasonable considering how much Midway captured the public imagination, but what's a little peculiar about this explanation is that the [Yorktown was right there too, at least until I-168 got in the way](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dvu77s/midway_megathread_the_battle_of_midway_and/).  While Yorktown has been used multiple times in the franchise afterwards (there's plenty of fan literature about the name), it doesn't look like Roddenberry ever got asked about that particular name change. The CV-6 *Enterprise* did make it through the entire war and was a superstar because of it, but perhaps either he or the studio or someone else pointed out that the name was also less identified with the American Revolution (unless you were very familiar with it) and/or didn't get sunk.  We'll likely never know.

When we take a look prior to CV-6, though, the *Enterprise* name was, well, [not all that distinguished](https://web.archive.org/web/20130301095522/http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/enterprise/Documents/Enterprise/the_legend.html). Interestingly, even the book on the CV-6 and CVN-65 (Stafford's *The Big E*) skips the history of its earlier versions. It is a name that periodically got recycled when appropriate non-capital ships were available; the best that can be said about the predecessors is that one was part of the tiny handful of American ships that fought an actual duel with the British in the War of 1812, versus the majority of the fleet which was bottled up in port.  (The notable exception during this was the Essex running amok in the Pacific, likely why it became the name of a class of carriers.)

This is not entirely its fault, since there's a nice overview of how the US Navy decided to name its ships [here](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/naming-navy-ships-in-world-war-ii) and the Secretary of the Navy was required to name capital ships after states and locations.  The names for WW2 era aircraft carriers were a little freer, bouncing back and forth between a few concepts, including the American Revolution.

Why Enterprise in particular was plucked from relative obscurity to an aircraft carrier is far more fun, though.  It has to do with, of all people, Benedict Arnold.

So in May of 1775 Colonel Arnold surprises the British by attacking and capturing the lightly defended Fort Ticonderoga at the south end of Lake Champlain, which borders New York, Vermont, and conveniently for the Americans also goes up most of the way towards Montreal.  There's a long story suited to a top level question behind the mess of that campaign - he and Ethan Allen fought both contemporaneously and in the historiography - but the relevant part here is that after taking Ticonderoga on May 10th, the men he sends by water to the more northern fort at Crown Point report back that they can't get near it because of the HMS *George*, which can blow away anything the Americans put on the water.

So Arnold, who may have originally intended only to seize and hold the forts and send their cannon back down to Cambridge - Henry Knox shows up a few weeks later to do so - gets a second group to capture the even more lightly defended Fort Amherst at Crown Point by land, and then plots out what to do about the *George* since he realizes neither of the forts he's taken are anywhere close to secure while it's on the water.  Arnold gets a report that the only thing keeping the *George* from retaliating is that it's waiting for a favorable wind to come south from St. Jean.

He sends for a small but fast schooner, the *Katherine*, which arrives from the south.  The Americans put 10 guns on her along with provisions, rename her *Liberty* and take her 150 or so miles north along with a couple smaller boats.  A scout reports the *George* is indeed docked at St. Jean, another 30 miles up, and he informs Arnold that not only do the British already know about the loss of their forts but there are reports of a whole bunch of redcoats on the march to reinforce St. Jean who are then planning on sailing down to crush the rebels.  

Arnold doesn't wait.  On May 19th, his men sail and row (the wind still isn't favorable) most of the remaining distance to St. Jean, hide the boats in a creek about a mile and a half from their target, find the British aren't aware of them yet, and then disembark a mere 100 yards away from the barracks.  At 0600 he personally leads a charge on the barracks and the docked *George*, and given his 3-1 advantage in manpower, bloodlessly captures both the fort and the ship.  The prisoners tell him that reinforcements are expected later that day - the commander is off getting them in Montreal, and there are supposedly 40 more coming momentarily from a post 12 miles away - so in a two hour period his men strip the fort of everything he can pack into his little fleet and then hightail it south.  Even the never-humble Arnold is openly stunned at how genuinely lucky he's gotten.

He then renames the *George*; it is now the *Enterprise*, and becomes the temporary flagship of Arnold's fleet.  Why this is historically significant is summed up by Randall:

>""With thirty-five men in two open boats, the man who had conceived and helped to lead the first American offensive by invading another sovereign province only a week later now led the first naval attack in American history. It was also the first American invasion of a foreign country and an act which committed the Continental Congress to extend the revolution to Canada.""

After that, what's a little amusing given all the legend surrounding the name is that the war record of even that *Enterprise* isn't particularly noteworthy on its own.  It sails north a few times but mostly just serves as a deterrent until it gets replaced by bigger and badder during the course of the frenzied Champlain ship building race of the next year.  It comes along with Arnold's new flagship, the 12 gun *Royal Savage*, for the first big battle on the Lake in October 1776 at Valcour Island, where it mostly serves as bait while the bigger ships lay in wait in a relatively successful ambush that's a tactical loss but strategic victory.  To hint at how far it has fallen, though, when *Royal Savage* is grounded and later burned, Arnold moves his flag to the *Congress* instead and the *Enterprise* serves as an ad hoc hospital ship; there are several references to some terrible wounds and amputations performed on it.  It participates in a few scouting missions up north with larger ships, but nothing significant.  While the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 is a success, the preceding siege of Ticonderoga where *Enterprise* runs supplies sees it encounter the main British Fleet; it gets deliberately run aground and burned to prevent its capture.

I've gone through a bunch of material to try and glean if Arnold ever explained precisely why he immediately chose that particular name, and as far as I can tell he didn't.  My suspicion is that it was a rather direct taunt to the British on how they came by their first HMS Enterprise some 70 years earlier.

It too had been a prize capture - of the Royal Navy from the French.

AskHistorians,"When people look back at Middle-Ages they are quick to identify with the peasants, the commoners and their plight, whereas when looking back on Classical Greece and Rome, they identify more easily with the citizen class and the philosophers. Why the difference and when did it started?",[removed]
AskHistorians,How Did Nanking Reach Such Levels Of Brutality?,"The answer above provides a fantastic overview of a lot of the main causal historical factors that are typically pointed to. I especially appreciate the comparison to Lebensraum which I think is very apt for showing how the Japanese envisioned the Chinese. 

I want to point out some more recent scholarship that, though tangential, have contributed greatly to our psychological/philosophical understanding of atrocity. 

First, I just want to say that answering these big picture questions such as how do we pathologize atrocity is incredibly difficult. 

There’s a recent book by Sarah Kovner called Prisoners of the Empire which is the best historical monograph to date that has attempted to pathologize POW brutality in Japanese prisoner camps. And what she found is that the Japanese government, unlike the Nazis, did NOT have a codified plan for mass genocide. 

Rather, the brutality was highly contingent on the specific camp and camp commander and was often due to negligence and inability for field commanders to restrain their troops on the ground. In fact, she found that there was less brutality in the camps that had more oversight from Tokyo, which became increasingly hard through out the war after the Japanese Navy was obliterated in 1943. 

Moreover, the Japanese were infamous for being incredibly violent to their own troops, and so the violence would trickle down the command chain with the lowest rungs taking their anger out on POWs. Additionally, The Japanese army practiced a culture of heavily decentralized command, in which individual field commanders down to the company level were given a lot of autonomy to manage (or not) their own troops. This all created a culture where there was very little accountability for on the ground action. 

While this book discusses brutality against POWs mainly, I think it’s productive in illuminating how Japanese brutality was not a national codified program in the same way that the Holocaust was, but was more a series of pogroms overseen at very granular, local levels. 

A second source I want to highlight is an article called The Psychology of Atrocity by John Dorris and Dominic Murphy which discusses how the brutalization and stressors of front line combat are so high that it simply dampens any moral feeling and moral agency. 

This is not historical scholarship per say but it does pull from soldiers complicit in the My Lai massacre and is important for understanding the psychology that makes atrocity possible. Of course this is not to absolve culprits of blame, but to understand how brutality comes naturally during war, with Nanjing being an extreme and large scale case of that. We need to remmeber for instance that Japan and China were at war unofficially since 1931, and so these troops had been on the front for a while by the time 1937 swung around. 

I know these don’t get at the heart of your question which is what makes this exigent compared to other atrocities. However, I would also push back against this notion that Japanese atrocity was a difference of kind, rather than simply scale. A lot of our understanding of imperial Japan is clouded in racism, which is not to absolve them but is to say that it’s important to question how any attempt to relativize atrocity is going to be clouded by these bias. That has been the purpose of bringing up these two sources which have in some ways attempted to pathologize atrocity without taking for granted cultural biases. 

Lastly, another point that I have discussed with scholars in the field is that the Sino-Japanese War was absolute in the sense that the Japanese had no clear political goal. It was very much an ethnic war in the sense that brutality and the eradication of the other race became an end in itself. Early into the war the Japanese had already defeated most Chinese field armies and secured the 5 main industrial zones of China—Manchuria (often compared to the German ruhr)—as early as 1931. They invaded for land and resources, and by 1937, had already secured most of China’s economic potential. 

However, the war continued which is testament to the lack of a political goal on either side. Clausewitz’s famous dictum, war as a continuation of politics, was also a prescription about how to avoid “absolute” war. The Sino-Japanese war is a great and harrowing example of what happens when war is fought without a clear political goal, and the violence becomes an end in itself, rather than as a means to an end. Had there been a political end in sight and stricter control over the rank-and-file, Tokyo would’ve realised that atrocity is counter intuitive to any sort of peace settlement. But it was the absence of that civilian control and political foresight, in tandem with the many other factors discussed, that contributed to Nan Jing."
AskHistorians,Do cities still get buried over time?,"Short answer: yep!

There is *a lot* that can be said about this, because your question encompasses not only archaeological practices but also modern construction techniques and environmental processes. I cannot speak to the latter two but can to the former (archaeological practice), and I can make some educated extrapolations about some of the latter, but my hope is that others will weigh in and expand this.

I think the easiest way to get right to the heart of your question is to say that we do still build on top of older activity often, but not always, and if we do so, it loosely depends upon 2 factors: 1) the occupational history of the area and the local geology, and 2) the complexity of the project about to be built.

So, first: occupational history and local geology. What I mean by this is if you want to build something, you have to first determine what's under the plot you're going to turn into your building site. Because laws and regulations vary widely among the various places worldwide, I won't tie this answer to any particular place (also because I'm an academic archaeologist and I don't profess to have any expertise with the intersection of law and archaeology as it relates to construction projects), so I'll speak generally. If you have an open lot, then you first want to determine if anything is beneath your building location - are there traces of a building's foundation? [A sea port](https://www.alexandriava.gov/archaeology/archaeology-at-robinson-terminal-south)? A burial ground? Again, laws and regulations will indicate what you have to survey (in some places you are required to have qualified archaeological teams come in to survey/remote sense/excavate and deal with any sites that may be found on your property; in some places where private property is more prized than cultural heritage, there are fewer regulations), but this is also where local geology is going to come in. How far down can you dig into the ground before you hit bedrock? And what kind of bedrock is it? Because this will determine some aspect of how you proceed. If your lot has a deep enough layer of soil, which has nothing perceptible in it that would undermine the structural integrity of what you propose to build (i.e. any cavities - old tunnels/drains, caves, etc), then you would likely simply go ahead with your construction - dig the foundation you need, and then create the sub- and super-structure you plan to build. If you need to involve bedrock - maybe it is quite shallow where you are, or you are building something so tall and heavy (think skyscrapers) that you have to create a deep sounding in order to make that structure sound - then you're likely stripping everything out, down to said bedrock, before drilling in. This would, as you presume, remove any earlier activity in that immediate area. 

This, however, ties in to my point #2 - it depends on what you're building. Shallow structures like light/one-story buildings, parking lots, etc - or things that have few interface points with the earth - like a new line of telephone poles, solar panels, etc - are less likely to need to interfere with what might be *deeply* below ground. Contrast this with building a 20+-story high rise, which needs an extremely deep sounding and clearance for the entire footing of the building, and you can see how these different projects will have entirely different implications for any potential archaeological remains within their proposed building plots.

Another thing to keep in mind is where the modern ground level is. This seems obvious, but we don't just dig down to bedrock and build from there as standard practice; if you're putting in a new building, you are constructing it conscious of the elevation of modern streets, sidewalks, etc. So, if I'm building in Rome today, I want the entrance to my building to be level to where modern Rome is - but modern Rome is several meters above any ancient remains. (This was even true in antiquity - the ground level of Augustus' day was not the ground level for his successors even ca. 100 years later, and going even later than this, Augustus' Ara Pacis/Altar of Peace was [entirely underground as early as the 5th c AD](https://www.reed.edu/ara-pacis/chronology.php#d2nd).) The rising ground level is due to myriad factors, some of which are natural - sediment buildup from the Tiber River, for example - and some of which are man-made, including the accumulation of the building activity of millennia and also purposeful raising of the ground level in places (Hadrian, for example, raised the ground level of the Campus Martius by about 1.8 meters in AD 123, as demonstrated by [retaining walls he built to protect the Ara Pacis](https://www.reed.edu/ara-pacis/chronology.php#d2nd)). So, if you want to build a new building, some/all of the factors I've just mentioned will impact how much material needs to be removed before that new building can be constructed. But, again, I'm speaking exceptionally generally here and not with any specific connection to modern construction in Rome - though, if you are curious, one good way to learn more about what engineers, architects, etc are actually dealing with in building in modern-day Rome is to keep your eye on the creation of the new [Linea C for Rome's metro](https://metrocspa.it/en/the-work/), which has been dealing with the intersection of modern and ancient Rome since work began in 2006.

This answer has so far only dealt with very specific areas, though, and assumes that people are living in one area now, where people lived in the past, and will continue to live in the future. But if we broaden our perspective, temporally, we can also see that the population centers of today are not necessarily those of yesterday and tomorrow. Settlements are abandoned all the time for various reasons, but often those reasons are environmental - whatever caused people to want to live in an area originally is subject to change, and the location is no longer desirable. As an example I'll cite the Greek, and later Roman, city of [Poseidonia/Paestum](https://www.sitiarcheologiciditalia.it/en/paestum/) in southern Italy - founded ca. 600 BC by Greek colonists, ostensibly to facilitate trade with the local populations and to take advantage of natural resources unobtainable in Greece^(1) and other areas. The city thrived until the Romans built a superhighway (the southern extension of the via Appia, carried out in the early 3rd c. BC) which bypassed the then-named Paestum and damaged its economic standing; it carried on for another couple of centuries until the groundwater situation changed so drastically that the city center became swampy and unhygienic, and forced the locals to move elsewhere. So, essentially, the archaeological site there preserves what was once a thriving city which was slowly abandoned and never built over. Another example of a changing coastline dramatically altering a Roman city is Baiae, a site which was popular with the Roman elite from ca. 100 BC to AD 500. [The phenomenon of bradyseism](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2030/), which is essentially the vertical movement of the ground in relation to volcanological changes below the surface, eventually submerged much of this resort town; what was ground level in the Roman period is now ca. 10m below the waterline, in places. So, a settlement in use for hundreds of years - in existence for longer than modern New York City, in fact! - is now fully underwater. With climate change picking up speed, we will have many, many more stories of a similar nature, particularly for coastal properties - these will either be submerged, the groundwater will rise so much that living there will no longer be sustainable, or the areas may simply become too dangerous from flooding, storms, etc - which will leave a lot of localities which are currently settled as future abandoned areas. 

When considering this kind of question, it's important to know that humans have always been on the move - our settlements are rarely permanent, even if they are very long-lasting in places - and the earth is constantly shifting as well. Whether we are purposely creating new land that once didn't exist (such as in the case of [Boston](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/Boston-landfill-maps-history)) or natural processes create it for us (like the coastline of the Bay of Naples extending 1km outward after the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius because of the sheer amount of debris spewed from the volcano) or we are ceding land to natural processes like sea-level rise, our habitations will always be moving, meaning we will be leaving traces of our lives behind and reclaiming land elsewhere. All of these will create entirely new situations for future builders to encounter traces of us and of our pasts.

AskHistorians,"In the early years of the United States, the US Marshals were the Federal law enforcement service. Why was a new agency (FBI) created to take over their role, with the Marshals relegated to mostly court order enforcement and escort, rather than continue using them as the general Federal LEO service?","Adapted from a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sg9ppb/getting_to_the_border_is_a_common_trope_of/huw9vot/) of previous [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u5aaf9/how_and_why_did_the_bureau_of_investigations_form/i5dusjc/) on the topic:

The first part of the answer is simple as the Marshals weren't relegated at all; what you describe was the main portion of their job from the Early Republic onward.

Why was this?  The position was a patronage one, and up until the end of the 19th century one of the more surprising things about most patronage positions was that they were paid on a percentage of revenue obtained.  So if you were a postmaster (by far the most common patronage position), you'd get a cut of every stamp sold and letter delivered.  If you were a lawyer presenting a Civil War disability claim, you'd take home a hefty sum every time you filed on someone's behalf.  And if you were a US Marshal, you'd get paid some for arresting and extraditing, but your real money maker was in serving paper.

As such, investigating was something they had neither financial interest in pursuing nor any particular expertise in, and this began to be a significant problem during the late 1800s given the sheer magnitude of fraud taking place.  Also, it's worth pointing out (credit to the removed comment for reminding me) that by the Civil War marshals were generally seen more as functionaries of the judicial rather than executive branch despite their appointments coming from the latter; an example of this can be seen in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tfhsse/the_supreme_court_ruled_that_native_american/i0zqrim/) about Roger Taney's orders to 'his' marshal from the bench in *Ex Parte Merryman*.

So there is essentially only one Federal agency that has any real investigatory experience during that time period, and that's the Secret Service - except when it does so, it is acting without any law providing them that authority.  For that matter, even their post-McKinley role in protecting the President is assumed rather than mandated; for something like a decade, Congress essentially allows them to do so with what passes as a wink and a nudge while being aware they need to pass legislation eventually.

Unlike Presidential protection, though, the investigatory role is controversial and then becomes vehemently opposed by Congress, with one of the genuinely nasty Executive-Legislative fights in American history over it taking place under Teddy Roosevelt.  

So at the time - and indeed pretty much since the adoption of the Homestead Act - there was a massive industry funneling nominal purchasers to consolidators like mine operators who would pay people (often over and over, given lax record keeping requirements - Union veterans were particularly sought after since they didn't have a 5 year waiting requirement to gain title) to grab chunks of land and mineral rights.  This happened all over the place, but the two most applicable to the formation of the Bureau of Investigation were in Oregon and Colorado.

The Oregon scandals were a long series of fraud, with a couple of Congressmen (Binger Hermann most notably) and Senator John Mitchell assisting it over a couple of decades. Mitchell was only one of 12 sitting senators ever to be criminally indicted and only one of 5 convicted; he got six months in prison and died there from an infection after having a tooth removed, which struck many of his friends in Congress as patently unjust punishment - hence one of the reasons for the nasty political fight.

But the 1907 event in Hesperus, Colorado was far worse.  It involved the lead Secret Service agent in the region, Joe Walker - who'd accomplished something like 1400 indictments from land fraud over his career, which gives an idea of just how common this was - along with another agent, Thomas Callaghan, and a couple of government contractors who were working as investigators for the Interior Department, John Chapson and Tom Harper.

They went to a homestead claim to investigate a report that it had actually been made on behalf of the Porter Fuel Company, a large coal miner in the region, hitched their horses in a place ominously referred to by locals as ""Dead Man's Gulch"", found the shaft and immediately realized that given it was reinforced it was an air shaft rather than a well, left Walker above considering he was significantly older than the 3 others and in no shape to rappel down it, went down, explored a bit to confirm it was a mine, tried to come back up, and discovered it'd been sealed off with railroad ties and dirt.

Harper excavated enough to have part of the roof cave in on him, prompting a fall that broke a few ribs with only the logs reinforcing the shaft slowing him enough so that it wasn't fatal, went back up to continue digging, made a hole big enough to exit and tie off a rope they'd brought down, and the other two followed him to the surface.

A short distance away lay the body of Walker, who'd been blasted in the back at very close range with a shotgun (he had at least 12 pellet holes in his back); his revolver was still holstered. They split up to try to better the odds that one would survive to summon help; Chapson stayed behind with the revolver to guard the body, Harper went to a nearby farmhouse he knew had a telephone, and Callaghan went back to town to get the sheriff.

On the way there, he ran into two men on a buggy, one a miner, the other holding a shotgun and identifying himself as Joseph Vanderweide, both the superintendent of Porter Fuel and the nominal owner of the homestead. They told Callaghan they were out with a shotgun on Sunday 'hunting rabbits' (which you don't do with a shotgun if you want to use their meat later); Callaghan arrested them, ran into the sheriff along the way (there had been an 'anonymous tip' of a shooting), and they were brought to the Durango jail.

Vanderweide eventually confessed, but claimed self defense, which was extraordinarily dubious given his victim was shot in the back and that Walker's revolver was untouched. The trial, conducted in state court with a judge and jury of locals opposed to government restriction on land use (for instance, the judge had reduced the 1400 indictments of the grand jury down to one, murder), was a farce and both men were acquitted. The only value of it was that in the investigation, the full plan was revealed: they were going to drop dynamite down the shaft along with Walker's body and claim a gas pocket had exploded, conveniently eliminating any evidence of the murder of all four.

The case made it all the way up to the Supreme Court when the two were indicted on a separate count of conspiracy to commit murder, but the justices ruled the new charge was essentially double jeopardy and the two walked away free. Walker is now generally regarded as the first Secret Service agent murdered in the line of duty.

While the lack of punishment led to outrage in the press, on the other hand Congress was not particularly happy that the Secret Service had not only blown past its statutory authority but was investigating multiple members of it for land fraud.  To give you an idea of how upset Congress was, it took the extraordinary step of expunging a message from the President on the subject from its records - the first time that had been done since the Polk administration during the Mexican American War.

With Congress not willing to allow any sort of formal consolidated federal investigative branch, Roosevelt stealthily created what became the Bureau of Investigations in the summer of 1908 with an order issued by his Attorney General and the transfer of 9 Secret Service agents to become the core of a group of 30 investigators who report directly to one of the AG's aides.  (Importantly, Congress doesn't find out about this action until the fall when it's essentially a fait accompli.) Their powers and the amount of personnel employed expanded greatly with World War I, largely by default as there was no other agency - including the Marshal Service - capable of the massive amount of record keeping involved in investigating a significant amount of both aliens and citizens.

Finally, keep in mind that the other problem here was very little federal criminal law existed for the nascent Bureau to enforce; Congress had enacted almost none of the legislation we take for granted today and what there was dealt mostly with fraud.  In fact, the first modern bit of that type of legislation was the Mann Act in 1910; for a couple of decades it was about the only thing on the books that the Bureau could enforce for violent crime that crossed state borders.  Up until the 1930s the Bureau's arrest powers were often unused for the most part; it left almost all criminal cases to local and state police because there really wasn't all that much they could do on the federal level.  For that matter, once they finally gained authority, the lawyers and accountants Hoover had hired as agents in the 1920s initially proved a terrible match for the gangland warfare the FBI got thrown into in the 1930s; very few carried firearms up until that point (doing so was urged by FDR's attorney general Homer Cummings rather than Hoover himself), and some had never even fired a weapon before they were tossed into the battles that created the modern image of the agency.

Teddy Roosevelt talks about the Colorado case a little in his autobiography and it's covered a bit in some of the FBI histories, but the best narration of the story and a lot of the context I discuss comes from *The Birth of the FBI* by Willard Oliver; it's a fascinating read especially if you're curious about the history of law enforcement.  I also recommend Beverly Gage's brand new biography released a few days ago on Hoover, *G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century*; it's likely to be the reference biography on him going forward."
AskHistorians,"How did Rhodesia, now known as Zimbabwe, decide who could vote and who couldn't? I tried to watch a couple of videos where their prime minister Ian Smith tried to explain the system but it's highly confusing because he said it wasn't racial. Was it based on your ethnicity, your income, etc.?","Smith was, in short, lying.

The issue of voting rights in Rhodesia during the Ian Smith era was heavily influenced by the White minority's desire to entrench their political power in the country, and I would argue in particular that the presentation in the video was the product of an indepedent state that aimed to gain international legitimacy by minimising the appearance of their own racism where possible.

The system was designed to exclude Black citizens from meaningful participation in the political process by implementing a ""Qualified Franchise,"" which limited voting to those who met certain qualifications. 

To qualify to vote in Rhodesia during the Ian Smith era, a person had to meet one of the following qualifications:

Education: The minimum educational requirement to vote was set at the equivalent of four years of primary school education, which was higher than the average level of education for Black citizens at the time.

Property Ownership: A person had to own or occupy property that had a taxable value of at least £75 per year. This was a significant sum of money at the time, and it effectively excluded most Black citizens from the voting process.

Income: A person had to have a minimum income of £300 per year, or the equivalent. This was also a significant sum of money at the time, and it effectively excluded most Black citizens from the voting process.

Effective Black Exclusion:
The qualifications combine in a way that preserved the priviledge of Whites and excluded Blacks. For example, the educational requirement was intentionally set at a level that was higher than what the average Black citizen had access to. This was due to the lack of resources allocated to Black education, which made it more difficult for them to meet the educational requirement for voting.

Similarly, the property ownership and income requirements were set at levels that were beyond the means of most Blacks. Blacks were excluded from many economic opportunities, including property ownership, due to the policies and practices of the White minority government. For instance, the government made it difficult for Black Africans to access loans and other forms of credit, which in turn made it more challenging for them to acquire property or achieve the minimum income required to vote.

Moreover, the government did not allocate resources to develop the infrastructure necessary to provide economic opportunities, education, and healthcare services to the black population. Instead, black Africans were forced to live in designated areas that were often poor and underdeveloped, known as ""homelands."" The lack of access to resources and economic opportunities within these areas made it difficult for black Africans to achieve the requirements needed to gain the right to vote.

Combined Effect:
The educational, property ownership, and income requirements were structured in a way that made it difficult for Blacks to achieve them due to the policies and practices of the White minority government. The system ultimately perpetuated White minority rule and suppressed the majority black population from meaningfully participating in the political process.

Example:
So, let's say that one is a Black citizen who has been born in or moved to a homeland. Housing prices are depressed when compared to White areas; as noted above, the areas were almost invariably poorer and less desirable to live in, and the Black community had been denied access to credit facilities that could have created a more vibrant market for housing in those areas. You would have been excluded de facto from many higher paid jobs, and so would your peers. There's not the opportunity for a economy to develop where you earn enough to hit the income requirement, and the property values were accordingly low.

The educational requirement would also have required the Rhodesian government to increase educational provision for Black citizens, which would, I would suggest, have been against their percieved interests as a White dominated body. Your lack of education would also have been used as a reason to deny you the jobs (and salaries) that would have enabled you to vote based on the income or property requirements.

It's not that literally nobody Black got to vote, but it is the case that almost nobody Black got to vote. It's very clearly a racially biased system designed to exclude.

As Ian Smith himself put it, ""It was clear to us throughout the talks that the British were obsessed with the question of African majority rule. There will be no majority rule in my lifetime - or in my children's."" (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1569986/Ian-Smith.html)

This is striking in a country that was almost entirely Black in population. As noted at the start, Smith was obsucating his own lie."
AskHistorians,Were long poles with hooked ends really ever used to pull people off stage if they were performing badly?,"There are two theories about where applying
the hook to bad acts originated. Both involve
the Miner's Bowery, a theater hall in New York that
opened in 1878. Entry 15 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, or
70 cents depending on which seats you wanted to
get; beer was free-flowing, and as was typical 
for such theaters, audience  participation was the norm. Jeering and cheering 
were expected.

One theory of the hook (via historians Laurie Jr. 
and Green) is that the founder, Harry C. Miner, introduced
the hook; a more vivid story, via the historian 
Bernard Sobel, is that the son of H. C. Miner -- Tom Miner
-- introduced the hook himself instead, during a performance
of October of 1903.

This was during an ""amateur"" night, where a
sequence of amateurs would perform for prize money.
Five dollars and loose change thrown on the stage.
Performers genuinely hoped not just for the humble
prize money but a chance to be ""discovered""; one
such person, [Eddie Cantor](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0134662/),
went on to a successful career including in movies;
you can [watch a video of him here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9VkR95f2tA)
doing a vaudeville routine circa 1923 to get roughly the idea.

Audience members could demand longer performances from people they liked; the Scottish comedian Harry Lauder, intending a 20-minute performance as part of a sequence of acts, was met with such applause and demand from the audience (""it stormed for two minutes to an empty stage"") that he ended up extending nearly an extra hour.

Of course, not everyone was a talent. Returning to 1903,
a particularly unfortunate nameless tenor was starting
to get continuously booed by the rowdy audience. Mr. Miner had his property
manager, Charles Guthinger, attach a long pole to a
cane discarded from the previous act and
allegedly had the performer dragged away by the neck (not
actually, more on that in a moment). This
was popular enough that at the next
(also painful) performance, someone shouted ""get
the hook"" and it became a regular device.

It was probably not by the neck; the cane that
they would have had at hand would not have fit around
someone's neck, but more likely went under the collar
instead. The ""shepherd's hook"" style hook large enough
for necks didn't get introduced until later.

Cantor, who performed under threat of hook, claimed
he developed his movement style (which you can see in the video) as a way to avoid
getting snagged; this was likely somewhat tongue in
cheek, as it was easy to tell from audience reaction
whether or not one was at risk.

This seemed to be mainly a Bowery-specific schtick; where cartoons enter the picture is that they were originally presented in the same manner as vaudeville, with fourth-wall breaking and loud audiences, and they felt license to use the same devices.

AskHistorians,"Was the Maginot Line a bad strategy, or a good strategy badly executed?","PART 1

The Maginot Line was a good strategy based on the context of the time, and for the cost of 2-3% of France's military budget was money well spent.

To understand why [u/RepresentativePop](https://www.reddit.com/user/RepresentativePop/), you really need to understand the things that hamstrung French planning during and in-between the world wars. To this end I would highly recommend the writings of Robert Doughty and Eugenia Kieseling (see references at the end). These sources are the most modern historiography on the subject and avoid the ""pop history"" explanations that were popularised by writers in the 1950s and 60s, painting a much more accurate picture. A good example of the pop history narrative that links back to the part of your question on section 5 of the Maginot is the famous quote by Pétain on the Ardennes. It has been highlighted to show how out of touch the the army leadership was, however only the first part of the quote is ever used. The second half is just as important. Bold for emphasis: ""The Ardennes is impenetrable **so long as it's properly defended**."" Not an inaccurate statement. 

**Maginot Line**

First, let's address the Maginot Line. The French examined the idea of extending the Maginot Line along the Belgian border in some detail but rejected the idea, partly for political reasons to do with Belgian neutrality but also for some sound strategic reasons. Fun fact... the French actually offered to pay for the cost of fortifying the Ardennes region during the 1930's but this was declined by Belgium. Moving on:

(A) The terrain on the Franco-Belgian border was completely unsuited to defence and is largely open fields intersected by rivers making it exceedingly difficult to fortify. It also has a high water table meaning it was impractical to build underground, and as the area along the Franco-Belgian border is heavily industrialised, it would have caused a lot of disruption to vital industry had they begun building forts in the area.

(B) The main industrial and population centres of France are in the North-East of the country which presents a significant strategic problem. Here is a link showing a map of France, within the red circle lies 50% of France's GDP today: [https://imgur.com/a/92gJx](https://imgur.com/a/92gJx) Back in 1940 industry was even more concentrated in the North-East, and as Doughty lays out early in Seeds of Disaster and Breaking Point: Sedan, ninety percent of France's cloth and woollen industry was north of the Seine as were the majority of the chemical industry, 100% of the automobile factories and 100% of the aircraft industry. As noted before, lots of population lived near these industrial centres and as such they could not be lightly surrendered to the enemy. Aside from industry, this region also contained lots of natural resources, 75% of France's coal came from here and all of France's iron ore came from the Briey-Longwy basin in Lorraine. The French were aware they needed to move the battle away from this area if they were to have any chance in holding until their allies could come to their aid.

(C) Holding until here allies came to her aid was the most viable strategy for France. They knew in a 1 on 1 fight with Germany, they would be in serious trouble as Germany had more population and industry than France did (roughly 40 million compared to roughly 60 million, meaning Germany could call up twice as men of military age as France in this time period). France actually mobilised 300,000 less soldiers in 1940 than in 1914 (see the ""Hollow Years""). Fortifying and sitting on the border meant the battle would occur in some of the most industrially valuable parts of France, and France would not be able to hold until help came. So the French plan was to push the front forward and fight the Germans in Belgian, not French territory, along the Dyle river (in what was called Plan D or the Dyle Plan).

(D) Regarding your question about fortifications... The French command was fully aware that any ""line"", attacked with enough strength, could be breached. Gamelin (French Commander in Chief) wrote in 1935, “from 1915… whenever the necessary means were judiciously employed, one always broke a front.” (Kielsing, Arming Against Hitler) When the Maginot Line was completed in 1935 it was impenetrable to the German army of the day but the French had no illusions about the sanctity of fortifications. If they had extended the line along the Belgian border the forts in exposed areas (fields and rivers remember) would have been broken quickly by heavy artillery, bombers etc. and the French high command knew this in part due to what had happened to the Belgian forts at Liege in 1914 and their own experiences with the forts surrounding Verdun in 1916.

(E) Defending the border would present a significantly longer front to defend than moving into Belgium and defending along the Dyle river. This was a problem due to what I mentioned concerning the number of men that France could field. Besides a shorter front, the French needed the extra 22 divisions of the Belgian Army plus whatever the Dutch could field to even out the manpower imbalance.

The Maginot Line was a force multiplier in today's parlance, designed to screen the border regions, allow the army to mobilise and funnel the Germans through Belgium where the French army's mobile elements could manoeuvre and counter the German advance. It was a practical and useful response to the strategic challenges faced by France at the time. It actually allowed France to garrison the Franco-German border with only 15% of its total number of soldiers.

**Mobile Warfare (Or: Did the French Just Use Tanks as Infantry Support?)**

Now let's move on to the way the French army operated in the field. Perhaps the most pervasive criticism of the French in 1940 was that they failed to understand the changes that had taken place in warfare since WW1, chiefly that they hadn't embraced combined arms and mobile warfare. However as Kiesling shows, the French military was well aware of new theories on mobile warfare. A resurgent Germany forced on France the problem of translating strategic ideas into a set of specific actions. However between theory and practice there were political, social and economic obstacles that caused a number of problems. France was limited by her political institutions, history and other factors, as were other powers.

It's worth noting that in 1940 France had:

7 x Motorised Infantry Divisions

5 x Mechanised Cavalry Divisions

4 x DCr or Division Cuirassée de Réserve (a heavy armoured division, light on infantry)

3 x DLM or Division Légère Mécanique (a well balanced medium armoured division including motorised infantry, artillery, AA and anti-tank sections)

In addition to this there were indeed tanks designed for infantry support, these consisted of 30 independent tank battalions generally deployed in regiments of two battalions each and assigned to army and corps reserve formations.

The DCr and DLMs were the functional equivalent of the German Panzer divisions, that is the French envisaged using these in the breakthrough phase of battle. France had 7 of these divisions to the 10 Panzer divisions Germany had. When you account for the differences in population and the relative size of the two armies, they were therefore roughly equal in terms of mechanisation."
AskHistorians,Alexander the Great famously founded several cities bearing his name during his conquests. What does founding a city actually look like in this context? What structures were built? How was the city populated?,"Hello! I'm going to attempt to answer this question. It is quite difficult to do so, however, because while sources do talk about the technical side of founding new cities around this time, they often do not really explain why or how they were actually built.

Alexander probably founded many of his cities as bases of supply and/or administrative centers for his empire. As he and his army marched east, the new cities would provide the logistical support of his army, enabeling him to more effectively exploit the resources of the newly subjugated peoples and territories.

These new cities were primarily settled by Greeks. The Greeks that settled down in these towns probably had similar motives to move into their new homes when compared to their countrymen who settled Greek colonies all over the Mediterranean and Black Sea coast in earlier centuries.

Since we're talking about the 4rd to 3rd century BCE, we can safely assume that these new Greek settlements had a planned layout. After a suitable location was selected, based on factors like natural defendability, the availability of resources and connections to other nearby settlements, construction would begin with the building of basic infrastructure. Many Greek settlements followed a strict grid pattern with main streets intersected by more narrow side alleys. Space for public and residential structures was reserved on long plots between these streets. The Agora and temples would be located in the center of the new town. The city's main point of defense would be the Akropolis, often situated on the highest point of the area. The Greek's adherance to the grid was quite strict, as they often even ""ignored"" local topography - bulding stairs or stepways when a road became too steep. In addition to roads, Greeks built waterways, aquaducts and sewer systems when possible and necessary.

A good example of a city like that is Priene, in modern day Turkey. When Alexander took over the area from the Persians, construction in the area of Priene had already begun. Under Alexander's rule, Priene was to become a model city. We can see Alexanders' direct involvement in the founding of this town with his funding and dedication of the local temple of Athena, designed by the famous architect Pytheos (who also designed the mausoleum of Halicarnassus). Other rich Greek and Macedonian citizens followed suit, privately funding the construction of public buildings such as the Stoas along the agora, temples, meeting spaces and recreational buildings like the theatre and stadium. They did this to increase their local influence and gravitas.

After the infrastructure was laid out and basic services could be provided, the city would gradually be settled, mostly by Greeks, as I stated earlier. These Greeks were usually incentivized to move to a new town by a local ruler with attractive tax policies. In addition, a new town could provide a Greek citizen who struggled to find work in his homeland a chance to start a new life with more space, food, and good business opportunities. They would start to build homes on the free plots in the grid, eventually filling up the city. This process could take anywhere from a few months to a decades or even centuries, depending on the location of the new city and the wealth of the surrounding area.

EDIT 1: I feel that it is important to add that the term ""colony"" itself is disputed. I chose to use it in my answer for reasons of brevity and ease of understanding. However, ""Colony"" implies a relationship between the conqueror and the conquered, where the former subjugates and usually violently exploits the latter. This was not always the case in ancient Greece. Many colonies were founded as trading posts, *Emporia*, with relatively temporary Greek settlers like merchants and sailors in addition to a larger population segment of locals. Some others were founded by Greeks for Greeks, but eventually integrated with the local communities and even accepted local customs as their own. I explain a bit more about this in another answer, where we see that Alexander the Great actually uses integration of cultures to prevent rebellion in newly conquered territories."
AskHistorians,How did people who were voluntarily immured go to the toilet?,"This is a fascinating question. I don't have a lot of direct references to the elimination of waste, but I have a good idea of how this might have happened, given the everyday realities of medieval life. The people you're describing are called ""anchorites"" or ""anchoresses"" depending on their gender. They would be enclosed in a small chamber in a local church, and the idea was that they were ""dead to the world;"" they would dedicate the rest of their lives to praying for the church and its parishioners. 

Although the anchorites were nominally closed off from the world, their cells did have apertures and windows. They would receive meals through these windows, but more importantly, they would receive the Eucharist through the windows, thus allowing them to continue to receive the sacraments that, from a medieval (and modern Catholic) point of view, were essential to life. They were not, however, as closed off from the world as you'd expect. A number of them exerted influence outside their cells, talked to people, and saw visitors. Margery Kempe, the famous English mystic, met and spoke to a number of anchorites for spiritual guidance, including Julian of Norwich. These anchorites, then, were not as closed off from the world as we might think (or, indeed, as they might have wanted to be). I've attached a photo of an anchorage at the bottom of this post. You can clearly see that there was ample space for objects and conversation to pass through to the anchorite. These anchorages were all different, of course, but it should give you an idea. It's also worth noting that it was possible, it seems, to enter and leave some anchorages; the *Ancrene Riwle* (Anchorite's Rule) complains that some anchoresses ate meals outside with guests. It also specifies that guests should not be allowed to sleep in the anchorage. The actual possibility of this depended on the size of the anchorage's apertures and the strictness of its rule, as leaving the cell was somewhat frowned upon.

So how was waste disposed of? The short answer is that chamber pots were probably used. The anchorite would use the chamber pot and then pass it through the windows of the anchorage to be emptied. This, as it turns out, is not so different from the way waste was handled in the rest of the medieval world, and especially in cities. The most common way to dispose of waste in urban environments was to use a chamber pot and then to empty it somewhere discrete (or not discrete; numerous cities had laws about where one could or couldn't empty a chamber pot). This was a public health risk to the larger cities, and they did their best to regulate it. With this in mind, though, we can form an image of the anchorite as little worse off than their urban contemporaries, at least in this regard; of course, in the city, one could find considerably more luxury than in the enclosed cloister.

AskHistorians,"People say Einstein was a patent clerk before he became a professional physicist as a way to show that people in ""lowly"" jobs can eventually achieve greatness, but I've always suspected Einstein wasn't just alphabetizing folders. What did a European patent clerk in 1905 do, and how technical was it?","Einstein had very little success getting employed as a permanent teacher in 1901 (he had a temporary job as one), and was thrilled when the Swiss Patent Office in Bern had a job opening. He applied for the position of Engineer Class II, which was a technical job. He was, during this time, finishing hi PhD thesis, and beginning to really work out his ideas on electromagnetism that would eventually evolve into Special Relativity. In 1902 he moved to Bern and also began looking for students to tutor a well. His ""tutorial"" sessions sound more like wide-ranging discussion groups than what we might normally think of a tutor today. The spent a lot of time, for example, on the physical philosophy of Ernst Mach, who was a big influence on Einstein's thinking (one of Mach's tenets was that if something could not be measured, it should not be introduced as a concept in science — Einstein's key approach to Special Relativity is highly dependent on redefining space and time in terms of their measurement, and he dismissed the need for a luminiferous aether on the basis of its being unmeasurable). 

Einstein's day job, at the patent office, was similarly interesting to him. He was not alphabetizing folders. He was a patent inspector, an engineer who was evaluating patent applications for their technical merit. The approach his boss pushed was to evaluate every patent as if everything the inventor said was wrong — to push against the inventor's way of thinking and independently evaluate the technical merits of what was being described. So this was very fitting for someone like Einstein, who already was accustomed to imposing a great skepticism on received truths. It also involved a lot of mental imagination, as Einstein was evaluating claims for how things worked, not the devices themselves. So he was imagining how something was supposed to work, and seeing if it made sense. He was, in a way, a quality control officer for new technology, especially electromechanical technology. And he turned out to be extremely good at the job.

Peter Galison, from whose book _Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps_ (Norton, 2004) the above (and below) facts come from, further argues that Einstein would have been exposed, at that time, to a huge number of patents on electromechanical timekeeping and time coordination, as this was a very active area of innovation in Europe in the early 20th century. These patents involve making real some of the same kinds of time thought-experiments that Einstein would later use in talking and thinking through Special Relativity. Galison argues that this work at the patent office, rather than being irrelevant, was actually pretty core to Einstein's thinking. In Galison's argument, it was Einstein realizing that time synchronization was relative that got him firmly on the path to Special Relativity, and that working on time synchronization patents in a city famed for its clocks had something to important to do with that. Galison furthermore argues that Einstein's early papers look, in their form and especially approach to citation, much more like patent specifications than they do scientific papers of his day. 

Whether one goes all the way with Galison on that, it is still quite clear that this time period in his life is where the ideas of Special Relativity came from, and the specifics of being in Bern, of working at the patent office during the day, seem not at all irrelevant to that. If one goes through what he was doing, thinking about, reading, and so on, one finds lots of obvious influences on his later work (like the aforementioned Mach). 

Einstein worked at the Bern patent office from June 1902 until October 1909. We have very little records of his day to day work there, as most were routinely destroyed at some point in the long past. The only ones we do have exist because they somehow ended up in lawsuits at the time. One of them, interestingly enough, is about gyroscopic compasses, a subject that during his work Einstein became so expert in that he would much later, in 1926, contribute to a patent by a major firm and which he received significant royalties from. He also did some practical engineering/inventing work on his own during this time, tinkering with little electromechanical devices.

Einstein seems to have genuinely been a good fit for the kind of work and mindset of the patent examiner. He spoke of the work as ""a veritable blessing for me,"" as ""it enforced many-sided thinking and also provided important stimuli to physical thought.""   Later he would talk about how when he evaluated texts, he claimed that ""the
conventions at the Patent Office have driven my standards to exaggerated heights."" 

Galison ultimately argues that for various reasons, we tend to imagine Einstein as a ""philosopher-scientist"" whose head was kept very much in the clouds and away from the mundanities of the practical world. It is a role that Einstein himself was happy to play later in his life, slotting into an existing cultural idea in a way that benefited him (even if it was not quite true in many ways; contrary to that idea, for example, he was very politically active, and used his fame in science as a vehicle for pushing for a whole manner of political programs, including civil rights, socialism, nuclear disarmament, and so on). Instead, Galison suggests, for this period of his life we should perhaps as _also_ being a ""patent officer-scientist"" — a person who has to engage in a way both practical and abstract with the cutting edge of technology in an extremely skeptical and systematic fashion. Adding this to our ""Einstein"" model (along with the politics) produces, in my mind, a much more vigorous and interesting character than the ""philosopher-scientist"" model does on its own. 

Einstein left the patent office in 1909, after his theory of Special Relativity had become more widely known and engaged with (promoted early on by the venerable Max Planck, who is likely why an oddball outsider like Einstein got taken seriously). He took at job at the University of Zurich, and then had a sequence of other university jobs while he completed his theory of General Relativity. His superstardom would not come until 1918, with the confirmation of one of the predictions of General Relativity (the bending of starlight by gravity) from the eclipse observations of Sir Arthur Eddington. Then he became the famous Dr. Einstein, and his fame only grew from that point on (and was amplified further by the invention of the atomic bomb). But the patent office appears to have been a very ideal incubator for someone like Einstein — perhaps better than a job at a university, one might speculate, as it not only provided him with the opportunity to explore very heterodox ideas without any fear of repercussions, but it also provided a source of possible inspiration and a daily workout of his critical muscles."

AskHistorians,Why didn’t English develop gendered words for ‘cousin’?,"/r/linguistics and /r/asklinguistics are good subs for questions like this! 

To start with, *cousin* is a loanword from Old French and it was loaned to English during the Middle English period, around 1000 years ago. There's a simple answer here, in Old French *cosin* in masculine and *cosine* in feminine were only distinguished by a final unstressed sound which either may have been ignored when the word was borrowed or (as happened to all these unstressed sounds in English) been lost over time. 

But what's more interesting is the fact that English kinship terms so greatly rely on French. 

Because in fact, almost all English terms for extended family (known as collateral terms) are either Old French loans such as *aunt*, *uncle*, *niece*, *nephew* and *grandparent* or modeled on Old French terms, such as *grandfather*, *grandmother*, *grandson*, *granddaughter* and *grandchild* (*grand* is Old French and the second part mirrors the English equivalent of the family member in French). 

What does this tell us? Basically that the entire stock of collateral kinship terms was replaced by loans. How could this happen? Well, many of these kinds of terms are related to one's place within society; your clan or even marriage. 

In many cultures, maternal and paternal relatives are treated differently, you might belong to one clan or the other and you might be pushed to or forbidden from marrying family members from one side. 

It just so happens that the reason why Middle English absorbed so many Old French terms in the first place was an event that came with overwhelming changes to England's political and social structures - William the ~~Bastard~~ Conqueror's invasion. 

Kinship terms are often categorized based on patterns named after prototypical examples. Modern English has an Eskimo system, which focuses on the nuclear unit in distinguishing parents from their siblings and your siblings from their cousins, but using much vaguer terms for how these folks are all related to you. 

For many languages, using the same term for your father's sister and your mother's brother's wife would be as bizarre as using the same term for your brother and your mother's brother would be for us. 

Old English appears to not have had an Eskimo kinship system. The evidence varies wildly and can be interpreted in different ways. But it seems to have had what's described as a Sudanese system, with a strong focus on distinguishing between paternal and maternal relatives. 

There are no clear terms for cousins, but one that appears is *mōdrige*, which both referred to your mother's sister and a female cousin of some sort. Another is *swēor*, which referred to both a *father-in-law* and a male cousin of some sort, probably indicating that marrying the offspring of your male cousins was common at some point (and some place) during the Old English period. 

There were likely a variety of terms and cousins were probably grouped more based on whether they were of maternal/paternal relation and may have not even been considered family if they were of a certain relation. 

This Sudanese system seemed to have already been weakening and collapsing into the modern Eskimo system during the Old English period and shifting towards a focus on the nuclear family. 

The Norman conquest and imposition of new taxes as well as censuses (William I himself ordered the Domesday Book, a huge survey of England) likely contributed to the death of the old system and replacement with not only an Eskimo style more like what's found in Romance languages, but the usage of Romance terms in place of the old ones."
AskHistorians,"Why did the Prince Regent (later George IV) order several royal coffins opened, including Henry VIII and Charles I?","The reason the coffins were located was that a new, expanded Royal Vault was being added to St. George's Chapel to increase capacity in preparation for the death of George III (the Prince Regent's father) and the workmen knocked a hole through the wall into an older vault in the process that contained the coffins of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, as well as the coffin of a stillborn baby of Queen Anne's placed there in 1698. Charles I's coffin had been placed in this older vault after his execution, but subsequent renovations to St. George's under the Cromwells had prevented his son (Charles II) from finding the coffin after the Restoration of the monarchy. An outstanding question is why, when the vault was clearly opened in 1698 to place the coffin of the stillborn child no one thought to make a note that Charles I was in there. Possibly the records were lost, or it was never recorded at all (or not noticed by the person tasked with placing the baby's coffin). 

The coffin, when located, had ""King Charles 1648"" clearly inscribed onto the top. Because of uncertainty about the fate of Charles's body the Prince Regent had the coffin opened to confirm who was in it. There is a (very detailed) account of the condition of body written by one of the King's physicians who was present, Sir Henry Halford. The NIH has an historical article from a 1921 medical journal describing what happened and quoting from Halford's account [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7946126/pdf/annmedhist155900-0098b.pdf) if you are interested in reading more. Scroll down below the short article ""Machiavelli on Tuberculosis"" and the account starts there. The head was lifted out of the coffin and shown to those present. The Prince Regent and his party were able to identify the body as clearly that of King Charles I, as the head was well-preserved enough that it still looked like paintings of the king in the Royal Collection. ""On 1 April 1813 the coffin was opened in the presence of the Prince Regent, the Duke of Cumberland, Count Munster, the Dean of Windsor, Benjamin Charles Stevenson and Sir Henry Halford. Halford gives a full account of the findings in his essay."" (Morris, J.S. 2007). The coffins of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour and the unnamed child of Queen Anne were not disturbed at that time, or if they were no record was made. Charles's coffin was then re-sealed and the group left the vault, which was closed by workmen. 

An interesting postscript to the opening of the coffin is that Halford somehow (there is controversy as to rather they were ""gifted"" by the Prince Regent after being left out of the coffin in error when it was re-sealed, or stolen) came into possession of several pieces of Charles's body including a vertebra, a tooth and some hair. Somewhat morbidly he used the vertebra as an object of conversation at dinner parties, per Morris 2007 quoting JF Clarke ""he kept it as a curiosity; used to pass it around the dinner table after dinner for the examination of his guests.” 

In 1888 his grandson, also named Sir Henry Halford, returned them to the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII) out of concern for what would become of them after his death. Prince Edward had them returned to the vault in a newly made box. When the vault was opened that year it was discovered that Henry VIII's coffin had cracked open, possibly damaged by workmen opening the vault. Those present, including Edward, glanced inside and noted bones and some traces of a beard remaining.

AskHistorians,"In 1176 Henry II ‘took every castle in England into his hand, and removing the castellans of the earls and barons, put in his own custodians.’ How did this not cause total civil war?","This answer will be quite short because it's rather simple. The quote comes from Roger of Howden, who says he: 

> took every castle in England into his hand, and removing the castellans of the earls and barons, put in his own custodians; he did not even spare his intimate counsellor Richard de Lucy, the justiciar of England, but took from him his castle of Ongar.""

Despite appearances from Roger of Howden's account, the redistribution of the castles was a tactful piece of statecraft designed to stabalise the kingdom after a disruptive revolt from 1173-4. This revolt included powerful nobility but most notably Henry's own wife and children. Henry won that war in Britain rather handily, with around 20 rebel castled destroyed. Some of the more quarrelsome noblemen that posed a challenge to Henry had - for the moment - been subdued. Two of the worst, the Earl of Chester and the Earl of Leicester, were in prison. So was Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry's wife. His children were offered some concessions to keep them happy without seriously diminishing Henry's own power (and nowhere near enough concessions to undo what he had gained by defeating several earls). Henry was criticised by some for being somewhat lenient to the rebels; he did not strip anyone of their titles or deprive them of legitimately held domains and he did not press his advantage once he had the upper hand, preferring instead to negotiate a peace. As of 1177, all the major rebels had been restored to the lands they held before the revolt. 

But from 1174 to 1177, the noblemen who were both powerful enough to oppose the king and angry enough to do it were in prison. Given that his enemies were too chained up to oppose him further, he took the opportunity to re-assert his authority. In 1176 he sent out the royal justices to assess the state of law and order in the land and enforce punishment where it had lapsed due to the war. He reissued and strengthened the Assize of Clarendon, which diminished the role of local nobility in the courts and transferred it into royal officials and local juries. As part of this re-establishment of royal authority, he used his status as the liegelord of all England to take control of castles across the land, sort out which ones were legally built and which ones were illegal, and destroy all the illegal ones. This was a right the English king always had but rarely used because running dozens of castles is - and this is the technical term - an impractical pain the arse. 

That is probably another reason there wasn't a revolt over it: it had to be temporary. Even a control freak like Henry II could not possibly run all those castles (or afford to), and indeed he reallocated them to noblemen over the following year. Generally speaking, he tried to be fair and balanced in the reallocation of castles to the noblemen. If he took a castle from a nobleman, he usually gave them another in compensation from somewhere else. He wasn't trying to permanently take the castle away from the nobility, he was systematically seeking to destroy illegally built castles and then redistribute the legal ones to prevent the centralisation of power around the earls. When William the Conqueror allocated land to his followers after 1066, a key part of his policy was to scatter the lands. The Bishop of Lincoln got a chunk of Buckinghamshire, for example. Over the generations, some noblemen had managed to consolidate their lands into a more localised domain through marriage, purchases, and royal concessions. Henry II primarily wanted to undo this and re-scatter the domains of the earls so that, if they wanted to raise an army against the king, they had to march their forces across most of England to bring them together, giving the king ample warning and intelligence on any fomenting rebellion. Once this process of redistributing castles was complete in 1177, Henry II felt secure enough to release the rebels and restore them to their titles with their reorganised lands. 

The seizure of castles was a measure to facilitate a redistribution of castle ownership to diminish the ability of earls to centralise power and oppose royal authority or strong-arm fellow barons. Few, if any, earls suffered serious losses to their lands as a result of this process, so there was not much to rebel against. The goal was reasonable, the net cost to the earls was minimal, and the people troublesome enough to cause trouble were already locked up for having rebelled a couple of years earlier."
AskHistorians,"My father likes to tell me “Black” people taught “White” people how to bath. I recently asked him for context and he explained to me the Moors taught people in Spain, England, and Portugal better hygiene. Can I get some more context on this?","Despite the fact that this is a case where my expertise is directly pertinent to the question--I have written a history of hygiene, body image and consumer culture in 20th Century southern Africa--I hesitated a bit before undertaking an answer to this question.

The reason for my hesitation is that this overall topic has lately become a sort of strange eddy of conversation in social media, swirling off as a kind of fractured debate between white supremacists and Afrocentrists and Black cultural activists with scholarly historians from several different areas of specialization feeling helpless to wrestle the whole conversation back to something more factual. 

At a deep anthropological level, practices of decorating, washing, marking and shaping the body have been a major part of how neighboring cultures differentiate themselves from one another--and as such, are often also part of how neighboring cultures denigrate or criticize one another, particularly using tropes around purity and uncleanliness. (Mary Douglas' famous book *Purity and Danger* provides a really good window into this level of cultural and social thought.)  

In the post-1400 CE time period, however, this common discourse about cultural difference got very powerfully entangled with two things (which were themselves already connected): the sudden appearance of Europeans in many parts of the planet that they previously had not visited or related directly to and the rise of modern discourses of racial difference, hierarchy and domination. 

There are some good examples in the early modern period in the era of ""first contact"" between Westerners and non-Western societies of commentary on or perceptions of the bodily habits and appearance of people on either side of those encounters. But especially between 1400 and 1600 CE, many of the views that we attribute to modern racism or racial ideology were not yet a standard or prominent part of those contacts, including uniformly negative characterizations of the cleanliness of the bodies of the other side of that cultural encounter. 

It's only in the 19th and 20th Century that we really see white Europeans and Americans describing non-white individuals and societies with highly charged, racist images of dirtiness and filth, often combined with regarding them as a source of disease and contagion. These ideas were sometimes the justification for or logic of spatial segregation (e.g., forcing colonial subjects or racialized populations to live in separate communities far away from white populations, usually communities with minimal or absent infrastructure and support). 

This is where things get really complicated in terms of the OP's question. Part of this evolution of the racialization of hygiene also included the creation among Europeans of a myth about their *own* past unhygienic behavior. Some of this wasn't mythological in the sense that early modern and late medieval European cities had relatively polluted water supplies or poor drainage and sewage, or lacked public bathing. Some of it was an exaggerated form of self-promotion originating from people backing projects of urban planning and infrastructure construction in European and American cities (e.g., look at us now! look at what we're building! we were so filthy before and now we're not!) What this led to was the building of an idea of medieval Europeans as anti-hygienic, as resisting bathing in water or wallowing in mud and filth. (Say, Monty Python's joke about knowing who the king is because he doesn't have shit all over him.) Some of this was also the specific by-product of Protestant critiques of medieval European society under the authority of the Catholic Church as corrupt, degenerate, and unclean and about the rise of humanism and its affection for Roman and Greek thought (and therefore also the material culture of Roman life, including the centrality of social bathing). 

This all became such a powerful truism--that Europeans were markedly unclean compared to other global societies prior to 1900--that I have to confess with some embarrassment that I bought into it myself a bit when I first started working on this subject around 1990. And there are scraps of truth to it. As Virginia Smith point out in her 2007 history *Clean*, late medieval Europeans began to adopt new clothing fashions that included undergarments and tight-fitting tailoring, which in turn created new ways to ""trap the body's evacuations in a layer above the skin"", whereas many other societies in the Mediterranean, Near East, and Asia wore looser-fitting clothing and robes that made it easier to stay clean and smell less. There were also forms of body asceticism that circulated in Christian institutions or rituals where washing was avoided, but that appears in other religious traditions too in other parts of the world from time to time. 

Many other common ideas--that spices and perfumes were desired to cover the odor of rotting meat and unwashed bodies, or that Europeans commonly had a cultural objection to washing or cleanliness, are basically untrue. But it is true, Smith notes, that Islamic communities around the Mediterranean, including in Iberia, specifically retained and extended Roman-inspired architecture for bathing and sanitation, and became known as a kind of ideal of cleanliness and courtly life throughout Europe as a result. 

Which brings around again to the OP's idea, now echoed across social media, that Europeans had to be tutored in cleanliness by the Moors, by Muslims generally, by Africans, by Japanese, etc.  This is essentially a further extension of the myths built by Renaissance, Enlightenment and modern Europeans about *themselves,* myths that built on some half-truths--and the extension in this case is intended to frame modern white racism about non-white hygiene and bodies as supreme hypocrisy, to flip the racial imagery on its head.

That's a very understandable objective. I have a lot of sympathy for the thought behind the move, not the least because there's a sort of truth down buried down in it. Not just in terms of the hygienic past of Europeans, but also in terms of how white European and Americans have used hygiene as an excuse for racial segregation and discrimination and how that remains a part of racist culture today. Throwing racist ideas back on their originators is a powerful strategem in many respects. It's also true that 19th and 20th Century whites reproducing those racist ideas created humiliating and degrading myths about the societies they were discriminating against. When I was interviewing people in Zimbabwe about soap, cosmetics and other products for the body, people were often palpably worried that I was operating from the preconception that local African cultures were (or had been) unclean, which I already knew was absolutely not the case, that precolonial bodily practices included frequent washing, the uses of natural oils to protect the body from dirt, and the use of soap-like botanica. Similarly, it's true that medieval Islamic courts and urban communities had infrastructure for bathing that many European communities lacked (and that many European courts admired). ""Flipping the script"" on modern bodily racism is in that sense even somewhat factual. 

But not as much as is thought to be the case in some current social media discussions. Medieval kings were not the only ones who did not have shit on them; medieval Europeans did not wallow in mud or invariably crawl with lice. Medieval and early modern Europeans were just as interested in washing and remaining clean as human beings in any other past society."
AskHistorians,"How did Mormonism transition from a rogue, semi-threatening religion against which President Buchanan sent military forces, to a mainstream, non-threatening American religion no one gives a second thought to?","I think I can provide an answer to this one. Qualifications: I have an MA in Religious Studies with a focus on religion in North America and I am a PhD Candidate in that same specialty currently writing my dissertation which has Mormonism as one of the primary topics. 

A good place to start with this question is with historian Armand Mauss. In his book [The Angel and the Beehive: The Mormon Struggle with Assimilation](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Angel_and_the_Beehive/wTBUCGwdG8MC?hl=en&gbpv=0)  he asserts that throughout its history the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has swung between two impulses: cultural assimilation and retrenchment. 

He argues that the church goes through distinct periods where it will make efforts to assimilate to the broader culture, and periods where it will retrench to emphasize those elements which make it unique or ""peculiar"" (his term). The phenomenon that you are asking about is a result of periods of assimilation, particularly in the post-war period. 

With that introduction out of the way, there are several events throughout Mormon history which we can point to to answer your question about assimilation.

One of the biggest is what we call the 1890 Manifesto wherein then President of the church Wilford Woodruff issued a proclamation pausing the practice of plural marriage (yes, it officially is paused, rather than abolished). There were several mitigating factors that led to this; Utah Territory was attempting to join the US as a state, but the practice of plural marriage was a sticking point. The 1887 Edmunds-Tucker Act had functionally disincorporated the church, authorizing federal agents to raid and seize church assets and Mormon men in particular were being arrested with increasing frequency for bigamy. Essentially the church was at an impasse: they could abandon plural marriage or they would be driven out of the US and associated territories. 

While it is true that they had been driven out of several previous states they had established a prosperous settlement in Utah and the current leader, Woodruff, was less willing than previous had been to uproot and flee. He began quietly refusing to approve new plural marriages, and then released the proclamation in 1890 after claiming to have received a direct revelation from God (you can read it [here](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/official-declaration-1-manifesto?lang=eng)). This concession set the stage for Utah to become a state, which it did in 1896. There are a lot of good references for further reading, I recommend the work of Michael Quinn, particularly The Mormon Hierarchy.

This is already getting long, but it is a big question! The next event towards assimilation was the 1903 election of Reed Smoot as a senator to represent Utah. He was purposefully chosen to run because he was well-respected throughout the state and, more importantly, he was not a polygamist. He was politically savvy, friendly, and middle class, thus combating popular perceptions of Mormons at the time. However he was not seated, and there was a four year long senate hearing to determine whether he was fit to serve. Ultimately this was a first amendment issue, and Smoot argued that his faith was a personal, not professional, matter. He sort of created the blueprint for how most members of minority religious groups would deal with questions about their faith when running for office. Ultimately he was able to take his seat and held it for 30 years. Historian Kathleen Flake wrote *The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle*, which is probably the definitive book on Reed Smoot. She argues that the US senate’s solution was to require Mormons to conform to protestant norms, particularly to present like a denomination with standardized behaviors and obedience to the law, and in return they got political representation and legitimacy. 

We can skip forward a little to the Eisenhower administration. In 1952 Eisenhower chose Ezra Taft Benson, who was a member of The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (meaning he was high up in the governing body of the LDS Church) to be Secretary of Agriculture. Benson was a prominent leader in the church, so his appointment to the cabinet granted major legitimacy. This was a huge turning point, and arguably cemented the relationship between the LDS Church and the Republican Party, whereas previously church hierarchy had been much more bipartisan (see Mauss, 115). Benson would go on the serve as President of the church and was instrumental in shaping its conservative political identity, particularly in response to the hippie movement, feminism, and other socially progressive movements of the 1960s. In this era Mormons took on the squeaky clean image that they (largely) still have because their image was shaped in the public consciousness by religious elements like patriotism, an emphasis on so-called family values, etc. rather than those that were perceived as peculiar or deviant.

There is a ton more that could be said on this topic, particularly about the political shift like their opposition to the ERA, but a final thing I will talk about happened in 1978, which was the year that the church made a doctrinal change that some argue was nearly as important as the 1890 Manifesto. Prior to 1978 Black men were not considered to hold the priesthood (very quickly: in LDS doctrine men over the age of 12 are endowed with the priesthood which grants them both special authorities and powers and is important for participating in Temple ceremonies and progression in the afterlife). Black men did not have the priesthood and thus were limited in both spiritual and communal authority and were barred from leadership positions. This doctrine (rightly!) received heavy criticism both internally and externally, and was one of the most visible holdovers of the type of religious peculiarity which put Mormons outside of the mainstream. In 1978 then church President Spencer Kimball, after many prayer sessions, received a revelation which removed all barriers preventing Black men from holding the priesthood. The change was announced in June of 1978 and is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants as [Official Declaration 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/official-declaration-2-every-faithful-worthy-man?lang=eng). 

Ultimately I would argue that it was the political stability that the church gained post Reed Smoot which allowed for the cultural and theological negotiations which were necessary to take them from the margins of American society into the mainstream."
AskHistorians,Southern states in the US seceded in the 1860s fearing that slavery would be abolished. But couldn’t these states have blocked abolition for a very long time if they had just stayed?,"This is a question that often stumps people, and the very fact that Republicans, by their own admission, couldn't and wouldn't abolish slavery directly is often seized on as ""proof"" that the war was actually not over slavery. Of course, the war was over slavery, but if Republicans weren't a threat to it, why secede in the first place? In fact, Republicans had a comprehensive anti-slavery program that Southerners perceived as a threat so big that secession was justified, a move that was profoundly ironic for it brought about the very revolution they were hoping to avoid sooner and more radical that it could have been otherwise. The issue has, in my view, four different components:  1) what Republicans said they would do, based on their understanding of constitutional and political limits; 2) what Republicans actually would do, how far were they willing and able to push their anti-slavery convictions; 3) what pro-slavery Southerners thought Republicans would do, and their perceptions of the possible effects of these policies; and, 4) what pro-slavery people thought should be done in the face of this perceived threat, and what the results of these countermeasures would be. Let's analyze all these points, shall we? 

The Republican Party was alarming to pro-slavery people because it was a party built on the conviction that slavery was morally wrong. It was, furthermore, a sectional party that drew all its strength from the North, with nil or marginal support in most of the South. Republicans boldly said that slavery was morally wrong and should be ended by political action. But, how was this to be done? As you say, ending slavery required a constitutional amendment. It was unfeasible, and no one suggested this seriously as a solution because it was simply not politically possible. Indeed, abolitionists were more likely to say that the entire constitution was hopelessly pro-slavery and should be scrapped because under it the Federal government had simply no power whatsoever to interfere with slavery. All Republicans, except perhaps some very radical abolitionists, subscribed to this ""Federal consensus"". Slavery, they believed, could only be abolished by the states themselves. In the view of most Republicans, slavery was a decrepit old system, so inferior to Northern free labor that it would eventually collapse and be peacefully and constitutionally abolished in every state. Because the enslaved had no incentives to work, because plantation culture depleted the fields, and because slavery denigrated White labor and encouraged feudal relations that stifled progress and freedom, there was simply no way slavery would survive. The natural march of progress would result in abolition, just as it had happened in all states north of the Mason-Dixon line. Why, then, was slavery still alive in the South in the 1850's, and abolition so far away? Because of the Slave Power. 

The ""Slave Power"" was an idea that occupied a very important place in the minds of Northerners, and it was probably the chief cause of their dislike of slavery, rather than the plight of the enslaved. According to it, slavery had been dying, something the wise Founders intended and expected. But a cabal of wealthy slaveholders banded together to hijack the institutions of government and extend unnatural protection and help to the hated institution. Seizing control over the Southern states and the Federal government, the Slave Power artificially kept slavery alive, subverting both human progress and the true will of the Southern people. Republicans pointed to the fact that most presidents had been slaveholders or their advocates, to the disproportionate Southern influence in the Congress and the Supreme Court, to the many pro-slavery measures taken. The events of the 1850's lent special credence to the Slave Power conspiracy, with Buchanan's blatant efforts in favor of slavery, the Dred Scott decision, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and other such incidents that seemed to show that Republicans were right, that slaveholders were holding the Federal government hostage for their own ends. This harmed White men as well, because it meant that the progress of all the nation was stopped and that Southern states were free to tramp on the rights of Northern states, as seen in the Fugitive Slave Act. The solution, they said, was voting the Republican ticket, which would overthrow the Slave Power and start a new policy that would place slavery on the path of ultimate extinction. 

But, what was this policy? If Republicans had already admitted they couldn't abolish slavery or interfere with it, what could they do? Some have taken this to mean that Republicans had no plan, that they wouldn't do anything at all against slavery. In truth, Republicans had a comprehensive program of anti-slavery action *within* the constitution. The centerpiece was the idea of ""Freedom National"". The Constitution, Republicans argued, only recognized and protected slavery in the states, that is, slavery as a condition, as an institution, was only enacted and sustained by local state law. Under the Federal government, slavery was not recognized. Proof of this was how the word was nowhere in the constitution, instead the euphemistic ""persons held to service or labor"" being used. Consequently, everywhere that was under the purview of the Federal government was free - the high seas, between state lines, the national capital, and most importantly, the territories. If slavery was prohibited in the territories, if they were ""free soil"", then slavery, with no room to expand, would wither and die. A Republican president could also appoint anti-slavery officeholders to the Southern states, and take other active steps to continuously attack slavery within the Constitution's limits. Soon enough, without the protection of the Slave Power, with no room for expansion, and with the hitherto deluded masses now awake to the evils of slavery, movements to abolish the institution would spring up in every state and eventually result in the destruction of slavery across the United States.

Then, Republicans said that they would not attack slavery directly, but they also candidly said that they would attack it indirectly, that their goal was the ultimate extinction of slavery, and that these methods worked. Some, upon looking at them, may be disappointed, because they all contemplated gradual abolition decades in the future. Was the Southern reaction not justified then? If they just accepted, slavery could continue for decades more. However, Southerners came to believe that Republican policies would have far more sinister and inmediate effects. They agreed on the essential fact that slavery needed to expand and that an anti-slavery Federal government could do a lot to undermine it. The victory of a Republican would open the gates to the enslaved fleeing en masse or trying to revolt, to anti-slavery mails flooding the South, to people ""betraying"" the South and joining the Republican Party. They, as all reactionaries do, tended to exaggerate the methods and results of the Republican policies, charging that Lincoln was in favor of inmediate abolition, or of slave revolts, or of interracial marriage, etc. More than anything, pro-slavery Southerners simply didn't feel safe in a Union helmed by an openly anti-slavery Party. Even if slavery was not immediately abolished, they had to secede because such a situation would destroy their economic and political power long before slavery was legally abolished. 

Secession was not the inmediate response of all Southerners. Some believed that there was no need; others wished to wait for an ""overt act"". But by stoking popular passions and racial fears, secessionists were able to convince most Southerners that secession was the only appropriate response to the election of these radical anti-slavery men. It was a constitutional right, justly exercised to protect themselves from a sectional party that sought round-about ways to achieve an unconstitutional end. They could not accept Republican rule, with its assertion of slavery's evil, its free soil that seemed to trample on Southern rights, its commitment to fostering anti-slavery feelings in the South. By seceding, Southerners could perpetually secure slavery, and wouldn't have to share a government with a population so openly hostile to the ""peculiar institution"" so dear to their hearts, economy, and society. There probably wouldn't be any war, they said, and if there was they would easily whip those Yankees. But if they remained in the Union, eventually their society would be shattered. They couldn't wait for an ""overt act"" - the very election of Lincoln already was one, showing that the Federal government would be, from then on, probably anti-slavery. 

Were these fears justified? In some ways, yes. Republicans fully intended to move against slavery, and though these policies wouldn't abolish slavery for years to come, they would surely destabilize Southern society. Maybe they could have voted down slavery indefinitely at the Federal level, but this didn't matter if at the state level slavery was withering thanks to a hostile Federal government. In the view of the secessionists, they had to act. And when they seized the initiative, they pulled the rest of the Lower South along, and then the Upper South after Fort Sumter, when Lincoln had committed the ""overt act"" by showing his willingness to suppress the rebellion by force of arms instead of surrendering Republican principles. Yet, by doing this they started a war that resulted in a radicalization of Northerners, opening the possibility of slavery being abolished earlier and more radically than it could have been otherwise. In trying to prevent this by a counterrevolution, Southerners sparked the much more radical revolution they were hoping to avoid."
AskHistorians,What was happening publicly in Ireland that caused Sinead O'Connor to know by 1992 that there was rampant abuse in the Catholic Church?,"In her book *Rememberings,* O’Connor writes of the lead-up to the photo incident, “I’ve been pissed off for a few weeks because I’ve been reading *The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail* (a contrarian blasphemous history of the early church) but also finding brief articles buried in the back pages of Irish newspapers about children who have been ravaged by priests but whose stories are not believed by the police or bishops their parents report it to. So I’ve been thinking even more of destroying my mother’s photo of [Pope John Paul 2]” (page 178). 

Background: The 2009 Murphy Report documented the Archdiocese of Dublin’s institutional response to sexual abuse allegations. The report states that often a single Garda official would conduct the entire investigation. While the policy was officially to refer all sexual abuse complaints to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), a series of protocols and policies put into place in the mid-90s and later imply that referrals may not have been happening. Further, a single legal officer at the DPP could simply decide not to prosecute (page 94). The Murphy report also confirmed that the Archdiocese was reassigning accused priests without monitoring them. So O’Connor’s assertion that accusers were “not believed” probably appeared true because officials at the Garda, DPP, and Archdiocese often did not act meaningfully on the reports. 

Notably, Fr James Doyle was convicted in 1990 of indecent assault on a preteen boy after being caught by the boy’s father. That was widely reported (although the fact that Doyle was reassigned to England and continued to have access to children did not come out until 1994.) 

Back to the question: What did the general public in Ireland know in 1992? They knew of Doyle’s conviction and that it was only because the father caught him. They knew child abuse was going unreported in residential children’s homes run by the church because it was part of the public call for more oversight and regulation by both legal and health authorities that led to the Child Care Act of 1991. That law had been passed but not yet implemented, so the public knew there was no reporting by health boards if they were aware of child sexual abuse. (Murphy report p. 103). 

I didn’t go looking for the news articles O’Connor claimed to have read, but given the political context of trying to get child protection implemented and the publicity around Doyle, there’s no reason to disbelieve her.

Why it wasn’t widely recognized in the US is a different question I’ll let others handle. The Boston Globe [spotlight series](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/special-reports/2002/01/06/church-allowed-abuse-priest-for-years/cSHfGkTIrAT25qKGvBuDNM/story.html) is a good starting point on understanding the church’s coverup in the US."

AskHistorians,"Would the army actually care about a ""Private Ryan""?","Saving Private Ryan is loosely based on a true story, the case of Sergeant Fritz Niland, the youngest of four sons. As depicted in the film, the War Department was moving towards a ""sole survivor"" policy to remove men from combat units if their brothers had been killed.

The Niland family's tragedy began a few weeks before D-Day, when the oldest brother, Edward, had his B-25 shot down over Burma. Presumed dead, fortunately he parachuted out, and was rescued from a Japanese POW camp a year later. Edward would go on to outlive Fritz, dying in 1984.

The two middle brothers were not so lucky. Preston landed on Utah Beach with the 4th division, and was killed in action on the 7th. Bob landed with the 82nd Airborne, and was killed in rearguard action on the 6th. As with Private Ryan in the film, Sgt Fritz Niland landed with the 101st airborne. His C-47 was hit on approach, but he was able to jump out, miles off target; as a result, Fritz was also briefly believed dead.

Fritz managed to reunite with his company, where he learned Edward was believed dead, and then a week later met up with his brother Bob's division, the 82nd. Upon hearing that his brother Bob had been killed too, he persuaded a chaplain with the 101st, Father Francis Sampson, to help find Bob's grave. While they were searching hastily-dug graves across Normandy, they found the other brother, Preston's grave too.

Father Sampson notified the army of Fritz's situation and suggested he be reassigned to non-combat duties. Fritz continued to fight in the ETO with the 101st until he was posted to New York City as an MP in August, where he served until the end of the war. Fritz later claimed it took an order from President Roosevelt to get him to leave his unit. Fritz survived the war and died in 1983. The historian Stephen Ambrose wrote about Niland in ""Band of Brothers,"" his history of the 101st, which directly inspired Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (as well as the miniseries of the same name). But there was never any suggestion that a small unit be sent behind the lines to find Sgt. Fritz; in any case, he was already reconnected with the beachheads by the time the army realized the situation. Father Sampson had an interesting rest of the war, too; he was captured by the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge, and spent the last months of the war in a prison camp until it was liberated by the Red Army. He continued to serve as a US Army chaplain until retiring in 1971 as the Chief of Chaplains of the US Army.

There were a few other similar cases during the war. The Borgstrom family lost four of their six sons between March and August, 1944; the parents petitioned the Commandant of the Marine Corps to discharge their third son, Boyd, who was then serving in the South Pacific (the youngest son was only 15 in 1944, but was given a draft exemption as well). Charles Butehorn was killed in November, 1944; his brother Joseph died in the Pacific in May, 1945. The oldest brother, Henry, was serving in the Army Air Corps in Italy, and the army ordered him home, although by then combat operations in Europe had ended.

As these examples show, the Sole Survivor policy was ad-hoc during the Second World War. It was codified by Congress in 1948, and has been applied twice, in 2007 and 2012. The discharge is voluntary, and is not available in the case of a congressionally declared war. In no case was a small unit sent to rescue a sole survivor, although it was also never necessary.

AskHistorians,Has receiving the keys to a city ever been non-symbolic?,"The reception of the city's keys was a sign of surrendering, a way of pysically expressing that the village, city, or town had a new master, very much in the same way that someone receives the keys of a house of which they are masters. The keys themselves don't necessarily correspond to a lock in the gates, but quite usually they belong to the locks that secure the gates on the inside, in which case we see in documentation the giving of the locks and key. Pedro Fernández de Velasco, Constable of Castile, mentions this when Tordesillas capitulated before his troops:

  *And so doing, the gave and presented three keys to the gates of said town and two locks alongisde them to the mayors. To whom, and to the Council and Officers of the Good Men they said and required that from then on keep good guard and care of the village so the King would do with it what most convenient were.*

This was not unusual in any way, shape, or form. When someone gives away the keys, it is because he is master of the city, fortress, or palace, with the surrender of the keys being a way of recognising the new owner or lord and of never posessing that estate, fortress, or city ever again. When king Boabdil of Granada surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs on January 2nd 1492, he presented them the keys to the Alhambra. Alonso de Santa Cruz, a very good chronicler, gives a good account of the matter:

*And he gave the keys to the Alhambra and the other fortresses to the King, and the King gave them to the Queen, and the Queen gave them to prince John, and prince John gave them to the Count of Tendilla. That done, the Monarchs entered the Alhambra.*

Here we have a multiple transmission of the keys, and in a very precise order. They were received by Ferdinand, who was acting as supreme commander of the Castilian forces. Ferdinand then passed the keys to Queen Isabella, rightful proprietary queen of Castile, and hence new head honcho of the place. Isabella passed them to the prince, which was a sign of trust, seeing that he should one day rule, and in turn he finally gave the keys to the Count of Tendilla, who had been appointed governor of the Alhambra, so that last passing was from the future rightful owner to the proper designated custodian of the place.

And yes, opening the gate was quite a necessity indeed, and we do have records of such a thing happening. I will not abstain from telling the most peculiar version of it ocurring, which comes from the Crónica de Enrique IV de Castilla:

 *And then the people started going up, and two of those men went with one of the guards they had as prisoner to the keep and ordered him to call saying that the governor was coming, as he had been sleeping out of the fortress; and two servants who were in the keep opened the gate thinking that the governor was coming, and they were taken captive and threatened in order to shut up and give the keys to the keep at once or say where they were. And at once they gave the keys to Pedro de Vera, who immediately went to open the gate to the fortress, through which at once came all the people that were outside* 

There are also some good pictoral representations of keys to a city being surrendered. Two of them I truly enjoy, and I'll share here.

A miniature from the second half of the 14th century shows cardinal [Gil de Albornoz receiving the keys to several cities](https://i0.wp.com/elretohistorico.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cardenal-albornoz.jpg?resize=500%2C345&ssl=1) he recaptured for the pope, which he did in an effort to strengthen the papacy's position in Italy.

[Las Lanzas or The surrender of Breda](https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/las-lanzas-o-la-rendicion-de-breda/0cc7577a-51d9-44fd-b4d5-4dba8d9cb13a), one of Velázquez's finest paintings, depicts Justin of Nassau giving Ambrogio Spinola one of the keys to the city as a formal way of surrendering. Even though Spinola was some ten years younger than Justin of Nassau, the painting appears to show the opposite, which was a way Velázquez used in order to tell the story of a more experienced man defeating a ""greener"" one."
AskHistorians,"Alexander Hamilton had great success and helped build the United States, but by the end of the 1790s he told a friend that there is no place in this country for me. Why did he feel this way?","Hamilton was beholden to an *increasingly hostile* political environment. Ironically, he would prove to be ahead of his time -- modern America is almost entirely build around the Hamiltonian conception of the Constitution, the Economy, and the role of government, rather than its Jeffersonian counterpart -- but, at the time, the fledgling Republic was sympathetic to Jefferson's populistic ideals.

Hamiltonianism and Jeffersonianism, while **not** being comparable to modern political ideologies, being products of a distinct time period (the Age of Revolution and the Industrial Revolution), were part of an ideological battle that still, to some extent, plays out in different forms today.

Obviously, upon America's conception, there were two main parties: the Democratic-Republican Party, and the Federalist Party.

The **Federalist Party** (Hamilton) was, above all else, ***staunchly capitalistic***. Almost all of its stances, be they ""progressive"" or conservative, stemmed from this fundamental embrace of market forces. They strongly supported American industrialization, urbanization, free-market ideals, and the consequences of the like. Some of these consequences seem strangely progressive to the modern-day observer but are in fact natural results of the free market -- a relative openness towards minorities (after all, someone's race or place of birth doesn't affect the bottom line of the business), centralism (free trade would need a robust government that could protect property rights), heavy defense spending (to ensure American commercial interests), and tolerance towards immigration from the Caribbean (free movement of labor) are a couple examples. Obviously, some policies were unrelated to this core economic tenet (dogmatic patriotism, firm religiosity), but to understand the essence of the Federalists, all you need to know is that they were extreme capitalists -- at a time, mind you, when Adam Smith had scarce been published for twenty years.

The **Democratic-Republican Party** (Jefferson), on the other hand, was equal parts reactionary, populistic, and almost proto-socialistic. I think that the best modern example one could give here would be Huey Long gone libertarian, but it's really hard to map this ideology to modern terms. Essentially, ***the Democratic-Republicans were pining for the ""good old days"", and the ""common man"" who had been left behind by the new industries*** springing up daily in New England and the mid-Atlantic area, promising to protect their interests at all costs. This meant a lot of different things, but above all it meant representing the agrarian plantation interests of the South as well as the settlers of the frontier areas. Since the Federalists were capitalists, the Democratic-Republicans defined themselves in opposition to free-market capitalism -- they didn't have a clear economic stance, but they vaguely supported the Southern plantation system, imagining a nation of self-sufficient farmers rather than industrial traders as being the gold standard. They staunchly opposed government ""overreach"", the supposed ""depravity"" of federal policies, but didn't have all that much to support -- their agenda was largely *negative*, defined by fears rather than hopes.

Now, as you can guess, the lines for these parties were largely regional. The capitalistic, urban, relatively modern North tended to vote Federalist, whereas the South would vote consistently Democratic-Republican (also important to note is that the Federalists were far more consistently the party of abolition). Because of simple demographics, the South would normally win that debate (Pennsylvania would normally vote with the South despite being geographically Northern) -- the standard tally puts the South at 78 electors to the North's 61. Unless the Federalists would manage to hold onto every single one of their states, and flip at least one major Southern state (like Adams did in 1796 with Maryland), they had no real chance at winning.

Their saving grace, however, is that the single most important man in the nation -- George Washington -- was standing behind them. Officially nonpartisan, Washington was a Federalist in all but name, and this was clear to practically any political observer of the day. Hamilton, therefore, was the primary driver of Washingtonian policy -- hence his ""great successes"" that you mention.

However, policy success never *really* changed the fact that his party got screwed over by demographics. John Adams eked out a win in 1796, but that was really because of his status as Washington's deputy, not because of his ideological leanings. Indeed, when the ""Washington Effect"" wore off, Adams lost decisively to Jefferson (61%-39%). The fact is, Hamiltonian capitalism just wasn't an easy pill to swallow for agrarian Southern interests.

And that's what Hamilton meant when he said the country had no place for him anymore. His ideas had been vilified by a demagogic opposition, he was reviled in large swathes of the country for being a ""crafty, capitalist Northern merchant"", and was seen as a symbol of extremely threatening modernity. Politically, his beliefs doomed his chances of ever becoming President. He would be vindicated after the Civil War, when America would once and for all resolve the agrarian-industrial conflict in the latter's favor, and his legacy would be rehabilitated by those very same Northern urban dwellers who now controlled the levers of power in the nation and made up a majority of the population -- but at the time, not so.

**Edits:** 

Thanks for all the love and appreciation, guys! Really made my day :) 

I just wanted to address a couple things in the comments:

1.) *The 'socialism' point:* A lot of the people in the comments section are disagreeing with me on this one, for various reasons. I just wanted to clarify that when I called the Democratic-Republicans a ""proto-socialist"" party, I was not really referring to the formal ideology as introduced by Marx and later furthered by various ideologues throughout the world. I am talking about 'proto-socialism' in a more general sense of leftist, populist, reformist (as opposed to revolutionary) rhetoric, in the same way that many historians have counted Tiberius Gracchus as a proto-socialist. 

2.) *Tariffs are anti-Capitalistic:* Several have made the point that the Federalist party actively supported what were in effect anti-free market policies, such as using protective tariffs and government planning in order to advance American industry. I would argue that such measures were meant to be temporary stopgap solutions rather than something expected by the Federalists to be permanent measures. Perhaps, policy-wise, the Federalists did not always follow the principle of maximizing freedom in the market, but I think that the vision that they pushed for America was certainly one with a laissez-faire economy -- and, in my humble opinion, I think the latter is more important to the question (ie the public's qualms with Hamiltonian ideology). 

3.) *Democratic-Republicans were capitalist too:* I find this point to be extremely murky, in no small part because of the fact that the party itself was so divided. In making the point of Jefferson's anti-capitalism, I would cite Chomsky in Ch. 6 of *Understanding Power: ""Jefferson did not support capitalism; he supported independent production… The fundamental Jeffersonian proposition is that ‘widespread poverty and concentrated wealth cannot exist side by side in a democracy.""* Now, Chomsky being critical of capitalism throughout the book means that he has incentives to overplay Jefferson's anti-capitalist tendencies, but nonetheless, I find the second part of the statement, about ""widespread poverty and concentrated wealth"", to be consistent with every source I have read. Also, obviously, he is a prolific historian. Since Jefferson was the leader of the party, it would be safe to at least assume that a large contingent of the Dem-Reps would have similar misgivings to one of the fundamental hallmarks of modern American capitalism. Also notable are his opposition to creating a Central Bank and providing sources of reliable credit. 

Feel free to contest anything above: after all, I'm neither American (im indian) nor a historian (C++ programmer). 

Also, two more things that I would like to reiterate that others have said:

u/fearofair and u/AffixBayonets mentioned that I didn't talk about centralization of government and the strength of the Federal Government in my answer. Sorry, I was just tired and forgot! Of course, one of **the most** important points in the struggle of the First Party System (possibly even more important than the agrarian-industrial dynamic I mentioned) was the fact that the Federalists supported a strong central government, whereas the Republicans supported as limited of a federal government as the Constitution would allow. That also wasn't great for Hamilton, since he was alive at a time when American libertarianism was perhaps at an all-time high, and his pro-government sympathies won him much scorn. 

u/PhD-Holder-Nordic also mentioned something super-important: Hamilton's personality itself. He could certainly charm the right people, no doubt, and he had a youthful vigor to him during the years of the Revolution, and he was widely recognized as being prodigal, but he had a condescending way of speaking to others which made him disliked. Add a certain absolutism, brashness, and an unwillingness to compromise, and you get a person who was disliked by many not because of his policies but because of his demeanor."
AskHistorians,"I’m from Aruba, small island in the Caribbean. My grandparents always told me they had to switch off their lights at night during WW2 to not be spotted by German aircraft. How is this possible if Germany never sent its aircraft carriers to the Caribbean?","While there were no aircraft attacks on Aruba during the war, there was noteworthy German submarine activity in the area due to Aruba being a vital oil producer for the Allied powers. Most notably on February 16, 1942, when a combined U-boat and Italian submarine wolfpack under the command of Werner Hartenstein in *U-156* attacked the oil tankers and refineries at San Nicholas Harbor, Eagle Beach, and Willemstad Harbor, sinking six tankers and damaging a further two. One source I found noted that some Arubans turned on their lights and drove to the coast, to try and see what was going on. 

In nighttime actions at sea, any light sorces are something that can be used to the attacker's advantage. A submarine could spot and attack a ship much easier and more successfully if the ship was sillouetted against a brightly lit-up island, for instance. There's also the danger of shore bombardment from the sub's deck guns, which could be much more accurately fired at a light source. *U-156* herself was going to shell the Lago Refinery, which was a perfectly lit target, but fortunately her crew forgot to remove the plug from her 105mm deck gun, and the first shot rendered the gun inoperable for the time being. It was attempted to use the 37mm AA gun, but that proved ineffective.

This attack exposed how vulnerable Aruba was and how important it was that their crucial oil infrastructure remained functional, and afterwards, the island was ordered to completely black out for the remainder of the war. Why your grandparents thought that was a precaution against aircraft, I can't say. Maybe that was one of the justifications given thanks to either propaganda or just the fog of war, maybe it was rumor or gossip that spread, maybe they just misremembered it. But yes, Aruba did observe nighttime blackout protocols during WWII."
AskHistorians,Silence Is Oppression Too: A History Of Indigenous Resistance Against State Violence,"In 1854, the small Ponca tribe (who were close with the Omaha tribe) were granted a small, 70mi strip of land between the Aowa Creek and the Niobara river, a claim that they would share with the Omaha tribe. This small patch of land, shared with the Omaha, would become a touch stone for one of the first judicial victories for Native Americans in US Court.

The Ponca tribe, like many Plains tribes, survived on a mix of agriculture and hunting. As American settlers moved west and disrupted both agriculture and hunting areas, the Plains tribes came into more and more conflict. In the case of the Ponca, raiding increased between the Brulé and Ogala Lakota and the Pawnee, Omaha, and Ponca. This created even more hardship on top of the fact that all the tribes had been decimated by smallpox. The Ponca began to rely more and more on agriculture.

The Ponca began to work their new land, but the United States failed to keep their promises to build mills and provide protection or schooling. The land was considered barely adequate, and the Ponca requested better land. In a rare victory for a tribe, the United States acquiesced and allowed the Ponca to return to their homeland in 1865.

...and then promptly gave it to the Sankee Dakota in the Treaty of Laramie (1868), in the aftermath of Red Cloud's War. To fix their mistake, the Federal Government ~~worked diligently to help the Ponca~~ removed the Ponca to the Indian Territory.

In preparation for removal, the United States took Ponca chiefs (including Standing Bear) to the Indian Territory to finalize a site where they would move. This confused and angered the Ponca chiefs, because they believed that the agreement was to move them to the Omaha reservation back in Nebraska, and was an obvious violation of their agreements with the United States. Inspector Edward C. Kimble showed the chiefs the Osage and Kaw reservations, which the Ponca were flatly not interested in. Rather than continue to look at the Quapaw reservation they also had no intention of moving to, the Ponca walked home, and Kimble selected the Quapaw Reservation as the Ponca's new home, where they were forcibly moved in late 1877.

In a familiar tale, the Ponca were removed to Oklahoma too late to plant, and the government failed to provide assistance, leading over a third of the tribe to die from starvation and disease, incloding Standing Bear's son, Bear Shield.

Standing Bear had promised to take his son home to their homeland on the Niobara, and so, in the Spring of 1878, with 30 followers, he took his son's body north to their old homeland and to the Omaha Reservation. The Omaha greeted them warmly, and the United States ~~took pity on Standing Bear~~ sent General George Crook to arrest Standing Bear and send him home.

George Crook was famous for fighting Native tribes in the west, so it would seem odd that Crook took pity on Standing Bear, but he had long gained a reputation for fairness and honesty. He told local journalist Thomas Tibbles about the Ponca, and Tibbles publicized Standing Bear's plight and helped secure representation by talking to John Webster and Andrew Poppleton (chief attorney for Union Pacific).

Webster and Poppleton immediately filed a *habeas corpus* action in Federal court, forcing Crook (as the defendant holding Standing Bear) to state a cause of action for holding him. The policy of the United States was that **Standing Bear was neither a citizen nor a person under the law**, and therefore had no rights of *habeas corpus*. Standing Bear caught a huge break here, as Crook was sympathetic to Standing Bear, and he had excellent legal representation.

One aspect of the case considered unusual at the time was Standing Bear taking the stand to make his own remarks (through an interpreter, Susette LaFlesche). Thomas Tibbles [recounted his full speech here](https://library.timelesstruths.org/texts/Stories_Worth_Rereading/Standing_Bears_Speech/), but the beginning of that speech has been memorialized at the wall behind Standing Bear's statue at the Centennial Mall in Lincoln, NE.

>Standing Bear arose. Half facing the audience, he held out his right hand, and stood motionless so long that the stillness of death which had settled down on the audience, became almost unbearable. At last, looking up at the judge, he said:  
>  
>“That hand is not the color of yours, but if I prick it, the blood will flow, and I shall feel pain. The blood is of the same color as yours. God made me, and I am a man. I never committed any crime. If I had, I would not stand here to make a defense. I would suffer the punishment and make no complaint.”

[Judge Elmer Dundy ruled that Standing Bear](https://casetext.com/case/us-ex-rel-standing-bear-v-crook) was, in fact, a person, which was a landmark ruling in Indian Law.

>""The right of expatriation is a natural, inherent and inalienable right and extends to the Indian as well as to the more fortunate white race,""

The Army immediately released the Ponca, who were allowed to return to their lands on the Niobara. The Hayes Administration finalized the move.

Through the columns in the Omaha Herald, Standing Bear had become a minor celebrity in Omaha, and embarked on a speaking tour in the East to speak on Indian rights. He later returned home to farm before joining Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. He has since been memorialized in Nebraska and Oklahoma, has a statue in Statuary Hall at the US Congress, and this year was honored with a postage stamp.

AskHistorians,"Did people in the old west really wear so many layers and warm clothing, if so, why?","Yes. Most people wore several layers of clothing, but they're likely not nearly as heavy or hot as you think they are. The materials would have been all natural fibers; cotton, linen, wool. All of them could be milled as either very light, fine, almost gossamer material *or* on the other extreme, very thick, heavy material. Clothing would also have been made with certain uses in mind, and thicker, heavier clothes were generally more suited to winter wear or as work wear - think of the thick cotton duck or denim that makes heavy work overalls - and your daily wear would have been made of a thickness suited to the weather and time of year.

In general, even in summer, and even in a hot place like Tombstone, a man would wear underwear of light cotton - a ""union suit"" or a pair of drawers - with a cotton or linen shirt over top, a pair of trousers - probably of wool or a work-appropriate cotton canvas - and a wool, cotton, or linen jacket. They might also wear a neckcloth with a collar, which would either be removable (a ""white collar, made of white linen and stiffened to stand tall on the neck) or not (""blue collar"" from the ubiquitous blue wool overshirts that were popular work wear). Topped with a hat, of course.

Covering one's whole body was important because, especially in Arizona, it was far more important to keep the sun off you than it was to not be mildly hot. And again, if you had suitable clothes, linen, cotton, and wool are all breathable and comfortable, and someone wearing head to toe wool would likely be a lot more comfortable in the sun than someone today wearing jeans and a polyester windbreaker. Polyester and synthetic fabrics in general are not great at breathing and tend to hold on to moisture, unless they're designed to be not that way. Combining cotton - which does retain moisture - with linen or wool - which tend to wick moisture away - you can get sort of the best of both worlds; your cotton undershirt would keep sweat and your body's filth away from your more expensive outer clothing, and the outer clothing would allow wind to cut through and keep one cool, all while keeping the sun from your skin.

In *Tombstone*, you're likely also seeing ""dusters,"" which were work coats worn by cowboys, because cow herds stirred up tremendous amounts of dust. The duster's purpose was to keep your clothes clean and freer of dust than otherwise, and if it made one hot, then that was a sacrifice that people were more than capable of dealing with. *More specifically* about *Tombstone*, the iconic scene with the Earps and co. confronting the cowboys, and only Wyatt and Doc Holiday are wearing longer coats than normal, and Doc Holliday is wearing a cloak because he's dying of tuberculosis. They are also trying to conceal their weapons as they walked down the street. It wasn't because people regularly wore long heavy dusters in town.

But tl;dr, yes people layered in the 19th century. It is likely far more comfortable than you imagine, because natural fibers have qualities that many folks are less aware of today because the majority of our modern clothing is made of polyester blend material, which interferes with the natural fibers' qualities.

There isn't much written about things like this, but I've spent quite a few years as a historical interpreter at a historic site, where I had to wear head-to-toe wool on hot summer days, and I was about as comfortable as you could be if your job is to stand in the sun all day and talk to folks about history. I answered ""aren't you hot in that"" about ten thousand times a day. The answer is usually ""of course I am, it's 90 degrees out."" But that has less to do with the clothes than you might expect."

AskHistorians,Did ancient Greeks actually wear breastplates with muscles molded on?,"The helpful /u/Blindghost01 has already linked [my answer to a similar question from 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/456upp/how_effective_were_muscle_breastplates_were_they/). But since your thread is getting some attention, I thought I'd pop in and elaborate on some of the additional questions.

First of all, yes, this type of armour was real and is well-attested both iconographically (on vases and statues) and archaeologically (actual pieces of armour). There are surviving examples in many museums; they are found on sites from all over the ancient Greek world, including some very fine examples from Southern Italy.

The muscle cuirass probably represents the convergence of two important goals of armour design: looking intimidating and providing a snug and comfortable fit. The goal of intimidation was met by a design that showed idealised, godlike anatomical features in flashing bronze. The goal of a good fit was met by armour that matched the body underneath as closely as possible without obstructing movement. Of course, most wearers of the muscle cuirass wouldn't actually have had these ideal torsos with chiseled abs, but it would have taken little effort to work up the basic outline and proportions of the body into those idealised features. The wearer certainly would have wanted friends and enemies to believe that the cuirass reflected their physical form and fit them like a second skin. Meanwhile the simple design of this cuirass - a short moulded chestplate and back-plate linked together with hinges down the flank - left the neck, arms and legs completely free. It was a very effective compromise between protection and mobility that wasn't really outclassed until the spread of mail shirts in the last century or so BC.

We have no reason to believe this armour was ceremonial to the Greeks. In fact we do not know of any ""purely ceremonial"" Greek arms or armour. There is often a debate over seemingly impractical pieces of ancient armour and whether they might have been intended only for display, but our sources actually stress the importance of imposing display *in battle*. Pitched battle hinged on morale and any tactic that might scare or intimidate the enemy could be decisive. It doesn't seem very likely, then, that flashy armour would have been used only for religious processions or reviews.

As to how common they were, that is a much harder question to answer. Greek warriors provided their own equipment, so we do not have anything like a quartermaster's inventory that might tell us how many pieces of what gear would be available to an army of a given size. It is commonly assumed that the muscle cuirass would be the most expensive type of armour (where organic armour, like the linen cuirass, may have been more affordable), and therefore available only to the wealthy few. Eero Jarva's survey of the armour dedicated at Olympia found only one bronze cuirass for every 10 helmets. But there are all sorts of reasons why we cannot necessarily take this as a rule of thumb, including the distorting effects of dedication as a process, the survival of pieces in the record, the decay of other materials from which cuirasses might be made, and most importantly, change over time. Dedications of armour at Olympia stop being made right around [the start of an apparent trend toward lightening of the panoply](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5tvsl6/a_question_on_armor_in_the_late_archaicearly/ddpnaqs/), meaning that fewer and fewer Greek heavy infantry fighters were using any body armour at all. The muscle cuirass certainly did not go away, but the number of men wearing one into battle may well have gone down in no clear relation to the number of men who could *afford* to wear one. We should probably imagine few of the men in any Classical Greek army - and mostly concentrated among the commanders and the cavalry - wearing comprehensive body armour of this kind."

AskHistorians,"My grandmother was taught in 1950s secretarial school to ""always keep a desk between you and your boss."" How did physically harassing/groping middle class female subordinates as part of mainstream office culture become so widely acceptable?","The idea that women in work was associated with sexuality appeared quite early; essentially, right at
the start of factory work. There was a direct connection made between the woman working outside of a family
unit and the onset of ""low morals"". The logic was sometimes made because of pay; an essay contest from 1829
gave as a subject the ""inadequacy"" of wages of ""seamstresses, spoolers, spinners, shoe binders, etc."" and how these
""forced poor women to the choice between dishonor and absolute want of common necessaries"". Alternately, the
logic was that the women were outside the protection of men and thus vulnerable. One story about the Lowell mill
was about men called the ""Old Line"" who had an ""understanding"" with the factory workers (this story was denied
by the women, but nonetheless the reputation remained).

Part of the issue here is the asymmetry of power. Yes, a woman could be ""ruined"" by ""loose morals"", but a man involved was not equally ruined; if anything it was the woman's fault, somehow. ""Rape"" was something done by a stranger (this required petitioning by women's rights groups through the late 19th century to change). This was added to the implication that -- in the ""respectable"", ""non-respectable"" divide -- by entering the workplace a woman was automatically ""non-respectable"" and hence responsible for bringing any ill treatment on themselves.

In 1908, _Harper's Bazaar_ [printed some letters](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Harper_s_Bazaar/rNkjAQAAMAAJ) from working women, with a column entitled _The Girl Who Comes to the City_. One stenographer
moved to New York and gave her experiences going through newspaper ads looking for a job. The first she found was for a lawyer who wanted to pay six dollars a week:

>I asked him if he thought a young lady could live in New York on that, and clothe herself. He said he expected young women had friends who helped them out. I was too indignant to speak for a moment...

The lawyer, straightforwardly, and immediately upon offering the job, was proposing that she ask men for money in exchange for favors. On her next day of job-searching, she answered one from a doctor:

>The first ""ad"" I answered the second day was that of a doctor who desired a stenographer at once, good wages paid. It sounded rather well, I  thought,  and I felt that this time I  would meet a gentleman. The doctor was very kind and seemed to like my appearance and references; as to salary, he offered me S15 a week, with a speedy prospect of more. As I was leaving his office, feeling that at last I was launched safely upon the road to a good living, he said casually, ""Ί have an auto; and as my wife doesn't care for  that sort of thing, I shall expect you to accompany me frequently on pleasure trips."" That settled the doctor; I never appeared.

We have records of ""stolen embraces, pinches, and vulgar remarks"". One woman from that era  (Elizabeth Hasanovitch) was so afraid after an attempted rape from her boss she avoided picking up her last paycheck. A 13-year old records being propositioned by her boss:

>Come, Ruth, sit down here. He motioned to his knee. I felt my face flush. I backed away towards the door and stood staring at him.

A Young Ladies Educational Society was formed in 1914 specifically for resisting sexual advances from employers. A member of the society wrote

>Once he touched me, very fresh like, and I cried, and he said, ""Let's be good friends, Rosie, and to show you how good I means it, you take supper mit me in a swell hotel, with music and flowers, see?""

With the level of silence going on it is hard to quantify how bad the issue was. A 1888 report on New York working conditions from the Department of the Interior identified simply that conditions ""vary with the character of the occupation"" and ""the interest the proprietor takes in his employees"" but quite specifically calls men and women working together to be the problem: ""Whenever the sexes work indiscriminately together great laxity obtains.""

Pauline Newman, an organizer for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), reporting about a factory owner's son and superintendent preying on women, wrote

>There is not a factory today where the same immoral conditions do not exist...

so at the very least, we can conclude that sexual harassment of women was not a unique problem to the 1950s, that is

>a 19th century man casually patting a female professional worker under his employ on the rear end and not provoking comment at least

was not just imaginable but common. So the answer to your question is that the behavior did not ""become"" acceptable, it was always a part of the experience of women in the workplace, just it only got a more public airing starting in the 1950s and 1960s, up to the point that [a hit musical could have a number about how ""A Secretary is Not a Toy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uETwKF_fgKw&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqq2oSHkvlZNslnAglPvJJF1&index=5).

Of course, awareness eventually (belatedly) leads to action. The musical referenced above (_How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying_) is from 1961. 1964 saw Title VII, from the Civil Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin, reducing one of the tools of workplace sexism. While that hardly solved the entire issue (see my [recent post about women trying to get loans and bank accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/158nbyy/could_women_open_a_bank_account_in_the_us_in_the/jtdvog8/)) it was one step to repairing the fabric of society.

AskHistorians,"Alchemy famously sought to turn lead into gold. But why lead? Out of all the different metals, why was there such a focus on lead?","I'm going to make a good-faith effort to answer this question to the best of my ability and knowledge, but understand that the topic of alchemy is esoteric, obfuscated, and extremely inconsistent between sources.

Primary sources can be found, but speaking as someone who has studied them directly, I will counsel you that they may raise more questions than they answer; alchemical texts are notoriously difficult to decipher, and many were written this way purposefully. For the curious, though, I will be referencing several texts which can be accessed from this website:

[https://www.alchemywebsite.com/texts.html](https://www.alchemywebsite.com/texts.html)

I know, it's a sketchy website - but as I will touch on shortly, the entire study of alchemy is itself filled with dubious scholarship, so I think this is entirely in keeping. These texts are directly cited, and this particular repository is fairly extensive, so if you \*really\* want to see what English-speaking alchemists thought, go forth and read.

I will also stipulate one final thing: alchemical transmutation has been thoroughly debunked by modern science. It does not work, and while several of these texts give various methods that one could reproduce, I strenuously advise against attempting any of them. Boiling mercury is not conducive to healthy living.

\---

To start, let's talk a little about what alchemy is, and what different alchemists were trying to achieve.

**Alchemists and their Beliefs**

Broadly speaking, alchemical writings are not just concerned with the manipulation of physical matter; rather, alchemy can be viewed as a philosophy that synthesizes chemistry and spirituality. A common overarching idea is that transmuting materials is directly analogous to the purification of the soul - alchemists were, in general, trying to advance \*spiritual\* enlightenment as well as \*intellectual\* enlightenment. It's important to understand this mindset in order to grasp what they were trying to achieve with metallurgy.

The earliest surviving alchemical texts are those of Zosimos of Panopolis. Zosimos was a Gnostic mystic who compiled earlier Hellenistic writings on alchemy, and his works would influence later medieval alchemists (particularly during the Golden Age of Islam).

The surviving works of Zosimos are [compiled in French](https://remacle.org/bloodwolf/alchimie/alchimieIII.htm) (Google translate will get you pretty far here if you don't read it), so again, you can read them directly. He gives several techniques that involve reacting lead, but he also talked about transmuting *other* metals to gold (quoted from \*The True Book of Sophe\*):

>As the sun is, so to speak, a flower of the fire and (simultaneously) the heavenly sun, the right eye of the world, so copper when it blooms—that is when it takes the color of gold, through purification—becomes a terrestrial sun, which is king of the earth, as the sun is king of heaven.

Another major alchemist of the ancient world was Jābir ibn Ḥayyān, whose works were studied by noted scholar Paul Kraus.

ibn Ḥayyān is noteworthy for providing the first method of classifying substances (using the descriptors ""hot,"" ""cold,"" ""wet,"" and ""dry,"" a classification scheme which would later form the basis for humoral theory in the middle ages), and for arguing that sulphur and mercury were the fundamental mineral and metal respectively, and from them all other substances were derived. He argued that by altering the properties of a substance, you could transmute it, and that the Philosopher's Stone was the catalyst needed to facilitate this.

There are much later writings too numerous to list out, but a couple of noteworthy ones:

\-The [Rosarium philosophorum](https://www.alchemywebsite.com/rosary0.html) is a ""survey"" style work discussing specific philosophies of various alchemists through history; it provides an overview of the sheer amount of variation in alchemical approaches

\-[The Crowning of Nature](https://www.alchemywebsite.com/crowning.html) is a compilation discussing and compiling earlier alchemical writings, and making them more accessible

\-John French's *Art of Distillation* includes a section on the [nature of gold and silver](https://www.alchemywebsite.com/jfren_6.html), which is...obtuse, to say the least. He describes the way in which the 4 elements conjoin and then create sperm with the blessing of God, and then enter the earth and produce a vapor (which he seems to relate to the Philosopher's Stone), and that vapor can transmute the earth into different metals (silver, tin, copper, or gold) depending on where it passes through.

\-Sir Francis Bacon has a few alchemical treatises, including one explicitly about [making gold](https://www.alchemywebsite.com/bacongld.html), his method for which involves melting silver along with mercury and nitre:

>For the Materiall, take *Silver*, which is the *Metall* that in Nature Symbolizeth most with *Gold*; Put in also, with the *Silver*, a Tenth Part of *Quick-silver*, and Twelfth Part of *Nitre*, by weight

I could go on but there's no point. One can peruse these works and in doing so, you will find very little commonality in methods - this is to be expected since, as I said in the preface, none of these techniques \*actually work.\* The main take-away from perusing these sources is that no two ancient alchemists really had the same approach, the same goals, or even thought the same things about various metals. Many engaged in circular references, and most deliberately obfuscated their material in order to protect the specific author's interpretation; it was less about genuine scholarship and more about making a name for oneself.

So, the first and pithy answer to the question ""why did they focus on lead so much"" is that they *didn't* \- actual alchemists were concerned with transmuting a number of substances to gold, as part of pursuing spiritual advancement.

\---

But that doesn't really answer the problem, because we popularly *do* associate alchemy with transmuting lead *specifically*, and so the question still remains: why lead?

I will elaborate on that in the reply."
AskHistorians,Could Romulus and Remus simply be stand ins for two early settlements that had been growing on the banks of the Tiber in the 8th century BCE? Or do Historians think that they might have actually been real figures?,"Most historians consider Romulus and Remus to be completely fictional. While Andrea Carandini argues for the authenticity of Rome's foundation myth, most historians reject his hypothesis.

Ancient people's often attributed city foundations to ""nomative founders"", an individual who would intentionally found a city and name it after themselves. Real life examples of cities named after ""founders"" this do exist, like any of the cities named after Alexander the Great, Phillip II, or any of the Roman emperors, but this is not likely to be true of Rome.

Excavations have found evidence of settlement from the Middle and Recent Bronze Age, with more stable and permanent settlements dating to the seventeenth and tenth centuries BC. Signs of settlements are found at the Forum Boarium, and the Capitoline Hill, with cemeteries on the Esquiline and in the Forum Romanum. What is unclear is whether these settlements were unified or separate. Carandini identifies the area as the *Septimontium*, which the ancient antiquarian Varro says was the original name of the site of Rome. If true, then this settlement would have covered some 150 hectares, encompassing the Capitoline, Esquiline, Palatine, Quirinal, and Forum. Caution must be observed, however, as such large, unified settlements were uncommon for the Bronze Age, and it is better to view the settlements as separate communities covering the area. What the evidence shows is that Rome was not founded all at once, as claimed in the annalistic tradition, but rather was the unification of several communities in the area.

Returning to Romulus and Remus, there is much to be said. Our evidence for Romulus begins in the 300's BC, with the setting up of a statue of the twins being suckled by the wolf by the Ogulnii, curule *aediles* for the year 296. The name Romulus can be understood as ""the Roman"", and Remus is likely to be a ""corruption"" of the name the Greeks gave to Rome's founder, Rhomos. The story of Romulus was a version of a common Mediterranean and near-eastern folk tale, paralleled by Aegisthus, Phylacides and Philander, Cydon (raised by wild animals) or Telephus and Perseus (mothers raped by gods).

Romulus and Remus are not the only proposed founders of Rome. The Mediterranean Bronze Age was a time of great cultural fusion, and it is unsurprising that there are so many variants. Guy Bradley provides a helpful chart (Table 3.1) in his *Early Rome to 290 BC*, listing such founders as Aeneas and Odysseus, the Palasgians, and the Achaeans. There exist as well variants for how Rome got it's name, like being named after the Trojan woman Rhoma. Parallels to nomative founders like Romulus can be found in Capys of Capua and Amirus of Ameria. 

So, if Romulus is a version of a common folk tale, then what specifically is Remus? Wiseman argues that Remus was added to the myth in the third century BC to represent the so-called ""Struggle of the Orders"". Remus was killed after the orders reconciled, no longer being a necessary figure. Wiseman also suggests that Remus was supposed to represent human sacrifice, meant to ensure Rome's invincibility. If Wiseman is correct about Remus' late insertion to the myth, then it would have happened around the time of the battle of Sentinum, where the Romans resorted to human sacrifice. That the battle was won after the death of one of the two consuls reinforces his hypothesis.

While I could go on, I think what I've provided shows that Romulus and Remus were born out of their wider Mediterranean context, and are not even specifically ""Roman."" Romulus has strong ties to the city of Alba Longa, and he appears in iconographic representations throughout central Italy. Romulus and Remus are not historical figures, but are part a wide, cultural patchwork of mythology that evolved through the telling and retelling over the course of centuries.

**Edit:** Accidentally implied there was human habitation on the site of Rome 102,000 years ago. Emphatically, there was *not*. Also some spelling, grammar, and minor rewording to avoid confusion.

AskHistorians,"""Moby Dick"" describes a whaling voyage where the captain remains shut in below deck while the ship departs, and most crew members only meet him several days into the voyage. Is this even remotely realistic?","It actually is possible, especially as to a green hand like Ishmael, which is perhaps unsurprising as Melville based several of his novels, including *Moby Dick*, on his life experience as a green hand in the whalefleet.[1] 

A whaling ship[2] is a significant capital investment. A whaling ship could be owned by a single wealthy merchant, or owned by a group, legally a partnership, of successful merchants. The number of partners would vary, from two to a half-dozen or so. Sometimes a successful whaling captain would join a partnership and then captain a vessel that he (part-) owned, but usually the owner or consortium of owners would hire a captain that they trusted, and then the rest of the crew would be hired by an agent that worked for the ship owner(s). Experienced crew would want to know who the captain was before they signed on, as a captain's reputation proceeds him. Even if the captain was on his first voyage as captain, he already had a reputation from his time as a mate. Whaling captains and whaling crew all lived in the same communities, so any experienced whaler would have met his future captain in church, in the town militia, in the shops and stores, and so forth. But Ishmael is specifically from out of town, and nearly immediately signs on to a ship once he gets in Nantucket, so it's quite understandable that he hadn't met the captain socially prior to the voyage. His friend the ""harpooner""[3] Queequeg, though, would likely have heard something about every captain in the region, including Ahab.

While the captain could take personal charge of the vessel when leaving port, he was under no obligation to do so; that sort of routine seamanship was well within the capabilities of the mates.

And the scene in the book when Ahab comes out and gives a big speech to the crew, when he declares that they're going to hunt the white whale, and there's cheering and whatnot? That was accurate too, at least the speech part! It was tradition that once the ship was out of sight of land, all hands would be called the the quarterdeck, and the captain would deliver a ""Harangue"". (The word didn't have a negative connotation in the 1800s.) The captain would address the crew and tell them the general plan for the voyage, including expected stops on the way and where they hoped to catch whales, and he would encourage them to work hard with tales of the riches they would gain.[4] My impression is that it served the same purpose as a locker-room speech-- the captain is trying to bond the crew together, create loyalty to the officers, and inspire everyone to perform well.

So is it realistic? No, in that most crew members would have met the captain in ordinary social situations in their home port. But for a green hand, new in town, it's quite possible he would first lay eyes on the captain when the ship was a dozen miles offshore and the captain called the crew together to deliver his harangue. 

[1] Technically Melville sailed on three different whaling ships- he signed on to the *Acushnet* in New Bedford, ""jumped ship"" in the South Pacific, but was eventually picked up by the *Lucy Ann*. He never officially signed on to the second ship but one assumes they made him work for his passage, which ended with him in jail. Once out of jail, he signed on the *Charles & Henry* for his third and final experience of whaling.

[2] I'll call all whaling vessels ""ships"", but at the time they were distinguished by a more specific name that referred to their sail plan (the arraingement of masts and sails)-- so one might sail on a whaling sloop, a whaling brig, or a whaling ship, but anyone that called a whaling sloop a whaling ship was a landlubber not worthy of attention.

[3] American whalers didn't use ""harpooner"" as a title. The position was actually called ""boatsteerer"" as they would be directing one of the small whaleboats that where launched from the whaling ship to do the actual harpooning. They were not officers, though, in that they didn't command the larger vessel and were not trained in the vital officers' skill of celestial navigation. I suspect Melville used ""harpooner"" because it's a much more exciting word than ""boatsteerer"", but that's a literary analysis question, not a historical one.

[4] Whaling crew were unusual in that they were not paid a salary. Instead every sailor, from the captain down, contracted for a ""lay"" which was a portion of the voyage's net ~~income~~ revenue (not profit!), with the only expense to be subtracted that of shipping home oil, which would only happen if the ship was so successful its own hold was full. Looking at an example before me ([the 1873 voyage of the bark *Matilda Sears*](https://whalinghistory.org/?s=AV09438)), the captain had a lay of 1/16, four ""ordinary seaman"" got 1/185 each, the cook got 1/160, the ship's boy received 1/300 *etc.* There were twenty-six crew in total, and collectively the entire crews' lays sum to 30.15% of the revenue, with the rest going to the ship's owners, out of which they'd have to pay for all the supplies and repairs.

EDIT: Removed a few typos & expanded slightly on the lays."

The tl;dr is that it's an incredibly complex question but also, in some ways, a meaningless question because sex, sexuality, sexual behaviour, class and gender roles are huge interlinked concepts and you can't really think about part of it without thinking about all of it. Anybody who tells you that Ancient Greece was a pan-LGBT utopia is wrong, but anybody who tries to imply that attitudes to sexuality in Ancient Greece remotely resembled modern homophobia is also wrong."
AskHistorians,Why was Pakistan defeated so quickly in its 1971 war with India?,"The answer here is geographic and demographic more than anything else. I want to caveat here that I'm Indian, and far from impartial. I'm going to try and limit myself to what I understand to be the basic facts here, but someone with a Pakistani and a Bangladeshi perspective may wish to chime in as well and offer more nuance.

Broadly speaking the issue the Pakistani army faced boiled down to the fact that East Pakistan was completely separated geographically from West Pakistan. What is today Bangladesh had no territory that was contiguous with what is today Pakistan (and was then West Pakistan). This meant that once hostilities broke out, they had no effective way to resupply.

On its own this might not have been an issue, but the demographic divide between West and East Pakistan matter here. And the political history is important too. East Pakistan was largely Bengali. West Pakistan was not. Prior to the events of 1971 and as a result of the political movements in the East unifying under the Awami League and Mujibur Rehman, the 1970 election had created a situation where the East Pakistani party could form the government.

This was not a particularly popular outcome in West Pakistan however, which contributed to the growing breakdown between the Western and Eastern portions. I'm not going to try and pretend to do justice to the complicated political history here. But the long and short of it is that West Pakistani leaders were extremely unhappy about ceding power to East Pakistani leaders. This led to disaffection and growing violence in the east, which India also contributed to.

West Pakistani leaders, using the army (which was dominated by demographics from the West) sought to suppress this growing unhappiness. This culminated in the events that many have described as a genocide of Bengalis in 1971.

So once war broke out, the Pakistani Army in the East could not resupply, and enjoyed little to no popular support. Its not clear how they could have continued any sort of detailed resistance without either of these, thus leading to the relatively quick cessation of hostilities. There are other elements to this story, such as Pakistan's inability to muster adequate international support against India in response to the war. While the US did intervene and was sailing a carrier group up the Bay of Bengal, its not clear if they would have been actively willing to bomb Indian forces. Moreover they certainly weren't willing to mount the sort of assistance the forces in East Pakistan needed to effectively muster opposition to the Indian Army.

Two sources I'm largely drawing on (beyond the more amorphous learned history you pick up generally) and would recommend are

*1971 A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh* by Srinath Raghavan

*The People Next Door* by T.C.A Raghavan

They're both, AFAIK, Indian authors, but Srinath Raghavan's book is published by Harvard University Press, T.C.A Raghavan's by Oxford University Press, so perhaps not as partisan. I am not personally familiar with Pakistani or Bangladeshi authors on the subject, so I'd encourage you to try and find some books by them too. I want to again stress that I'm sure there's partisan issues in the way I've portrayed this history, and nuances I've doubtless failed to do justice to. 

But I believe gist of my answer should be correct, which is that the Pakistani army surrendered because of supply issues and the fact that they were seeking to hold a country that was deeply hostile to them."
AskHistorians,"American Gods (TV Show) contains a scene depicting two Nordic men conducting a human sacrifice in Wisconsin in 1690. How likely is this event, or any other version, to have taken place in North America?","While u/Steelcan909's answer is a good primer on the contexts of Old Norse religion and its collapse, I want to directly answer each of your four questions.

1. By the 17th century, there's nothing that even vaguely resembles active practice of Old Norse religion. Even if it had survived longer than the 11th century, I would find it unlikely that anything would have survived the Reformation. We can use Saami cultural practices as an analogue here; the 17th century represents a massive incursion of Lutheran missionaries and Swedish government officials into the Sapmi, and the heavy taxation and criminalization of traditional Saami religious practices. Even though the 1600s is also the period when Old Norse literature becomes popular in Scandinavia, particularly to ""answer"" disputes about which Scandinavian country was older, the interest in this collecting is avowedly not the pre-Christian beliefs, but rather the territorial expansion of early kings. This aggressively Lutheran, nationalist fervor is the cultural milieu we should imagine for 17th century Swedes, not a sort of timeless sort-of-paganism.
2. I think Steelcan answered this one well enough - a pair of trappers in pre-Christian Sweden would have worshipped something related to the gods as we understand them, but since there isn't a single unified pantheon or religious practice, there's nothing to guarantee that their worship of Freyr, or Ullr, or elves, or whoever bears much resemblance to the descriptions of rituals provided by Adam of Bremen or Ari Thorgilsson.
3. I.. don't actually know. My instinct would certainly be that it is possible, but I'm going to specifically invite any early modernists or specialists in French colonial policy to chime in here. I've not been able to find anything definitive about whether they'd legally be allowed to operate. That being said, the show appears to imply less that these are recent Swedish migrants, and more that these are descendants of the Vinland settlers who have, over time, moved to the Upper Midwest. In short, it's drawing on a narrative that became super popular in the late 1800s, and we was reflected in hoaxes like the ""Kensington Runestone."" There is, it must be stressed, absolutely zero credible evidence that anyone of European origin made it to the Upper Midwest anytime prior to early modern colonialism, and the assertion that there had been is tied up in several different threads of xenophobic, anti-indigenous, and pseudoscientific discourse that were circulating in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
4. On that note, the Vinland settlers were almost all Christians, according to our two saga about the settlement (which are derived from independent oral traditions in Greenland, but are both in lots of ways unreliable). The one pagan on Thorfinnr Karlsefni's voyage, according to *The Saga of Erik the Red*, 1) summoned a cursed whale that made everyone sick, 2) refused to accept Thorfinnr as leader, 3) got caught in a storm that separated his boat from the rest in the voyage, 4) got blown all the way to Ireland where his boat was chewed through by sea-worms, and 5) got executed by the Irish. Oh yeah, and he worshiped Thor, not Odin. So.... to put it mildly, the sources we have for Vinland are staunchly anti-pagan, making the show's premise entirely implausible if it was trying at all to stick to our surviving evidence."
AskHistorians,"If you were enlisted in World War 1 in 1914 on the Western Front, how likely were you to survive to the end of the war?","There is a particular difficulty in your question as posed since it contemplates a soldier’s odds of surviving the entirety of the war. That can’t really be answered as such because the variables of the individual soldiers, units, battles, etc. preclude abstracting survival “odds” to anything very concrete. Some battles had astounding casualty rates (which includes killed and injured). Some soldiers were not active combatants, or were posted away from most of the danger. (World War I exhibited the phenomenon of “fronts” that were not exceedingly dynamic or porous as they would be later; you could take a leave and be comfortable once you were out of artillery range.)

Averaged over the period from August 1914 through November 1918, and not including deaths in prisoner of war camps, historians Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker determined in their work “Understanding the Great War” an approximate rate of attrition at 900 and 1300 soldiers per day for the French and Germans, respectively. These are very rough figures, as are most from the period. Pulling a quick reference from the Encyclopedia Brittanica, the total forces under arms at the outset of war in August 1914 stood at about 1.3 million for the French and 1.9 million for the Germans. 

If we focus on the French military to keep it largely limited to the Western front, and also assuming that this person was already enlisted at the outbreak of the war (so we can simplify the rate of change in personnel with mass mobilization), and further assuming the necessary fictions that rates of attrition were equally spread across all French combatants under arms at the outset of war—and lastly assuming my napkin math applied to this scenario is correct—France could expect that half of those initial combatants (if none were wounded, only either active or killed) would be killed by August 1916, and all by August 1918.

Of course, these final figures are such abstractions that they sound ridiculous due to the assumptions necessary to reduce a lived-in life of a solider to an abstracted chance of survival. In the end, the figures that make up this thought experiment can be somewhat illuminating, but I don’t think it’s possible to answer this question in both a numerical and satisfactory way. 

Taking peak French forces of about 8,800,00 and about 1,360,000 deaths (again, rough numbers from Encyclopedia Britannica) we can say that between one in six and one in seven persons who served in the French army during World War I would ultimately die in the conflict. These are just slightly better odds than Russian roulette."

AskHistorians,"When it came time to compile the Quran, what was the argument to arrange the chapters by length? Why not chronologically?","I will be answering from Islamic sources. 

The Quran was not revealed chapter by chapter but by groupings of verses. For example the first revelation was only the first 5 verses of *Surah Alaq*, A *surah* that has 19 verses total. Read Chronologically as it was revealed, would mean chopping up chapters here and there and while meanings of specific passages might remain intact they would lose their greater context in the placement within the specific chapters that those passages are a part of. That said when one studies *Tafsir* (Quranic exegis) the time, place, and circumstance of that passage being revealed is also studied, provided such specific information is known.

In this matter there is consensus amongst Islamic Scholars regarding the ordering and placement of verses were established before the death of the Prophet and there are *Hadeeth* which narrate incidents where the Prophet would mention that such and such verses are part of such and such *Surah*. These examples range from statements by various senior companions to the Prophet himself. As just one example, quoting the translation of the relevant part out of a Hadith from *Saheeh Muslim* , Book of Inheritance, where Umar bin Al Khattab was relating the response of the Prophet to a question about the inheritance of the one who dies without any living direct descendants

>Umar, does the *ayat-us-sayf*, at the end of Sura al-Nisa' does not suffice you? 

There are other narrations more directly related to the ordering of verses but I'm more comfortable quoting out of *Saheeh Muslim* for a quick example. So regarding the actual ordering of the verses within their chapters, there isn't any disagreement amongst Islamic Scholars, at least amongst the Sunni schools.

Now onto the actual ordering of the *Surahs* this is actually down to two scholarly opinions. Either the order that is preserved in the Manuscript of Uthman was given by the Prophet or it was set down by the deliberation and consensus of the Senior Companions of the Prophet. Even amongst those of the latter opinion there's a lot of leeway that the preferred order of most of the chapters was known prior to the death of the Prophet. The majority opinion seems to be that while a lot of the ordering of *Surahs* were known before the death of the Prophet, some were still left up to the deliberation of the companions.

Amongst the companions though, there wasn't really a full on consensus regarding that ordering. There were in fact other Manuscripts before the Manuscript of Uthman was standardized that had different orderings like the Manuscript of Ubayy bin Ka'ab which started with *Surah Al Baqara* then *Surah An Nisa'* and then *Surah Al Imran* which is different from the Uthmani Manuscript which places Imran before Nisa' along with other major changes. Ultimately though the order that is in the Manuscript of Uthman is the one that survived to today and I am not aware of any more recent attempts to change that order.

So to sun up the answer, according to Islamic sources, the order of chapters was mostly decided and taught by the Prophet himself and what parts were uncertain were placed by the companions through *Ijtihaad*"

AskHistorians,How long have people been wearing clothes with words on them?,"In the medieval Middle East, you could definitely find clothing with words on them and even specifically with words as the main means of adornment. You could find the written word on the sleeves of robes and on scarves and turbans. Clothing adorned with words were given as gifts between rulers, worn at coronations, and made their way throughout the Mediterranean, even influencing European fashions. These calligraphic inscriptions could be very ornate and the main focus of the garment's decoration--covered in gold leaf, embroidered, woven in tapestry. The words themselves could be prayers, poetry, and even simple 'Made in \[insert workshop here\]'.  This was tiraz, the practice of embellishing fabric with text, and it was a big deal. Tiraz workshops were profitable, sponsored by royalty, and played an important role in the social, economic, and political landscape of the region.

So what is tiraz, anyways? How did it come about? The word itself comes from the Persian word for embroidery, but in Arabic, and subsequently in English, it refers to fabric (not just clothing) that has been decorated with words, usually in the form of calligraphic inscriptions, and to the workshops that produced such fabric. Tiraz fabric was commonly produced from the 8th -14th centuries across the Islamic Middle East, with examples stretching from Al-Andalus to Iran. The origins of tiraz are uncertain, but it likely developed from existing pre-Islamic practices in the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia where rulers sponsored textile workshops. There are fabrics from Egypt with Greek and Coptic text from before the Islamic era. The aniconism of Islam possibly played a role in the development of tiraz too . Calligraphy was a common way to decorate buildings, pottery, metalwork, and (of course) books. It's not surprising that it was also used to decorate clothing as well.

Ibn Khaldun stated:

*Before Islam, the kings of Persia had placed upon their garments, either the portraits or likenesses of the kings of the country, or certain figures and images designed for these uses. The Muslim princes substituted their names for the figures, adding other words considered to be of good augury, which gave the praise of God. Under these two dynasties, it was a most important and honorable concern.*

This brings up another important point about tiraz-it was closely related to expressions of royal power and influence. Having the name of the ruler on tiraz was a sign of legitimacy and the strength of government, like having the ruler's name on coins or mentioned in Friday sermons.  As Ibn Khaldun describes it, ""One of the splendors of power and sovereignty, and one of the customs of many dynasties"". Likewise, removing a rival's name from the tiraz removed their legitimacy. One of the most common type of inscriptions invoked blessings upon the local ruler. A full example would include the bismillah, the ruler's names and titles, blessings, and the location and date of production. [This](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O77230/tiraz-tiraz-unknown/) example reads, ""Might and long life to the noble prince Nasr al-Dawlah Abu Nasr, may God give him life long"" (the emir of Diyarbakr around 1026).  [This](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O85096/woven-silk-unknown/) one repeats, ""Glory to our lord the Sultan"" and it's from Granada. There were tiraz workshops owned by the government, producing goods for the royal court, and they were extremely profitable. Textiles in general during this period were a major part of the economy, and a source of wealth and investment for their owners. The largest tiraz factories of the Fatimid era are said to have an income of 200,000 dinars per <i>day</i>.

The earliest mentions of a royal workshop that specifically produced tiraz comes from the Ummayad era, during the  Umayyad caliph Hisham b. Abd al-Malik, who ruled from 723-743 CE. One of the earliest extant examples, the [Marwan tiraz](https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/regional-traditions/middle-east-and-north-africa/medieval-middle-east-and-north-africa/marwan-tiraz) , also dates to around this era, and refers to either his father or one of his successors. The fragmentary inscription reads, "".... \[the servant of\] God, Mrwn (Marwan), Commander of the \[faithful\] ... in the tiraz of Ifriqiya......"", listing the ruler of the time and the location where it was made (Ifriqiya, modern Tunisia).  The institution further developed under the Abbasids, and especially the Fatimids.

The fabrics produced by these royal tiraz workshops played an important role in one of the major diplomatic customs of the Middle East at this time--the robe of honor, or khil'a. Khil'a referred to the practice of bestowing gifts of clothing upon someone. These robes were given as diplomatic gifts or signs of favor from the ruler to subjects. The public presentation of these robes of honor displayed the ruler's generosity and strengthened the social relationship between gifter and giftee. And the tiraz inscriptions, adorned with a ruler's names and titles, and calling down blessings upon him, were a visual display of the power of the ruler and the state. There were also religious connotations as well. Some are obvious: the presence of Qur'anic inscriptions and du'a on tiraz. But clothing received from the caliph, especially straight from his body, or bearing his name, was considered to have blessings. Khil'a was ubiquitous, and the degree to which it was employed increased over time. It formed part of the salaries of government officials. Many, many, descriptions of gifting robes of honor exist. Ibn Battuta received several robes of honour during his travels. Charlemagne received one from the Abbasid court. This custom was also imitated by non-royalty, who also gave gifts of clothing to each other.  The Mamluk writer Al-Qalqashandi described some of the gifts given by the Sultan:

*The highest ranking military leaders get an upper coat produced of red atlas silk, embroidered with brocade and with a collar of squirrel fur...An exquisite scarf that is wrapped around him and that is of white silk on both sides--the honorific names of the Sultan appear on these two sides.*

The gifts were not always appreciated. One religious scholar refused the ornate silk robe gifted to him for religious reasons, but accepted the plainer wool robe the Sultan gave in place of it. Accepting a robe of honor from one's enemies could have consequences. When the vizier of the Ghaznavid sultan Mahmud accepted a robe of honor from the Fatimid Sultan, the dynastic enemies of the Abbasids who were the suzerains of the Ghaznavids, the vizier was denounced as a traitor by the Abbasid Caliph, who called for his execution. Instead, the robe was sent to Baghdad, the Abbasid capital, and burnt."

AskHistorians,"How much credence should I put in the ""Santa Claus = Siberian mushroom shaman"" story I hear every year?","I’m not an historian, but I am an ethnobotanist (intersection of anthropology and biology) and involved in contemporary indigenous religious traditions from Siberia. So, as you might imagine I’ve heard and wondered about this often-repeated story.

To me most indicating is that there are no scholarly sources that support the connection between Santa Claus and Siberian shamans. Even the few scientists often cited in popular articles to support the claim, have written no articles discussing a possible link. Any possible Siberian origin for Santa is thus either unstudied or non-existent. Either way meaning that any conclusive statements confirming the connection are unscientific.

&#x200B;

It is often claimed that the image of Santa originates with shamans who consume Amanita ritually. Popular articles usually talk about visually comparable aspects of (imagined) shamanic practices and contemporary Christmas traditions, which gives the impression to that the latter was derived from the former. There are two reasons to why this is unlikely: Shamanic traditions were likely to be different form those claimed in these articles; and There are more likely origins for modern Christmas traditions.

&#x200B;

Most popular articles talking about a presumed Siberians shamanism – Christmas connection start by saying that many people think that Coca-Cola invented Santa and that this is not true. Indeed, Santa was not invented by Coca-Cola, however not being completely invented by a corporation does not mean that Santa has been inspired by shamanic practices.

Most contemporary Christmas traditions are more likely to originate in European cultures. (Like is outlined in the tread u/DuvalHeart linked) In Rome Saturnalia was celebrated. In Germanic cultures Yule was celebrated, where in some traditions Wodan (Odin) or other figures would bring gifts. As Christianity spread, these traditions were absorbed into local Christian traditions. During the Middle Ages children were often given gifts on the evening before the name day of Saint Nicholas, an early Christian bishop. Subsequently during the late Middle Ages (pre-Christian) local traditions and Saint Nicholas developed into various traditions, which would in turn inspire Santa. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas became known as Sinterklaas who is still celebrated as the predominant December-based gift-giver. In England the tradition of gift-giving moved to Christmas day, and their gift giver became known as Father Christmas.

By the 17th century many modern Christmas traditions were already present in some form in western European cultures. For example, the 17th century painting ‘Het Sint-Nicolaasfeest’ (‘The Feast of Saint Nicholas’) depicts people looking up into the chimney through which Saint Nicholas would have entered the home.

From the 19th century Ded Moroz, a figure from Slavic mythology, mixed with the Saint Nicholas tradition became the gift giver in Russia. A figure derived from Ded Moroz is present in indigenous Siberian peoples, known as Kish Babai (Old man Winter) in Tatar or Khys Khaan (Lord of Cold) in Sakha. At its earliest possible cultural exchange between Russians and indigenous Siberians surrounding this winter gift-giver started around the 19th century. Much too late to have inspired western European and American Christmas traditions."
AskHistorians,What explains Japan's relatively large population compared to its size?,"In general Japan has the benefit of being an island nation that, whilst mountainous, also has fertile plain regions that historically have been able to support large populations (e.g. the Kanto plain, Nobi plain and Osaka plain). Being separated from the continent of Asia has benefitted the country by insulating it from large scale wars. In the past two thousand years, the only two external invasions of Japan were by the Mongols (1274 and 1281 AD) and the USA in WWII (1944-45). Civil strife and famine did, like everywhere else on the planet, occur, but its geography is a benefit that is a historical constant that I would highlight.

But your question is specifically for the population of Japan c. 1700, so let me address that in more detail. The victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and the Siege of Osaka Castle in 1615 ended what is commonly refered to as the 'Sengoku Jidai' (the 'Warring States period'), a period lasting from the mid 15th century (i.e. c. 150 years) that saw a weakening (and ultimate abolishment) of Japan's previous central authority (the Ashikaga Shogunate, think of it as a military dictatorship). This period saw the splintering of Japan into dozens of regional leaders each vying for various levels of independence, or greater authority.

As you can imagine, the constant warfare lead to disruption to Japan's population growth, with peasant mobilisation, destruction and interuption of farming, and direct violent deaths caused by the conflict all putting a downward trend of the country's demographics. Eventual unification in the late 16th century did not fully end this either, with the internal strife instead being exported abroad via the Toyotomi invasion of Korea between 1592-98, which led to over 100,000 Japanese deaths (not even speaking about the cost to Korea), a significant number for that period in time.

When Tokugawa therefore came to power, the country had suffered significantly due to internal strife, and stability was a prized governing virtue. Resultantly, the Tokugawa Shogunate, which was established just after Sekigahara in 1603 and abolished in 1868 with the Meiji Restoration, largely closed itself off to the outside world, heralding in 250 years without war, or major rebellions.

The peace saw a major expansion in crop rotation, particularly of rice. Previously only a staple of the elite (e.g. an ordnance as late as 1649 by the Tokugawa Shogunate forced peasants not to give rice to their families at harvest time as a way of reducing consumption rates), rice became significantly more accessible amongst all societal classes and by the end of the 18th century most classes will have had rice as a significant part of their dietary staple. By 1670 it became accepted (although not quite universal, that would happen over a century later) practice for farmers to be able to pay their taxes not in rice (as had been common for centuries - much of Japan's wealth valuation had been based on the idea of the koku, a unit of measurement based on rice), but in cash, due to the fast commodification of the product.

So significant was this increase that a new disease became common in urban centers, Kakke, or Edo Wazurai (literally the affliction of Edo, due to its common occurence in Edo/Tokyo). Kakke is a result of a vitamin B deficiency that occurs due to the removal of the hull of the rice necessary in this period for the creation of polished, or white, rice, speaking to the vast quantities of rice now consumed in the fast growing urban centers of the country.

Rice was however not the only crop that benefitted Japan's demographic expansion. The sweet potato, introduced in Japan in 1605 along with the white potato, became a common crop in particularly the west of the country, and improved the crop diversity beyond grains, nuts and rice. This diversity, which meant a lower death toll in the face of major crop failures, is credited for why many Tokugawa era famines, such as the one in Kyushu in 1732, were relatively mild. Sweet potatoes had the other benefit that they could be grown in more hilly or mountainous areas, meaning they largely did not compete with rice for land irrigation.

The prosperity is evident from the heavy urbanisation that occured from the late 17th century onwards, with 3 of the 10 largest cities in the world (Edo, Osaka and Kyoto) being located in Japan. Urbanisation can only occur when there is a surplus in food, and the ability to transport said foodstuffs, evidence of the prosperity of the era.

These surpluses also meant that when famines did occur, there were surpluses stored that could alleviate the worst of a famine. The three major famines that occured in Japan in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Kan'ei famine of 1640-1643 (50k-100k deaths), the previously mentioned Kyoho famine of 1732-1733 (12k-169k deaths) and the Great Tenmei Famine of 1782-1788, the largest famine in the Tokugawa period (100k-920k deaths), saw somewhere between 160k and 1.2 million total deaths. This sounds like a lot, but was actually quite mild considering the amount of time passed, and other famines of this era such as various French (1693-1694, 1.3m-1.5m deaths / 1709-1710, c. 600k deaths), Irish (1741-1742, c.300k-480k deaths) or Russian (1601-1603, c.2m deaths) famines.

In short, Japan's demographic boom in this period is largely thanks to a mix of the peace and prosperity that allowed for a vast expansion in arable land and crop diversity. Whilst headwinds did occur in the 19th century, it's part of the reason why Japan continues to be a relatively densely populated country.

AskHistorians,What are some conceptual blindspots of the Civilization series of video games?,"Some years back I wrote a review of Civ VI [here](https://alexwellerstein.com/publications/wellerstein_reviewciv6(endeavour\).pdf) which I am fairly happy with — it is what these things get wrong as ""simulations"" of history from the perspective of a historian of science and technology. The gist of it is that it is a very 19th-century vision of how history works — teleological, guided by a _Geist_ (the player), focused on war and technology as the driving forces of history — blended down into a ""balanced"" game which introduces some necessary absurdities (because in real life, there is no ""balance,"" but that wouldn't be very fun). 

This does not mean that they could not potentially be a way to get a child interested in the things you are hoping these games might get them interested in. Inspiration comes from many sources."
AskHistorians,"The more I travel, the more it seems that public restroom stalls in the United States are uniquely terrible as far as privacy and build quality. How did this seemingly inadequate design become so widespread in public restrooms?","I assume what you're talking about here are the gaps around a typical American toilet stall?

Believe it or not, this ""uniquely terrible"" design originated with one of America's most celebrated architects, Frank Lloyd Wright.  While designing the Larkin Building in Buffalo, NY, he hit on the idea of toilets separated by suspended partitions with a gap underneath because this would make cleaning easier.  Rather than dealing with multiple edges and corners in each stall, a janitor could just mop right under the partitions or even spray down the whole facility with a hose.  For the same reason, the building also featured suspended toilet bowls (i.e., protruding from the walls rather than down to the ground).

There are other advantages to the gaps for the building owner.  A partition with gaps uses less material making it cheaper to install, the gaps allow for greater air circulation, and some see the lack of privacy as advantageous because it allows for possible monitoring of inappropriate or unwanted behavior within the toilet cubicle.  The ""toe gap"" provided under the partition also allows someone in a wheelchair to maneuver more easily and thus allows for the user of a smaller space while complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Finally, the the gap size can vary somewhat, allowing the installation of standardized, prefabricated toilet cubicles without any need for expensive customization to the space.

In short, the ""gaps"" are advantageous for building owners and that's who makes the choice.   But, there's a second part to your question.  Why didn't other peer countries follow the same path?

I can only speculate here, but it seems likely that at least part of the answer is that you get what you pay for.  Free public toilets are much more common in the United States than in Europe, where pay toilets are often the norm.   Pay toilets were also common in the United States up until the 1970s, when a successful grassroots movement spearheaded by the Committee to End Pay Toilets in America (CEPTIA -- interestingly founded by teenagers) succeeded in changing laws all around the country to ban or restrict pay toilets and favor free ones largely framing the issue in terms of gender equity.

This means that an American public restroom is purely an expense, and the incentive of the owner/operator to contain costs with the cheaper 'gap' design is paramount.  European toilets  often generate revenue, so there's an offsetting motive.  Similarly, you'll often find nicer or more private restroom facilities in American contexts where the restrooms are catering to paying customers rather than passers by."
AskHistorians,"I’ve read that in 17th century Kraków, the various guilds of the city were each assigned a tower they had the responsibility of manning in the event of an attack. How did this work in practice? Was this common practice? And did any guilds ‘perform’ worse than others in this task?","Having guilds assigned to the protection of the city - and its walls, gates, towers, streets, and public areas - was extremely common in Europe in the 17th century. Guilds, in many cases, were a civic institution as well as an organization of businesses, and participation and membership in guilds often conferred on a household (not necessarily just an individual) the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Those rights and responsibilities often included the right to bear personal arms as well as the responsibility to serve in the city watch, in whatever particular way your citizenship entailed. 

These obligations were individual - each citizen had to purchase and maintain their own weapons and armor stipulated by their service - and communal - the guild itself was responsible for supporting armories, gunpowder, expenses or labor for maintaining the walls and suchlike - and each city essentially had a slightly different makeup of guilds and responsibilities for their own needs.

While I should say straight away I'm less familiar with Kraków than I am, say, Augsburg, I have posted several times about the organization and duties of city watches and militias in central Europe, some of which you can find here:

[Cities and military levies](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x8vxt3/i_am_a_medieval_peasant_how_do_i_get_drafted_for/inlq6w8/)

[Militia organization in Early Modern Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/uijkse/the_infantry_of_medieval_armies_were_often_not/i7ftove/)

On to your other questions: would professional jealousy or competition get in the way of protecting the city? Would the guilds compete for favor from the authorities? Would individuals and groups shirk their responsibilities or hire out to take off the burden?

The answer to all of these is, more or less, a qualified *yeah*. Imagine you, through your employer, have to serve a midnight shift as a combination cop and firefighter once every month. On top of that, you have to pay for a cruiser (or a firetruck) along with a group of other employees, and you have to supply your own uniform, gun, body armor, and other accoutrements, at risk of a fine. On top of that, you have to respond to emergencies when you hear sirens, *and* serve as a firefighter. If the country goes to war, your employer might choose to support the cause by sending you to fight. Allowing for the fact that this was a complicated thing and individuals had very different impulses regarding martial service, this is nothing short of a heavy *burden* that interferes with your other responsibilities - such as production within your trade guild. 

There were numerous ways to shirk these responsibilities. You could *borrow* a set of weapons and armor for the rare times you might need to muster for an inspection to allay the costs of owning and maintaining them - though there was a risk that you and the friend you borrowed from getting caught and fined. You could - often legally - hire a substitute to serve in your stead, and many cities in early modern Europe would likely have had a large population of armed non-citizens who served critical functions of the city watch in a sort of semi-permanent status as replacements for guildmembers and citizens. You would, in this case, be responsible for outfitting your replacement, *and* you might be held responsible if your replacement committed a crime or failed to report for duty. Substitutes were especially common in households led by a widow. While the widow was unlikely to toss on her late husband's armor and serve a watch rotation, she *would* be responsible for finding a suitable replacement until she remarried. In more extreme cases, individuals might oppose militia burdens entirely, and protest their required service in a number of ways; refusing to pay fines, refusing to muster for parades and inspections, that kind of thing.

At the *guild* level, responsibilities to serve the city could be negotiated, and were often assigned relative to the size and power of the individual guilds. Larger guilds had a larger civic burden, had to supply more armed men, had to serve more city towers and the like. But things change, and the power and influence of specific trades could wax and wane, and so burdens could shift, say, between the crossbow makers and the arquebus makers (to use a simplified fictional example). But what's critical to your question here is that the guild leadership *is* the city leadership. Guilds elected members to serve in city councils in some cities - like Augsburg - or could influence council members and unrelated politicians with money and favors. This system was widespread because it made sense, guilds profit from the stability of the city and its prominence in regional and international trade, and so their responsibility to protect it and keep it stable was reciprocal and intuitive. There's no profit in letting the walls collapse, or letting riots burn down quarters of the city, or allowing an attacker to threaten the city.

So while there would be some competition between guilds, that competition was often more in *showing off* how great at the job they were, instead of trying to shirk. Guilds wanted to be the ones to, say, maintain the cannons, because that was sexy and fun, since you get to fire them and practice with them. Protecting the largest and coolest looking tower in the city was a thing of pride. Maintaining the gate that had the most traffic in and out, and running it efficiently was similarly worthy of pride. We can perhaps imagine the same pride in fighting fires more effectively and efficiently or *preventing* fires altogether. One guild might have a more uniform look and prescription on specific types of armor or weapons carried because uniformity looks more organized and serious than letting guildsmen pick up whatever cheap options are available. Service like this represents your *guild* as much as your city, and a more professional, organized, good-looking guild meant, hopefully, more interest in wealthy tradesmen looking to have their sons or relatives train up in that trade, which meant more business, more profit, and more power.

All of this is difficult to generalize, because there were massive differences in organization between city and city and, within cities, between guilds and guilds. Importantly, though, a guild was centered *within* a city, and so there was a sense of comradeship between city guilds, often because the city's guilds weren't in direct competition with one another - silk weavers, say, have little competitive overlap with cabinet-makers - but instead compete against similar guilds in other, perhaps *rival* cities. Genoese silk weavers would certainly be a threat to the Kraków silk weavers, and so professional jealousies and competition and politicking might rear their heads in any situation in which both of those cities might compete for far-flung markets. But within a city, these kinds of competition were minimal.

To sum up, guild membership was directly related to citizenship, and while the institution of civic militias handled day-to-day burdens of defense and security generally, individual stresses and individual irritation with the burden led to all kinds of resistance, from providing expensive substitutes to openly defying guild burdens as a whole. But because trade guilds were insular and (often) intensely localized, guilds within their own cities weren't in direct competition between one another - rivalries, jealousies, and power-jockeying aside - and instead had a comradeship looking *out* toward other cities.

Hope that helps, even if it was more of a generalized answer than I think you were looking for."
AskHistorians,"Today, Syria and Libya use Arabicised Greek names Sūrīyah and Lībiyā instead of more traditional Arabic names like al-Shām and Ṭarābulus, but Egypt still calls itself Miṣr (or, Maṣr). Was there ever any debate or support for changing the name to something derived from Aigyptos or Kmt/Kmy?","I do not have enough knowledge to answer your question, but as a Syrian and an Arab myself, there are a few things I need to point out.

> Damascus (itself called *al-Shām*) 

Damascus is only referred to as al-Sham colloquially and by Levintines (in this case, I mean people from the Levant. I think Levantine is sometimes used to refer to Arab Christians in the Levant). Officially, and outside the Levant, Damascus is known as *Dimashq* (the Arabic equivalent to the name Damascus). This is mainly a result of Damascus being the capital of the Levant or Bilad al-Sham (pronounced as ash-Sham, if you ever wondered how to pronounce it correctly), where people started to refer to Damascus simply as *al-Sham*. Interestingly, this tradition only exists in Syria and Egypt. Where Cairo is also colloquially referred to as *Masr* instead of the Arabic name of the city, *al-Qahira*.

> The Ottomans seem to have referred to the area exclusively as *Ṭarābulus* (*Gharb*, as opposed to *Ṭarābulus al-Shām* in Lebanon)

It is not clear by what you wrote here if you are fully aware, but I will explain this part anyway. The name of Libya under Ottoman rule, namely *Tarablus al-Gharb*, originates from its capital and largest city, Tripoli. Known in Arabic as *Tarablus*, and differentiated from the Lebanese Tripoli by adding *al-Gharb* which means: the west, or of the west. Additionally, Libya does not really have another name, even in Arabic. The only thing I found was *Lubiya*, used by early Islamic historians, and as you can see it is just an Arabicised version of Libya. Libya was generally part of *al-Maghrib*, (which means the west or literally, ""where the sun sets""), and thus did not need a name of its own. So, perhaps there was no need to change the name Libya to another more Arabic name, and even if there was, there were no other alternatives.

> Syria, which never seems to have revived the term *al-Shām* (though IS/Daesh has, for what I assume are anti-Western reasons)

My impression, and I can well be mistaken here, is that the name al-Sham carries much more Islamic significance than an Arabic one. This is probably why ISIS (and I believe most if not all religious extremists) use this name instead of Syria. Another reason for this could be, as you mentioned, the disproportionate role played by Christian Syrians in the rise of Arab nationalism in the late 19^(th) and early 20^(th) centuries or what is also known as the Arab Renaissance, where the name Syria perhaps became more associated with the modern, secular, and Arab *Suria*, rather than the old, Islamic *al-Sham*. Additionally, Syria is not that foreign of a name. It comes from Assyria or Ashur, which is a native name to the land anyway.

> *qubṭ* refer to Christians or Copts (and are often derogatory)

I haven't heard of a case where the term *Qubt* was used in a derogatory mean. It just means Copt and is used normally by Copts in Egypt. While the Copts might face hate from Islamist extremists, I don't think the name plays any part in this issue.

As you mentioned, Egypt was always Misr. I don't think there was a need to find another name, and just like Libya, even if they did they didn't have a lot to choose from."
AskHistorians,Why did polygamy never catch on in European monarchies?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"Hey guys, does anyone know when the zee/zed split happened between American and British English? Just curious. Thanks in advance!","Early 1800s.

If you ever wonder “why is this thing different in American English”, the answer is probably going to be Noah Webster. The writer of the first “American” English dictionary. He, personally, thought it a good idea to differentiate American English and [simplify spelling and certain enunciations.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/about-us/spelling-reform). This was due to a general patriotic movement to differentiate the US more from England in more than just language. And it wasn’t *entirely* Webster. Ben Franklin was also an early advocate of simplifying parts of the language. 

But Webster wrote the actual book on spelling and pronunciation with his first dictionary, published in 1806. The first American dictionary is responsible, for example, in dropping the “U” in color/colour or changed a lot of soft “C’s” in words. Some managed to cross the Atlantic entirely like changing the spelling of “musick” to music. Some didn’t take at all like “wimmen” or “tung” and Webster backed down from his more radical spellings in his 1828 dictionary edition. 

Sure enough, look through and you’ll see “Zee” is his official decision for how to pronounce “Z”. That pronunciation was known at the time but far less common that the ""Zed"" used in Britain, then and today. The ""Zee"" pronunciation also rhymes with half the other letters in the alphabet: Bee, Cee, Dee, Eee, Gee, etc). The alphabetic rhyming of the new American pronunciation is also probably the reason it became hard solidified in US consciousness. In 1835 a Boston publisher wrote and copy-wrote [“the Alphabet song”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_song). Yes, *that* alphabet song that’s still used in classrooms and Sesame Street today. The song featured the new “Z” pronunciation. So every American child for about 180 years has learned the Zee pronunciation as ""correct."" 

Complete side note; the true title of the Alphabet song is *The A.B.C., A German Air with Variations for the Flute with an Easy Accompaniment for the Piano Forte.* Which I find hilarious considering its just saying the letters of the alphabet to *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* (which itself is even taking the melody from a 1700s French song). 

As to why **Canada** still uses “Zed”, one can thank titan of progressive rock drumming, [Neil Peart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMDmN70Uui4&t=10s), for creating a drum solo in 1981 that [nobody heretofore has been able to duplicate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBJO3Zj-Sv0&t=16s)"
AskHistorians,How has the Japanese Imperial Family remained so absurdly small after nearly 1500 years of continuous rule?,"There are many descendants of the imperial line beyond the 11 Kyu-Miyake you mentioned.

Your confusion comes from the fact that the ""Imperial Family"" does not equate to ""those sharing the bloodline of the emperors"". The Imperial Family is a legal construct, properly defined first in 1889 by the Meiji Imperial Household Law (皇室典範). This law defined the imperial family as being the emperor's direct family and also grandfathered in various houses of imperial princes (親王) . These houses were those who had been conferred the title of imperial prince (親王宣下) during the Muromachi to Edo eras, even if their bloodlines had diverged from the ruling emperor generations ago. Only one of these houses (Fushimi no miya) was still surviving by 1947, which is when their members (split across 11 branch families) got excluded by the GHQ.

As you might imagine, there were many offspring from the emperors across time (especially given that polygamy was the norm). However, before the Meiji law an descendent of the emperors was not automatically conferred imperial status without a 親王宣下. Many of these simply filtered out into various noble (公家) households. Even as early as the Heian era, emperors faced budgetary issues in keeping even their immediate household afloat. This lead to them asking many of their direct offsprings to voluntarily remove themselves from imperial status (臣籍降下), which is where notable bushi lines like the Seiwa Genji and Kanmu Heishi come from."
AskHistorians,Why is South Africa the only African country where the population of white colonizers and their descendants remained throughout the 20th century?,"Oh a question on South Africa, right in my wheelhouse! So to answer this question I will be utilizing a previous answer I have used to answer a similar question about a year ago with some modifications for clarity. 



Now to provide a short answer: South Africa was the last African country to decolonize and its white population was larger and had longer ties to the land than in other African colonial states.

The long answer: 

First is important to mention that South Africa was not the only colonial African state that attempted to institute a racialized society and have the white population enrich and empower themselves with the intention of staying. Examples of this can be seen in Algeria, Kenya, and Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) all of which had violent revolutions that ultimately lead to the white populations leaving. If you would like to know more about these cases either in the aggregate or individually just let me know. I'll reference them in comparison to the South Africa in my response. Settler colonial states in Africa all had violent transitions of power or at least violence spurring on the transition of power. From Algeria to Kenya to Angola removing the white settler was a rallying cry for black liberation movements and revolutionaries. To them the project wouldn’t be completed until they were back in control.

However, (generally speaking) the whites living in these areas were not as attached to the land as in South Africa. For a family living in say Kenya for a couple generations it was preferable to move back to the UK then live under African rule. In cases where whites had stronger connections to the land in places like Zimbabwe it is worth noting that the leader there, Mugabe, made a point of trying to force whites to emigrate by seizing land and businesses.

Now let’s look at the case of South Africa specifically. South Africa has and has had the largest white population of any settler state in Africa. And on top of that many of the families there had been living there for many, many generations (some going back to the 1600s). And they identified as South African- going to the UK was already highly unlikely for the English speaking whites and going to the UK or Netherlands for the Afrikaans speaking whites was seen as impossible as that was no longer their home. For this reason decolonization could not happen like it did in Ghana, were a comparatively few white government officials and businessmen (who in all likelihood were born in the UK anyway) just packed up and left. In the case of all settler colonies in Africa it is only after violent actions did decolonization actually take place. Now it is worth noting that many historians continue to debate the effect violent resistance had in the case of the end of Apartheid in South Africa. But in any case it does follow this same trend and black opposition did engage in a violent revolution and it is not until after this point that significant gains are made towards black liberation in Southern Africa. In South Africa, the whites had no intention of leaving and Black opposition knew this. That is why the message of the ANC was never to create a blacks-only state, they knew it would never work and instead opted for fighting for equality and a multi-racial society. The ANC was a multiracial party and movement which included Indians and whites as well as blacks. And while the ANC did use violence, there was no race war or large scale local revolution inside South Africa that would have pushed race relations to the brink. Instead there was free and fair elections that opened South Africa to democracy and a multiracial society. Basically short of a race war, there was no way the white population in South Africa was going anywhere and the largest spokes-people for Black opposition in South Africa, the ANC, did not want a blacks-only society or at least knew it would never realistically exist. 

Time is also a factor. Southern Africa in general was much later to the decolonization party as compared to their Northern and West Africa comrades (not for a lack of trying). While 1960 was the year of African decolonization, with new states popping up in West Africa like Ghana, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, things were just beginning to heat up in Southern Africa. The Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa convinced many for the need for violent revolution and resistance also happens in 1960, most resistance before this was non-violent. The MPLA in Angola doesn't start fighting the Portuguese until 1961 and ZAPU in Zimbabwe wasn't even formed until 1961. South Africa, with the help of the United States, created a zone of influence in Southern Africa doing everything they could to stop or at least slow the advancement of African Liberation Movements. They were largely successful until the 1970s. We have to remember that Apartheid in South Africa itself did not end until 1991. Up until around 1985 I would argue most people in South Africa thought that the Apartheid government would continue to hold onto power for the foreseeable future. So there was no reason for the White population to worry about moving or fleeing or anything of that nature even speaking in the short term. 

Hopefully this helps add some context and answers your question. If you have any other questions or follow-up feel free to ask! :)

AskHistorians,"Around AD 552 two Byzantine monks smuggled silkworms eggs out of China, allowing the Mediterranean to produce its own silk for the first time. Were there any consequences for those who had been duped? Did the Chinese ever figure out the heist?","There are two accounts written in the 500s, one
contemporary to the supposed events, one later. It
is not automatic that a later account means
false; it does mean we have something to
cross-reference to work out if there are
any common elements. Unfortunately, due to
some other circumstantial factors, it is
unlikely either version is true.

The first version is by Procopius of Caesarea who was contemporary to the alleged events; I've quoted a portion,
although if you want to read the whole thing I will put it as
a reply to this answer.

>About the same time certain monks arrived from the (country of the) Indians, and learning that
the Emperor Justinian had it much at heart that the Romans should no longer buy silk from the
Persians, they came to the king and promised that the Romans should not have to purchase the
article either from the Persians or from any other nation; for they had lived, they said, a long time in the country where there were many nations of the Indians, and which goes by the name SERINDA.

It is unclear where Serinda is actually referring to, as various locations have been
named; it may be farther west than contemporary India, but it definitely is not referring to China. Sogdia (a location in ancient Iran) is a popular choice; the problem is while we have Sogdian silks from the 7th and 8th centuries, we don't have any from the 6th century; the only evidence in that direction is in a Sogdian embassy in Constantinople having silk for sale in 568, but the silk is not mentioned as Sogdian and could easily have been imported.

The account goes on to explain that the monks explain that bringing caterpillars as a way to
bypass the Persian trade would not work, but eggs could be covered with dung and be hatched upon arrival. Justinian offers ""large promises of reward"" for doing the task, and the monks ""went back again to India"" and return with the eggs in question, successfully nurturing them into caterpillars and henceforth a Byzantine silk industry.

There is no mention of the theft being discovered; maybe we'd expect that from an Indian source, but none of
them mention this, possibly for the reason the story might be utter nonsense. I'll get to why in a moment,
but first let's look at the other account, from Theophanes of Byzantium, who was writing at the end of the century.

>Now in the reign of Justinian a certain Persian exhibited in Byzantium the mode in which (silk) worms arc hatched, a thing which the Romans had never known before. The Persian on coming
away from the country of the Seres had taken with him the eggs of these worms (concealed) in
a walking stick, and succeeded in bringing them safely to Byzantium.

In the first story, Justinian requested the silk heist be performed, and the monks did the
deed and came back. In this variation, a ""certain Persian"" did the deed, and just brought it on their own. Additionally, the Persian came from ""the country of the Seres"".

""Seres"" is its own loaded word, sometimes used to refer to India, sometimes used to refer to China (depending on the historian) but the important thing is how the Byzantines of the 6th century understood the word, which seems to not reference a specific place at all: just ""the place where silk comes from"". (Notice that to get the original ""two monks in China"" story you have to mash the two stories together _and_ presume that ""where silk comes from"" is meaning China.)

The fact is that sericulture is a complex process which requires an established industry, and is not as simple as one or two people bringing a set of eggs. Mulberries need proper cultivation, there are many ways silkworms can get infected, and the process of reeling the silk itself is also delicate.

We have records from China -- which carefully noted when sericulture occurred outside the country -- that the late Han dynasty (25 to 220 CE) mentions Daqin as having a silk industry. In the Tang dynasty (618-906) this region was called Fulin.

It gets referenced once as a place with animals of

>...the donkey, the mule, the camel, and the mulberry silkworm.

Where is Daqin/Fulin? This is a controversial and complex debate, but there is strong reason to think it was in reference to Syria, and that sericulture started there at least by the 5th century.

This means sericulture likely simply have come from there via a more gradual transfer, which is far more plausible than assuming an entire industry -- which requires more than just access to eggs -- was brought in via walking stick.

Short answer, it is a self-congratulatory with minimal empirical data to back it, since even when Weber wrote it, Catholic France wasn't exactly slouching economically. In the long answer, what you've stumbled upon is a theory we discuss frequently in economics called 'the great divergence', that is trying to figure out when, where, and how (and if) Britain and Western Europe experienced rapid economic growth that elevated it above the rest of the world. 

Kenneth Pomeranz in his work '[The Great Divergence](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-great-divergence/kenneth-pomeranz/9780691217185)', for example, argues that the 'Divergence' happened significantly later than is typically argued, namely in the 1750s, as up until the late 18th century, the Chinese economy and quality of life was still comparable to those found in Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Deirdre McCloskey in her 'bourgeois trilogy', but more specifically in '[Bourgeois Dignity](https://www.waterstones.com/book/bourgeois-dignity/deirdre-n-mccloskey/9780226556741)' argues that the 'great divergence' is merely temporary and not due to British or Dutch protestantism, but rather because of other institutions and ideas surrounding early capitalist development, such as constitutionalism (limiting the power of the crown/state/church), education, banking, and stock markets. McCloskey would point out that the 'motherland' of protestantism, Germany, stayed comparably poorer than Catholic France and Spain until relatively recently, removing Protestantism's power as a causal mechanism. Indeed, if Protestantism was an economic driver, why didn't it drive all Protestant states to wealth? 

Arslan (2001) further posits, [in a slightly problematic paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25074540), that the 'Protestant Work Ethic' could also be 'outdone' by the 'Muslim work ethic' found in the Ottoman Empire and later in the Republic of Turkey. 

Of course, here we can also address the elephant in the room. Arslan's paper focuses on Catholic Ireland, and here we have to ask why Ireland is poor. Is it poor because of the 'lack of ethic' in Catholicism, or is it poor because of British colonialism? As [Lyons (2013)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24389689) points out, a key part of British rule in Ireland was its typical 'divide and rule' mentality that favoured Protestant settlers in Ireland over the indigenous Catholics. [McGowan (2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26986061) further points out that British policy only allowed the Protestant Anglo-Irish elite to own lands in Ireland, and their insistence on growing 'cash crops' is a big part of what led to the The Great Famine, which hollowed out Ireland further. [Kinealy (1995)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27724290) points out that the Great Famine caused Ireland to lag behind comparable European states. This isn't because the Catholic Irish were 'lazy', they were being legislated into economic disadvantage. Simultaneously, Britain's colonial empire, not her protestantism, allowed Britain to amass a great wealth at the expense of her entire empire, not just Ireland. 

As [Parthasarathi (2011)](https://www.waterstones.com/book/why-europe-grew-rich-and-asia-did-not/prasannan-parthasarathi/9780521168243) points out, the British Industrial Revolution, which is often cited as one of the beginning points of 'the great divergence' could only occur because of British colonialisation of the 'new world' and South Asia, as it put Britain in a position to get a lot of cheap cotton from slave labour in the 'new world' and protectionist policies put in place in both Britain and East India Company-controlled India favoured British textile manufacturors over their Indian counterparts, who had dominated the global textile trade for centuries before that. This has little to do with Britain's Protestant faith, and everything to do with Britain's colonial empire.

Of course, and as always, we can point out the obvious counter-factuals here. China, the Ottoman Empire, the Mughal Empire of India, and Imperial China were all not Christian, let alone not Protestant, and yet managed to out compete Protestants for centuries on the global stage until Protestant countries managed to subdue them militarily. And even then, Catholic France stood toe-to-toe with Protestant Britain throughout much of the 18th and 19th centuries. As one of my professors put it, Britain only won because we were the 'better pirates'. The Protestant faith had little to do with it."

AskHistorians,"In 1755 an earthquake and subsequent disasters destroyed Lisbon. In 1761, Portugal became one of the first countries to abolish slavery. What role did slaves play in rebuilding the city before and after the abolishment? How controversial was this?","Before addressing the role of slaves in the rebuilding of Lisbon, I think it's important to first address an issue in the question, that being the incorrect, popular belief that Portugal abolished slavery in 1761. On the 19th of September 1761, King José I of Portugal decreed, via royal charter:

> que se possam carregar, nem transportar escravos pretos de hum e outro sexo dos pórtos da América, África e Ásia para os destes Reinos de Portugal e do Algarve

Translation:

> that black slaves of either sex from the ports of America, Africa and Asia may not be carried or transported to these Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarve

There was no abolition of slavery. It was a simple ban on the transport of slaves from the rest of the domains of the Portuguese Empire into the very specifically established, Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarve, meaning the European Domains of the Portuguese Crown. Further down the decree it is also said why such a decree is being made:

> muitos e grandes inconvenientes que resultam do excesso, e devassidão com que contras as Leys e costumes de outras Cortes polidas se transporta...para estes Reitos hum tão extraordinário numero de escravos Pretos, que fazendo nos Meus Domínios Ultramarinos huma sensivel falta para cultura das Terras e das Minas, só vem a este Continente occupar os lugares dos moços de servir, ficando sem commodo se entregam á ociosidade e se precipitão nos vicios

Translation:

> many and great inconveniences resulting from the excess and debauchery with which, contrary to the laws and customs of other polite Courts, such an extraordinary number of black slaves are brought to these Kingdoms, that in my Overseas Domains there is a considerable lack of them to cultivate the lands and mines, and they only come to this Continent to occupy the places of the young men who serve them, and, being left without any convenience, they give themselves over to idleness and fall into vices

The decree is very clear on why to ban slave trading into continental Portugal. The slaves were needed overseas, specifically in Brazil, Angola, and São Timor e Príncipe, and the importing of slaves was causing unemployment in Portugal. It's significant to note that it is estimated that about 6 to 7% of the Population of Southern Portugal were slaves in the XVIth century, and a maximum of 5% in the XVII. But Lisbon is the focus of this question and there, and in the Royal Census of 1527 during the reign of King João III, the population of Lisbon was set at 50 to 75,000 people, 10% of which are estimated to have been slaves.

This is important to remember, because there's no moral consideration in the decree of 1761, it's a purely economical decision in order to funnel the Portuguese slave trade into Brazil and address economic problems at home. However, on the 16th of January 1773 another decree was made that directly addressed the issue of emancipation which I will post the full text

> After having prevented by the other charter of 19 September 1761 the great inconveniences which the perpetuation of slavery of black men in these kingdoms was causing, I have had certain information that in all the kingdom of the Algarve, and in some provinces of Portugal, there are still people so lacking in feelings of Humanity and Religion that they keep in their houses Slaves, some whiter than themselves, with the names of Pretas (blacks), and Negras (blacks), others Mestizças (half-breeds), and others truly Negras (blacks); for the reprehensible propagation of them perpetuate the Captivities by an abominable commerce of sins, and usurpations of the liberties of the wretches born of those successive, and profitable concubinages, under the pretext that the wombs of Slave Mothers cannot produce free Children, according to the Civil Law. And not allowing, nor yet the same Law, of which so great an abuse has been made, that the Descendants of Slaves, in whom there is no fault but that of their unhappy condition of Captives, should have the infamy of Captivity extended, beyond the term, which the Laws determine, against those who descend from the most abominable Defendants of the most atrocious crimes of Divine or Human Majesty: And considering the great indecency, that the said Slavery infer to my Vassals; the confusions, and hatreds, that among them cause; and the damages, that result to the State of having so many injured, wasted, and useless Vassals, how many are those miserable, that their unhappy condition makes incapable for public Offices; for Commerce; for Agriculture; and for treaties, and contracts of all kinds:
> I am resolved to avoid all the above absurdities. Commanding, as I do hereby command: As for the past, that all those Slaves, or born of the above mentioned concubinages, or even of legitimate Marriages, whose Mothers, and Grandmothers are, or have been, Slaves, remain in the Captivity, in which they are, during their life only; but those, whose Slavery comes from their Great-grandmothers, remain free, and discharged, even if their Mothers, and Grandmothers have been Slaves: And that all the above, by effect of this My Paternal, and Pious Providence, may be freed, and be fit for all Offices, honours, and dignities, without the distinctive Note of Freedmen, which the superstition of the Romans established in their customs, and which the Christian Union, and Civil Society makes intolerable in My Kingdom today, as it has been in all the others of Europe
> And this shall be fulfilled as fully as it is contained therein. Wherefore: I command the Mesa do Desembargo do Paço; Conselho da Minha Real Fazenda, e do Ultramar, Casa da Suplicação; Mesa da Consciência, e Ordens, Senado da Câmara; Junta do Comércio destes Reinos, e seus Domínios; Governador da Relação, e Casa do Porto; and more Ministers, Officers of Justice, and Persons of these Realms, that they comply and keep, and make entirely comply and keep this my Charter, notwithstanding any other Laws, or dispositions, that oppose its content; which I also derogate for this effect only, remaining always in force. And I command Dr. João Pacheco Pereira, of My Council, who serves as Chancellor General of these Realms, and Lords, to publish and register it in the Chancellery General of the Realm: and likewise it shall be published in my Realms, and in each of their Counties, so that it may come to the knowledge of all, and no ignorance may be alleged: it shall be registered in the Relations of Lisbon, and Porto, and in the other parts, where similar Laws are usually registered, and this same Charter shall be recorded in My Royal Archive of the Torre do Tombo. Given at the Palace of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, on the sixteenth of January of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three.

In practice, the decree of January 16th 1773, established in Portugal and the Algarve, that currently form modern Portugal, a Law of Free Womb. This law directly addresses matters on the morality of slavery, but only in Europe, this is very critical to note, this law only applies in Portugal. The Law of 16-1-1773 does not apply in what were considered the Overseas Domains, meaning the non-European parts of the Portuguese Empire. In Portugal, slavery was gradually abolished via this law, but in the rest of the Empire it continued to be legal in order to continue the goals of the law of 1761 of funnelling the slave trade to where it was most vital for the economical concerns of the Portuguese Crown. And even in this decree we should note the primacy in importance of the economic concerns, the decree goes on considerable lengths to note that the King and his Vassals are being undermined because these slaves cannot engage in all economic fields, which was causing negative effects in Southern Portugal. The major point of discussion and debate during this period is always focused on the economic effect of slavery."

AskHistorians,"Why do countries in Latin America only speak Spanish and not Catalan, Basque, or any of Spain’s other languages?","To present my credentials to answer this - while I am not a historian,  I have a masters degree in Spanish philology, with my academic focus on topics related to the Basque Country and it's relation with Spain, including identity, language and independence movements which give me good insight into minoritary languages of this country and their situation over the centuries. I hope that I will be able to provide an informed answer here, but I am prepared for this to get rightfully removed. 

To answer your question, we must understand how America came to be conquered by the Spanish. While popular depictions may focus on individual adventurers with small expeditions (Hernán Cortés, or Francisco Pizarro and his Trece de la Fama coming to mind), outside of the very early stages, the conquista was a very institutional effort where the attitude and goals of the Spanish state were the defining factors, and not the identity or goals of particular individuals. 

Looking back to 1492 - the years the Spanish have first arrived to the newly discovered continent, or to the islands along it's coast, to be more precise -  the Iberic Peninsula was divided between 4 entities: Portugal (not discussed here), Kingdom of Castile (having newly conquered the remnants of the Emirate of Granada), Kingdom of Aragon (including Catalonia) and Kingdom of Navarra (soon to be incorporated into the Kingdom of Aragon).

Portugal aside, as it's outside of the scope of this question, let's look at those:

Kingdom of Aragon - in no small part due to its geographical location - concentrated it's efforts of the areas in the Mediterranean area, such as Balearic Islands, southern Italy, Sicily and other. As such, any of their languages, official or not (Aragonés, Valenciano, Catalonian) was only transferred to the colonies at an individual level, ie. Because someone who spoke it decided to look for a better fortune there. There was no institutional factor that would give those language footing in the Americas.

The Kingdom of Navarra was, at this point, hardly significant outside of local level, and incorporated in the Kingdom of Castille in 1515, with some autonomy which did not extend into potential colonial efforts. As such, it's official, administrative language - Navarro-Aragonés - would also only be transmitted into the Americas at an individual level. 

Now, coming to our main actor, the Kingdom of Castille. By early XVIth century, it had numerous languages spoken in it's territory. Castillian (which we now know simply as Spanish) was at this time THE administrative language, spoken at court, and further strengthened by the publication of it's first grammar in 1492 (which is a pivotal year in Spanish history, I'm not even listing all the events here!) by de Nebrija. It was the most uniform of the languages spoken in the Kingdom, as it was the language of the ruling elite. 

The case of Galician - areas of which also were covered by Kingdom of Castille - is a curious one. Had the conquest of Americas started 2 or 3 centuries earlier, it would have had a much bigger chance to spread there as well. In the previous centuries, it had a much larger presence in the culture and politics, prime example being the Cantigas de Santa Maria, written by the king Alfonso Xth the learned, who considered it equal to, or superior, to Castillian. That being said, by the early XVIth century it's influence was dwindling, which is reflected in it's decreasing presence in legal documents. 

Basque was in an even worse position - not having been an official langauge of any of the kingdoms, and largely spoken by rural population, with numerous dialects that differed between themselves significantly. 

With that in mind, let's go back to the colonization of America by the Spanish: even if a particular conquistador was a speaker of a language other than Castillian (Lope de Aguirre, a Basque, as a random example), there was little impact of his language in the colonies for at least two reasons:

1.Having to work alongside other subjects of the Castillian crown - Castillian was the universal language they could all use to communicate.
2.Castllian was the language of the ruling elite, and was used by the local administration (political but also religious, the significance of the church here can not be overstated). It was also taught to the indigenous peoples of the conquered areas. Neither of those parties had real interest in learning or teaching other Iberic languages, outside of maybe individual cases - but to my knowledge there is nothing which would make it significant at a scale. 

In addition, later centuries only saw decreasing significance of the languages other than Castillian, especially following the incorporation of the Kingdom of Navarra. Over the centuries, due to immigration, groups of speakers of other languages - for example Basques - were formed in the colonies, but similarily to the processes we see in all most of emigration, were vanishing over time in favour of Castillian, either within the same generation or in the following ones."

AskHistorians,"As I understand, it's well-established that gunpowder and guns were invented in China. Why didn't this lead to a legacy of Chinese primacy in terms of innovation and dominance in firearms production?","This is a question that has perplexed many, and there is unlikely ever to be a perfect answer. What I will offer here is a summary of the chronology suggested by Tonio Andrade in *The Gunpowder Age*, one which many including myself have issues with, but where it is, on the whole, one of the only major attempts so far at covering the entire period in question *and* to offer structural explanations for Sino-European divergences.

Gunpowder was not originally understood as an explosive or a propellant, but rather as an incendiary. Different ratios of carbon, sulphur, and nitrate lead to different rates of combustion, and early Chinese formulations generally leaned towards slower and more exothermic mixtures rather than prioritising rapid gas release the way that a specifically propellant powder would. This function is also given away by the name – whereas English *gunpowder*, French *poudre à canon*, and German *Schießpulver* all highlight the use of gunpowder in firearms, Mandarin *huoyao* literally translates to 'fire medicine' or 'fire concoction', with its outright explosive properties being a later innovation. This would reach fruition in the fire-lance (*huoqiang*) in the 12th century, originally little more than a bomb on a stick, but made increasingly sophisticated, with some versions designed essentially as fragmentation devices, with metal, stone, or ceramic fragments wrapped around the explosive charge. But at this stage, the gun did not yet exist.

The gun, if defined as a reusable tube which uses a propellant charge to launch one or more projectiles, is first definitively attested in northwest China in the 1280s in the form of a small hand-cannon. These devices quite plausibly may have derived from experiments in making reusable fire-lances. But the gun also quickly found its way to Europe, quite probably via the Mongols, as guns of various sizes are attested in Europe by the 1330s, appearing in both textual and visual records, and would see considerable use throughout conflicts such as the Hundred Years' War. In short, any head start China had on firearms development quickly waned because guns were adopted in Europe without much delay.

What then needs explaining, though, is why Europe seems to have developed much more sophisticated firearms sooner. There are a number of possible arguments, some cultural and some material. Andrade's suggestion is what he calls the Chinese Wall Thesis: Chinese walls were generally earthworks several metres thick, which are hard to damage or destroy with siege equipment, and especially not by bombardment; in contrast, European walls were generally masonry works rarely more than 2m thick, and thus much less resistant to the sudden impacts of cannon shots. As such, European states developed more and more powerful cannon as a replacement for trebuchets to destroy walls, whereas that kind of incremental development couldn't get off the ground in China. Instead, gunpowder continued to be used for its incendiary properties, with mechanical engines like trebuchets used to lob burning projectiles over the walls and into the wooden structures behind them.

A potential quibble from the cultural side is that trebuchets had never been used to destroy the walls themselves, but rather protective structures *on top* of them like crenellations; that said, there is a reasonable suggestion that the ease with which cannons damaged crenellations would have been taken as a sign that the underlying structure might also be vulnerable, and as such the leap would not have been considerable.

However, Andrade suggests that East Asian states regained a level of parity with European gunpowder technology by about 1600. Importation and adaptation of Portuguese and Dutch firearms designs, combined with domestic innovations, gave the Ming Empire in China, the Joseon Kingdom of Korea, and the Japanese warlord regimes access to a variety of cutting-edge military tools. Not all used the same weapons to the same extent – the Ming prioritised artillery over small arms, Japan the reverse – but there was a stretch of time from, say, the mid-16th century down to the early 18th, when Europe and East Asia engaged in a sustained exchange of military expertise that allowed the latter to keep relatively up to date. This equipment would be put to use in a whole slew of conflicts that engulfed the region, from the Sengoku conflicts in Japan to Ming and Korean wars with tribal neighbours, climaxing with the 'Great East Asian War' of 1592-8 when Toyotomi Hideyoshi led most of Japan into a war with Korea in an attempt to conquer China. While peace reigned in Japan after the last few battles of the Sengoku Jidai in the 1610s, the Asian mainland would see the rise of the Qing Empire in the wake of the Japanese invasion, which secured Manchuria proper by the end of the 1620s, subjugated Korea in the 1630s, and conquered China proper in the 1640s-60s before turning its sights on the Eurasian steppe. Thus, Japan and Korea would fall somewhat behind as their untested militaries ceased to have a major role, but the Qing empire retained the impetus for reform and improvement.

The resumed divergence occurred with what he calls the 'Great Qing Peace', and this is where I have somewhat more quibbles. The suggestion is that prolonged peace in East Asia obviated the apparent necessity for military innovation, with the last of the major Qing campaigns being that against the Zunghars, concluding in 1757, and leading to a long period of relative peace until the Opium War in 1839-42 and the Taiping War in 1851-64. This extended peace meant that China simply no longer needed to develop new weapons or keep pace with Europe.

This I can see making sense for Japan and Korea, but for the Qing empire this falls a bit flat. Huge amounts of resources would be expended in campaigns in Burma in the 1760s, against the Jinchuan hill tribes in the 1770s, and against Vietnam in the 1780s, campaigns that were openly championed as demonstrations of the empire's martial credentials. And yet, the Qing do not appear to have invested considerably in the improvement of military equipment as a result. Nor is it intuitive that the earlier Zunghar campaigns *did* necessitate better weapons.

So, how do we explain a Qing-era divergence in military technology? One possibility is it was indeed a divergence in technical capacity, in terms of not only metallurgical techniques but also basic underlying skills such as technical drawing and ballistic measurement. But there are also institutional factors to consider: perhaps the Qing, whose regime was incredibly low-tax compared to Europe and lacked important financial instruments such as a national debt, simply could not afford such modernisation; or perhaps concerns over domestic upheaval and ethnic decline made the Qing state unwilling to issue better equipment to potentially unreliable Han Chinese soldiers, as well as prioritising more traditional arts, namely riding and archery, among the Manchu elite corps. 

In turn, if there are institutional arguments for why China and Europe diverged in terms of weapons technology from 1700 onward, this could be grounds for reappraising the divergence from c. 1400-1550 in more institutional terms. Whatever the case may be, the critical point is that a technological head start does not inherently last forever: as circumstances change, innovation may occur for some societies much more rapidly than others in the same timeframe."

AskHistorians,"Why is it that some countries use the "","" and ""."" as a decimal point and thousandth separator while other countries use the same two symbols to represent the opposite?","Wow, this is something I can actually comment on! I am a PhD in Applied Mathematics but have read a good deal of mathematical history. I am not a historian at all, but I can try to walk you through some of this history. I am largely taking from A History of Mathematical Notation by Florian Cajori in 1928.

Over the centuries, many cultures have decided on different ways to deal with the decimal separator (historically, albeit outdatedly, called the separatrix, as that means something very different now). Let's take the number 34.65 (or 34,65 in European nomenclature). In the Middle Ages, a bar ""¯"" was used separate the integer part and the decimal part (34¯65). There were also some more interesting ways to go about it, including just writing 3465, but with a bar over the 4. England eventually adopted the | symbol to represent this in writing, but for printing, this usually got shortened to a comma or decimal, similar to how the Arab mathematicians at the time were doing it (they were mainly using commas). Regardless, commas and periods started to become the dominant way, especially as mathematics was starting to make significant strides towards the unification of notation in the late 1600s, and early 1700s, which is where this diversion started to take place.

During the beginning of the 18th century however, things started to get complicated. Issac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both invented calculus around the same time, but they both started using different notations. Leibniz, a German, was widely respected. His mathematical notation was also widely respected, and whatever he did, people usually followed. At the beginning of the 18th century, Leibniz proposed to use the dot as a symbol of multiplication (5 · 2 = 10). This was then used in textbooks across mainland Europe, championed by Leibniz's good friend, Christian Wolf, who was a textbook writer. However, this did not go to England. The ""X"" symbol was generally preferred for multiplication, and therefore, the dot was not really outlawed for the separatrix. According to Cajori, about 60% of the textbooks in England were using the dot as the separatrix, while the other 40% were using the comma. But by the end of the century, almost none were using the comma.

Interestingly, there were some holdouts on Mainland Europe. Belgium and Italy were one of the last two countries with mathematicians that did not want to go away from the dot as the decimal separator. Eventually, they did cave.

This was the main turning point, as this meant that England (and then eventually America) would have this notation and Mainland Europe would be stuck with the comma as the decmial separator. That does not mean that others tried different techniques! From even the 1900s, there were the following options seen in different textbooks: 2.5 ; 2,5 ; 2'5 ; 2 (wedge) 5 ; 2.\_5, and so on."
AskHistorians,"The Nintendo Entertainment System and the FamilCom featured games so maddeningly difficult that the term ""Nintendo Hard"" persists to this day. Were there specific cultural, strategic, or other reasons that game designers chose to make NES/FC games so famously difficult?","Oh wow! I might actually have some useful insight on this: I did my master’s thesis on intense difficulty in video games. Ok, so arcade-era games had a profit model that meant that player failure = more quarters, so arcade games were made increasingly difficult to stay ahead of the difficulty curve for most players so that one player couldn’t monopolize a machine for hours on a single quarter. When the transition to home consoles began, there were a few elements that contributed to high difficulty as part of the design process:

1. Cartridges could hold data on the order of kilobytes: think a basic text file’s worth of data today. This led to a variety of shortcuts being used for efficiency, such as Super Mario Bros’ clouds and bushes being the same sprite with a different color palette. This also meant that designers were quite limited in the amount of “content” (levels, enemy types, etc) they could pack into a single cartridge. How do you stop a player from blowing thru all of your game quickly? Make it harder. 

2. Games were released FAR less frequently than they are today. You could go months between game releases in the NES era. So designers not only had limited data to work with but they needed to make their games LAST bc if you finish a game in a couple weeks, you’re left without a new game to play until the next one comes out…assuming it’s even a game you’re interested in. Increased difficulty = longer shelf life for your game.

3. Game designers are, by the very work they engage in, quite good at games. So there’s also a bias for making harder games bc designers’ ideas of “difficult” could sometimes be desynced from the average consumer’s skill floor.

4. Many game designers have said that they weren’t even sure IF their games could be beaten, just that they trusted that someone would figure it out. It’s not impossible that a dev team never beat their own game even if players eventually would. This was a wild thing to learn during my research and feels quite surprising to me!

5. Gaming publications (magazines and strategy guides) were a booming industry that helped advertise the latest releases. Part of their appeal was to sell secrets: tips on how to beat difficult games, cheat codes, etc. See Mia Consalvo’s *Cheating* ch1 for more details on this particular trend. If your game is difficult, you’re more likely to get some coverage since players are more likely to want to read about how to beat your game (and so they can gain social capital/gaming capital for that secret knowledge within their own gaming circles)

6. Again, RE:Consalvo’s work, gamers were more likely to talk about a difficult game among their friends as they struggled to play and sought secret knowledge that would help them improve. Word of mouth is a powerful form of advertisement, so you want players discussing strategy and tactics as much as possible! Hard games get talked about more because there is more struggle!

If you’d like some further reading on the subject, I suggest Mia Consalvo’s *Cheating* (as mentioned above) and the work of Jesper Juul: *The Art of Failure* and *The Casual Revolution* were SOOOOOO useful for learning more about this. You might also want to check out Tristan Donovan’s *Replay* as well, as it is a pretty comprehensive accounting of game history generally. Big fan.

I’m on mobile, but if folks have trouble finding any of these books let me know. I can format full citations after I’ve had some coffee 😅 I’m also down to answer questions to the best of my ability, though I’m traveling some today so I might not get to you immediately! I teach digital humanities courses at a Big 10 university and one of my main research interests is game studies. While I am a rhetorician and not a historian, I hope that this helps you understand the reasons behind difficulty in game design during this fascinating era of game history!

AskHistorians,"How does one become a court jester during the medieval period? Also, is Crusader Kings II and Crusader Kings III right to portray it as an undesirable job?","Depends on the period you're thinking of.

I'll speak to English history specifically since that's what I'm familiar with, but for the majority of the medieval period, court jesters were most often called fools.

(Among others, the Latin term 'joculator' was also used and is closer in literal meaning to jester, but what we mean when we say 'jester' is really a court fool. Joculator, mimus, etc. were all vaguer terms that could mean multiple things.)

Although the link between folly/intellectual disability and court spectacle had a long prehistory stretching back to classical antiquity, fooling as a medieval profession did not emerge until the 12th century. Prior to that, kings' retainers and brothers-in-arms who served as entertainers might have cropped up here and there in the historical record, but that wasn't their primary role. Professional minstrels would also pass through the king's halls and deliver entertainment that included jokes—these were sometimes the joculatores I mentioned above, and we start seeing them mentioned in the 11th century—but they were not a permanent fixture of courtly life.

The term 'fool' became firmly attached to certain members of the royal entourage in the 12th century, but at the time, they retained additional positions such as houndmaster, messenger, hunter or even in some cases sergeant or knight. So at this point in time it could be said that you became the king's fool by performing for him at certain times (particularly around Christmas), but that alone was not enough to justify your place in the royal household and you still had to serve the king in multiple ways.

An example from around this time would be Roland the Farter, who received a sergeantry from Henry II and the condition for keeping it was that he would appear at Henry's Christmas feast every year and perform ""a leap, a whistle and a fart."" You can find a reference in Robert Bartlett's *England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings*, which is an excellent overview of the cultural and political history of the entire period.

(Popular websites love the story of Roland, so you can find summaries of it in many places online, but as far as I can tell, they all introduce him as a professional flatulist whose only job was to fart on Christmas. That's extremely unlikely; the estate he received from Henry was too valuable for that, and moreover, if he really was a professional farter whose work so amused the king, surely he would have been required to perform more frequently than once a year. It's more likely that he was a regular member of the royal household who became famous for his farting performances at feasts and Henry incorporated a reference to his party tricks in the terms of Roland's land tenure because, well, the king could do that.)

Later on—around the 13th century—we start to see a shift from members of the royal household serving as fools in addition to performing their other duties to kings hiring minstrels, actors, acrobats, etc. to provide that service at court. Fooling became a type of professional performance. Kings would still keep fools, but these people were now more likely to be professional minstrels specialising in fooling, OR to be genuinely intellectually disabled people who had been specially procured for the king in some way. (We have extremely little information on how exactly this happened, which is, I realise, the crux of your question.) We also get references to lesser nobles and even wealthy commoners keeping fools in their households. The line between performance and intellectual disability looks very blurry from the distance of time and it's hard to say which of these fools were acting and which weren't. What's clear is that they were all kept on for a weird combination of reasons: to provide entertainment, because fools were supposed to say and do really silly things that were funny to regular people (as conventional wisdom had it at the time), and also for charity and to humble their masters by reminding them of the transience of worldly riches. At this time, most Christian theologists considered intellectually disabled people to be untouched by vices like greed and pride, so they served as examples of spiritual purity and a direct connection to the divine in addition to being the butt of many jokes. Again, it was a weird mix of cultural attitudes.

Kings in particular loved to laugh, so their fools at least were, whatever their mental capacity, likely to be skilled at different forms of live entertainment: pranks, skits, impressions, dancing, acrobatics, juggling, music, knife-throwing, etc. They were often made to dress up as knights, or the king, or various animals, and pretend to be those things—but in an obviously 'foolish' way, which made it funny. They sung irreverent songs, ran naked through the halls, made huge messes at dinner, kicked and bit fussy officials who annoyed the king, etc. As opposed to the earlier figure of the fool as an otherwise ordinary member of the royal household who occasionally performed funny songs/party tricks, the fool who emerged in the 13th century was a full-time entertainer. Again, some fools were at the very least believed by their contemporaries to be intellectually disabled, but many weren't, and all seem to have been trained in the performing arts. So, to finally give you an answer, they were often recruited from acting troupes and minstrel guilds, or perhaps they were picked up on the street because of their disability and then they were given the training they needed to become court fools. France was the European capital of minstrelsy and all manner of aristocratic indulgence in the 13th and 14th centuries, so many of the famous fools of this period came from there.

(As an aside, I'll say court fools almost always used pseudonyms/performing names instead of their real names. For example, there were several fools in the service of the English royal family during the reigns of Edward II and Edward III who were called Robert le Fol, which has always reminded me of the practice of giving consecutive pets the same name. This detail speaks to both the constructed nature of medieval court fools' personas and the power kings had to construct said personas.)

The ratio of disabled to non-disabled fools is a question several historians have tried to answer, but there is really no way to settle it; I personally think the majority of court fools who became famous enough to appear in the historical record must have been able to exercise some measure of deliberate control over their careers and had rare skills that took training to acquire—neither of which is incompatible with having an intellectual disability, to be sure—and more generally that the majority of professional fools in the 13th through 16th centuries were performers because we get a few contemporary polemics against the immoral practice of feigning intellectual disability for entertainment. However, I also suspect quite a few intellectually disabled people were taken into rich merchant and aristocratic households and made to inhabit the role of a household fool, sometimes against their will and perhaps with varying levels of understanding of what was expected of them, which sounds like a really sad fate to me (though perhaps no sadder than many contemporary alternatives).

A final note on disability here: in the medieval medical and moral imagination, intellectual disability was linked to physical irregularities such as hypercephaly (having a giant head), dwarfism, deformities and even abnormally large genitalia. So sometimes people with such physical characteristics, especially dwarfs, were recruited and trained as fools. We also know about a number of famous dwarf acrobats and dancers across England and France from this period who were not professional fools but simply general entertainers, often travelling as part of an acting troupe or accompanying a famous fool or minstrel. And sometimes they secured permanent positions in royal and aristocratic households the way fools did (but were, again, not always called fools). There seems to be some kind of correlation in the sources between fools/entertainers with dwarfism and female aristocratic patrons, but that's just my personal observation."
AskHistorians,"What really happened at Saturn, GM’s radical project to reinvent the small car and the car buying experience?","Iran in the 1970s managed to get a large influx of money due to the Shah's effort to push exports of
oil. This threw a lifeline to the United States, stunned by the oil shortages of the early 70s. Simultaneous with this,
discontent in Iran was brewing, people upset with the monarchy for multiple reasons, including oppression by the secret
police, the SAVAK. Continuous open protests broke out from 1978 (a January protest, attended by thousands,
had five people killed by forces of the shah, only making things worse) up to early 1979 (""DOWN WITH THE SHAH
THE BLOOD-SUCKER""), eventually leading to the weighty day of January 16, 1979 where the Shah and Empress Farah took a 
plane out of the country, reportedly for an ""extended vacation"". According to the Associated Press reporting:

>Horns honked, bakers gave away free cakes and cookies, and Iranians dumped candy into passing cars. They sprinkled each other with rosewater as they heard that the shah had slipped out of the country and flown to Egypt.

All this eventually led to the hostage crisis in November, but even prior to that, the spigot was closed: Ayatollah Khomeini
came to power and cut oil production.

Consumer confidence in US cars, already shaken, took a nosedive: people started to snap up
smaller cars with better mileage, as built by the Japanese. According to Robert Dallon, former
chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association:

>There were 100,000 Datsuns on the docks at Los Angeles [a brand owned by Nissan]. Datsun 
dealers were coming to us, worried about inventory. Ninety days later, that inventory had evaporated. 
Overnight, the demand changed to small cars.

While GM and Ford didn't suffer as badly as Chrysler (which nearly went under and needed 
to be bailed out by a government loan), concern over the Japanese and their compact, 
lower-gas-use cars became a dominant theme through the 1980s.

Saturn under GM was conceived with a small car study in 1982 in order to address the problem head-on. The name
came from the Saturn NASA missions, with a prototype being built in 1984.

Being a company crafted essentially from scratch, a new plant was custom-built after a country-wide
search; GM was courted heavily by various states (with tax breaks and free power offered) but they
eventually settled on Spring Hill, Tennessee in 1985 (due to, according to the GM CEO, ""pro-business 
climate and its hardworking labor force""). Ground was broken in 1986, with roughly $2b spent on a new plant.

Rewinding a little, one of the important aspects in all this is
a study written by request for GM by Morris Cohen (Wharton) and Hau Lee (Stanford), both professors
specializing in operations. Management was initially not interested but
one of the set ""the 99"" eventually chosen for spearheading Saturn thought
the idea had worth: supply chain control, now known as TQM, Total
Quality Management. The idea here is to control vertically as many
parts of the parts-to-dealer experience is possible, in order to
enable efficiency and consistent consumer experiences. A parts availability
survey (from Parts Monitor, 1999) rated Saturn as the most likely
to have off-the-shelf availability of needed parts for repairs.

The plant, being built from scratch, also was made to facilitate
this. While early automobile manufacturing (that is, from the 20s)
tended to have all parts made in the same location, this became
more difficult as cars became more complicated and manufacturers
needed to react to trends quickly. The Saturn line was built from
the ground up for flexibility, so they could, say, switch from
making predominantly automatic transmissions to predominantly
manual transmissions if there was a shortage.

For this to work, there needed additionally to be agreements with dealers.
Since the network also was being started from scratch, GM could dictate the terms:
dealers were each given a wide area with the promise that no other dealers
would be in the same area. This allowed for the famous ""no-haggle"" policy;
dealers were not tempted to undercut each other to attract a
potential buyer from the next lot over. Prices could be advertised
nationally; used sales could be done directly at Blue Book cost.

On top of all this -- even prior to factory groundbreaking -- was a union agreement that allowed for [fuller worker integration into the process](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/07/27/gm-saturn-pact-gives-uaw-role-in-management/58801ef7-45c9-44ed-b914-0d17e6faa038/):

>The union will be represented at all levels of the organization . . . and we'll participate in all the decisions at all levels.

This idea was a carry-over from Nissan, also building a plant in Tennessee. [As reported in 1983 of Nissan's operation](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/04/business/nissan-uses-japan-s-ways-in-tennessee.html):

>One of the main considerations in selecting workers for the Tennessee operation, Mr. Runyon said, has been the applicants' willingness to go along with ''the participative management that we will use at the operation.''

Saturn's innovation was making the agreement from the ground-up with the union.

Advertising (created by Hal Riney & Partners, who also did the famous Gallo wine ads of the 80s) emphasized building a personal relationship with the customer, pitching Saturn specifically to those people who had fled gas-guzzling US cars for imports. [This ad from 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fx_fsgqBrM) talks about the cars being ""made from scratch in this country"" and emphasizes the reliability.

Having said all that, we don't quite have to get all the way to the 2010 (when the brand was officially closed) to discuss the downfall a little. Car sales of Saturn peaked at 1994; the only years they did not fall were ones where they introduced a new model. The slow introduction of models is likely where Saturn went wrong: they stuck for essentially a decade to the ""compact car"" sales notion built out of the crisis of 1979, but this wasn't true any more in the 1990s, and while they did eventually release the Vue in 2002, that was too late, and people who had been jumping ship for a decade to larger cars.

Out of the Saturn innovations, the one most picked up by
other companies is TQM, although not all companies had the same level of success. The issue is that Saturn was building the entire pipeline from building to consumer from the ground up, but changing an already existing structure is much harder. Caterpillar tried
the TQM strategy but never managed to get the same level of dealer confidence that came
out of Saturn.

As far as the Union agreement of Japanese-style labor-management unity with Saturn goes, that didn't even last until the end; GM management started to enforce more influence as the 90s went on, leading to [a strike in 1998](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1998/07/23/gm-plans-to-bring-saturn-into-the-fold/c823ec78-7a1a-4ade-a766-67b4624100e1/). As a UAW bargaining chairman is quoted:

>We cannot continue to live a lie that this partnership is alive and healthy and well when it is not.

The Saturn workers were folded into the general UAW union agreement in 2003, essentially striking that strategy defunct.

AskHistorians,"Recent increase in holocaust denial, apparently only 280,000 Jews died in Nazi Concentration camps according to a supposed Red Cross document stating so. What facts prove this to be untrue?","One thing that I *think* might be happening is that the document in question is talking about death certificates issued for *concentration* camps, which were different camps from *extermination* camps. The latter were the sites where the vast majority of victims were killed, with the second biggest number murdered in shooting operations. 

The distinctions between the two often get lost because the Auschwitz complex had both: Auschwitz I and Auschwitz III Monowitz were concentration camps (ie, they kept prisoners there for slave labor, such as at the synthetic rubber plant constructed at Auschwitz III), while Auschwitz II-Birkenau was an extermination camp - the vast majority of people were sent there to be immediately murdered. 

Just looking at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum [figures](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/documenting-numbers-of-victims-of-the-holocaust-and-nazi-persecution), this actually would seem to line up with the 280,000 concentration camp death certificates figures, as it lists at least 150,000 killed in concentration camps, but also treats the whole Auschwitz complex as a single figure (so presumably the over 1 million killed is for both the extermination camp and the concentration camps there).

Also speaking of those USHMM figures, including other groups persecuted in addition to Jews puts their total around or a little over the 17 million figure cited already."
AskHistorians,Is there a reason why many Hollywood films from the 30’s and 40’s ended so abruptly?," 

The origin of this abrupt end seems to be a backlash against conventional narrative structures developed in the 19th century. This actually originated with theater criticism, primarily William Archer, which repudiated well-made plays, or plays that followed standard narrative structures. 

Archer may not have necessarily started this “revolt” against well-made plays, but he was certainly emblematic of it. He refused to use the terms “denouement” or “catastrophe,” terms referring to post-climax acts in standard narrative structures. Archer was even disdainful of the Aristotelian concept of a beginning, middle, and end.

The words of the critics reached the playwrights, and by proxy, the film directors. Contemporary conventions talked about reducing “important coincidences,” or plot resolutions, and having continuous, escalating action. Thus, ending at the climax would have been encouraged, as most of the events after the climax would be those “important coincidences” and the climax represented the peak of the action.

There was also a technical consideration. In 1908, film producers standardized film length at 1000 feet, so the running time was suddenly restricted. Combined with the rhetoric around the non-necessity of an ending, many early films decided to “chop off” their endings to satisfy this standardization. Subsequent films in the 30s and 40s likely followed the convention of their predecessors, even when they could plan around those standards 

Of course, the traditional denouements and epilogues were still around. One critic complained of both abrupt endings and of excessively long conclusions.

AskHistorians,I'm a lazy novelist in the time before r/AskHistorians. How do I get someone to do my research for me?,"Alexandre Dumas was able to employ a number of assistants, notably  Auguste Maquet, to do ghost writing for him for 18 novels. Maquet's exact role was debated- fiercely debated- but he could both research ( he was trained as a historian, unlike Dumas) and could write. He also felt he was entitled to royalties for what he'd done; though a French court did not agree.

But some people just want their story to be known, and work for free. John Jacob Astor became wealthy from the fur trade, and readily gave Washington Irving access to journals and papers. Irving also pumped his nephew Pierre for information to write a glowing history of Astor's venture, *Astoria*. But Irving was not a thief: he would actually pay $1,000 for the papers and journals of another explorer, Benjamin Bonneville, to write his *The Adventures of Captain Bonneville*.

James Fennimore Cooper would extensively use the journal of Thomas Ordway, one of the members of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery, in writing his Leatherstocking Tales. In this case, Ordway was never paid- but as he died in 1817 he wasn't able to complain to Cooper."
AskHistorians,The new game “Pentiment” features a 15th century Bavarian town very much in touch with its pagan past. How realistic is that depiction?,"The answers by u/Steelcan909 and u/Kelpie-Cat are both brilliant answers in their own rights that set the stage around Tassing-Kiersau really well. That being said, they are general answers, not answers about *Pentiment*, and the game has some particulars that are really interesting and worth digging into in specific detail. In short, while the scholarly consensus is trending towards thinking about the ""pagan"" figures in the game as fairly late inventions in a Christian milieu, it is quite likely that people in the period would have *thought* these were pagan

For anyone visiting the thread, obviously, spoilers for *Pentiment* below. 

**Frau Perchta**

The main ""pagan"" (in this context, non-Roman non-Christian) being referred to in the game is Frau Perchta (""The Bright Lady""). Also called Berchta, Bertha, or a bunch of other names, she's a folkloric figure strongly associated with midwinter and the Wild Hunt. This puts her in a camp really similar to Frau Holle in northern Germany, Herla in Old English, and Odin in Scandinavia. For all of these except Odin, there's also a pretty transparent linguistic connection, which suggests a really ancient origin in Germanic traditions. On these grounds, Jakob Grimm asserted in *Deutsche Mythologie* that Frau Perchta was an exceedingly ancient Alpine goddess. This stance does persist into the present, with works like Lecouteux's *Phantom Armies of the Night* continuing to propose that the Wild Hunt, its leaders, and traditions around it (like the Perchtenlauf!) are very ancient.

There has been a lot of pushback, though, as Grimm's pan-Germanic ethnonationalist tendencies have come under criticism and we've revisited the various folk traditions in question. There isn't a current consensus, but scholars like JB Smith argue strongly that Perchta the Belly-slitter is in fact a folk derivation from ""The Bright Day,"" more familiarly known as Epiphany. In this argument, she is formulated as the post-Christmas parallel to St. Lucia, whose feast day is in mid-December and is the center of a lot of different folk traditions.

If we look less at the figure and more at the practices, the game centers on two main events: the St. John's Bonfire and the Perchtenlauf. While Perchta is not associated with midsummer at all, the St. John's bonfire absolutely is a real thing, as is passing around or through a fire for the sake of scaring off wicked spirits. The oldest one I have been able to find continuously practiced is an annual tradition in Slovenia that started in the 18th century, but much earlier sources still associate June 24th with fire across Europe. Additionally, the fact that the villagers go forth to gather herbs is spot-on; Albrecht Altdorf, an artist from Reginsburg, made paintings of John the Baptist with strong botanical significance in 1512. 

The Perchtenlauf is also something portrayed really well in-game. The Perchtenlauf, or the Krampuslauf, or Krampusnacht, is still an annual festival in Austria and southern Germany where people dress up in hair or wicker garmets and masks before running through the streets, and the traditions go back to at least the later 1500s.

As usual, though, we run into trouble with identifying whether these are *pagan*. They're definitely widespread, and they're definitely weird, but those don't automatically make something pagan. Ultimately, I think it can be persuasively argued either way, and that ambiguity is kind of the point.

**The Bowl**

In the final act of the game, one of the things we do in an abandoned salt mine is reconstruct a bowl. Magda immediately asserts that this is [Frau Perchta and a human sacrifice ritual,](https://youtu.be/c4SVU0DSKTk?t=11750) but nothing in the game confirms it (the link is to my own playthrough of the game, at the relevant moment. it's the only good image of the bowl I can find...). Stylistically, the striped outfits of the figures strongly remind me of the [Gundestrup Cauldron](https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/Gundestrup-Cauldron-horned-figure.jpg), which is a pre-Roman object but is from a very different place. If anyone else has closer parallels, I definitely encourage sharing them below. The other material referenced by Black Til or found in the mine, including an amber bear, are well-attested in Central Europe from the Mesolithic into the Roman Iron Age.

**Ambiguity and Memory**

So far, our analysis has focused on evaluating whether the game is right according to modern knowledge, and it's been ambiguous. However, as the other answers here have highlighted, in the Middle Ages people had a different relationship with paganism! It is not contradictory to say that Frau Perchta is not pre-Christian and to say that Ill Peter thinks it she is. u/Kelpie-Cat's answer is much more thorough than anything I could write here, so I'll refer you to her work for more on that interplay of anthropology, community memory, and history.

What I want to dwell on instead, getting at it from a different angle, is why the mastermind of the entire game's plot is terrified that people will find out. The reason has a lot to do with how medieval literatii understood knowledge production. At the core of medieval philosophy is the idea of *auctoritas*, or ""authority."" In particular, medieval people valued either respected Classical figures or major figures in the Church as the foundations of their work. Knowledge is produced by reading these figures, copying them, contemplating them, and writing elaborate commentaries of these texts. These commentaries would then be debated in monasteries and communities, certain interpretations would be accepted as canonical, and then the whole process iterates. We see that a little bit in the game when Werner and the other Italian doctors are talking about Pliny the Elder and whether it is worth rejecting that text for being, well, wrong. about a lot of things.

For the mastermind, then, the *Historia Tassiae* is effectively a definitive proof, thanks to a lot of *auctoritas* derived from its status as a chronicle, that St. Moritz was never in Tassing. They frame the danger as causing a crisis of faith, but this also is an economic catastrophe for the town as it would likely massively affect the pilgrimage route into town. In short, the fear is that it reframes the pilgrimage practice of the community from being self-perceived as ""Christian"" to self-perceived as ""un-Christian,"" thereby dooming everyone's souls.

The self-perception is, in short, the primary thing that matters, and the game does an excellent job creating a self-perception for the people of Tassing that matches late medieval discourses.

AskHistorians,Why were there no financial crises in the world after WWII until the 70s?,"Your question is a bit misleading, because the crisis that hit in the 1970s wasn't just a normal crisis, but in fact formally ended the entire paradigm of metal-backed currencies and ushered in today's floating-rate exchange system. So while the 30 year period from ~1945 to 1971 didn't have a ""financial crisis"" per se, the tensions building up within the Bretton Woods system were so severe as to permanently end the entire prevailing macroeconomic paradigm. While 2008 basically changed nothing in our macroeconomic approach, save some semi-toothless regulations (Hi Dodd-Frank), the 1971-83 (in the US) crisis permanently changed the entire macro landscape. 

In other words, the era we think of as remarkably placid was in fact accumulating massive tensions which would eventually force gigantic changes in the global macro environment which nobody really expected. So it wasn't as calm and wonderful as we tend to think.

That aside, there were some financial crises during that period as countries adjusted to the post-war environment. The US had a post-war recession, as did several other places. They weren't severe, to finally get to your question, because the US acted as a global (mostly) lender of last resort. 

The Bretton Woods system was called the dollar-gold system, which I think is a better term because it describes how the system worked. The US dollar was formally backed by gold, meaning that hypothetically one could walk into a bank, exchange dollars for their equivalent in gold (at that time, $35/oz), and walk out. During the Great Depression, FDR ended consumer convertibility but left it intact for foreign governments and central banks. During the war, many central banks and central governments moved their gold reserves to NY Fed, whose vaults are quite large, nice, air-conditioned, and rather far from Nazi Germany which regularly pillaged the gold holdings of the countries it conquered. Greece, for example, is still considering a lawsuit against Germany for the value of the gold stolen from its vaults.

Sometimes those movements were done under secrecy and with quite a bit of wartime drama, especially with the French gold which had to be secreted out very quickly given the shocking speed of the 1940 Blitzkreig. After the war, and after occupied countries had been liberated and their gold reserves re-credited to them by the NY Fed - the NY Fed wasn't going to allow Vichy France to access Republican France's gold, obviously - the end result was that a bunch of countries had a bunch of gold sitting safely in NY.

Instead of moving this gold around - physically expensive - countries instead just started fixing their currencies to the dollar. This made sense, because the dollar was currently flooding all of western europe via the Marshall Plan (among others); one thing crypto people always ignore about money is that it must, above all things, be readily available and commonly-used, and the dollar was both readily available in post-war Europe and commonly-used because nobody knew what their domestic currency's actual market price should be given wartime disruptions / liberations.

The result was called the dollar-gold standard, because everyone but the US linked to the dollar, and the dollar linked to gold. Because the amount of dollars which could be printed by the Fed was (in theory!) limited by the amount of gold the Fed had on hand, and because lots of places had sent their gold to the US, the US could print lots and lots of dollars. And it did so, happily.

The resulting system worked fairly smoothly. Any macroeconomic adjustments which needed to take place were mediated via the central banks, which cooperated by coordinating interest rate changes as required under the gold regime. However, because countries enacted capital controls as part of Bretton Woods - basically making international movements of capital by private capital more expensive - they were relatively insulated from market pressures on their exchange rates. When adjustment was required, the relevant central bank could simply adjust their peg to the dollar - instead of gold - via a stroke of the pen, allowing for macro adjustments without the corresponding gold flows which had proven so incredibly destabilizing during the 1920s. 

Without going into detail on the inherent instability of the global gold standard, Bretton Woods was aimed at preventing or at least slowing down rapid movements of capital across borders because, under the gold standard, those sorts of rapid movements were both common and incredibly destabilizing, both monetarily and politically. Keynes was among those who thought the political instability caused by those rapid movements was to blame for the political radicalization of the 30s. Bretton Woods aimed to stop that by making it difficult for private actors to move money internationally.

Bretton Woods therefore allowed countries more domestic flexibility by insulating them from market pressures. The situation worked relatively well, for as long as everyone trusted their currencies could still be converted into dollars, and then from dollars into gold. This was the case through the mid-1960s, at which point the French started wondering just how much gold the NY Fed actually had sitting in those vaults. Doubting that they could actually exchange their Francs for dollars and then gold at the official rates, the French started pulling their gold out of the American financial system. When LBJ and then Nixon expanded the Vietnam war without increasing revenues - meaning that, under gold standard rules, gold would be leaving the American system, making it less likely that the dollar-gold peg of $35/oz could be maintained - the French grew more concerned and accelerated the rate of their withdrawals. 

As a result of Vietnam and the French pressure, Nixon was forced to choose  between maintaining the Bretton Woods dollar-gold paradigm by hiking taxes during a recession, which also likely meant a humiliating end to the Vietnam War, or his political future (or, if we're not as cynical as me, ""what was best for the country""). He chose to continue the war, didn't hike taxes, ended the peg, and the formality of dollar-gold conversion ended. The resulting readjustments, compounded by the oil crisis and stagflation of the late 70s, took a good decade plus to really reverberate around the world until a new macroeconomic paradigm centered on floating currencies and independent central banks took hold. 

We live in the residue of that system today, although it has been radically changed since 2008 and especially post-covid. The paradigm of independent central banks focused on price stability has, in my opinion, seriously eroded in the last decade. We still have people saying that central bank independence (CBI) is absolutely necessary for economic growth, despite the fact that the most independent central banks (ECB) are doing all kinds of things that CBI logic says they shouldn't. I wrote my master's thesis on this topic, and think we're basically undergoing a new paradigm shift in central banking and possibly the global macro picture at present. But I digress.

In sum, I would answer your question by saying the following:

1. Bretton Woods wasn't as stable as we think; it was accumulating massive pressures beneath the surface that erupted dramatically in the 70s. The financial crisis that hit then wasn't just a normal financial crisis, because it changed the entire global macroeconomic paradigm from fixed-peg to today's floating-rate system.
2. Bretton Woods did create some stability, but that stability was based on trust in the US. That trust was never going to last forever, and in hindsight it is probably remarkable that it actually lasted as long as it did. BW was inevitably going to fail.

AskHistorians,"In 1963, Japanese singer Kyu Sakamoto's ""Sukiyaki"" became a surprise number one hit in the United States, the only Japanese song to top the chart. How did this happen? Was there an interest in Japanese culture at the time, or was the song just an anomaly?","After WWII was over, the Americans didn't leave Japan; the US stayed officially as an occupation until 1952, and even after that the US maintained (and still maintains) a military presence.

This meant the Japanese getting exposed to lots of American culture, spreading out of military bases. The rockabilly genre, combining country and blues, originated on the US side in the early 50s and spread over the Pacific, as Japanese singers tried to copy the songs the best they could, including southern accents. The first cowboy groups formed in Japan, doing Japanese covers of US songs, including a smash-hit version of Heartbreak Hotel in 1956 ([which you can listen to here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4ToTNFGNPA); the channel has lots more Japanese music of the 50s).

Various people vied for the title of ""Japanese Elvis"", and February 1958 was the origin of the First Nichigeki Western Carnival, with wild musicians in the vein of Elvis and fainting fans. Teenagers were thrilled. Elders were not. Quoting the sociologist Shibusawa Hideo:

>rockabilly singers are the preachers of a strange new faith; the low teens are the faith’s blind worshippers.

_Time Magazine_ ran a 1958 article on Three Rockabilly Men (Masaaki Hirao, Keijiro Yamashita, and Mickey Curtis) and was less than impressed, the article itself titled _Rittoru Dahring_ as a parody of the rockabilly pronunciation of _Little Darling_. It also goes on to quote more unimpressed Japanese elders who characterize the singing as ""apelike mumblings.""

By 1961, Japanese rockabilly was starting to run out of steam; this was when Sakamoto Kyū released a cover of _G.I. Blues_ (originally sung by his idol, Elvis). This was his first single under his own name (he had prior records as Danny Iida and the Paradise Kings) and it was the one that solidified his name, once as for all, as the Real Japanese Elvis. He took on Elvis's vocal stylings as close as possible, including slurring. The setting is somewhat changed (the original is about at homesick GI in Germany; this version changes the occupation to be that Japan) but it was otherwise unironic. However, just like all the other Japanese rockabilly music, it was slightly distorted enough that it wouldn't sell back to a US audience (the music was firmly Elvis's, anyway).

Later that year he did the single _Ue wo muite arukō_, translatable as _I Will Keep
My Head Up as I Walk_. He still sticks with some of both Elvis-style and rockabilly style, in particular doing a last syllable ""hiccup"": ""arukō-wo-wo-wo"".

This was the song later that hit #1 on Billboard in the summer of '63 in the US as _Sukiyaki_. It is unclear where the title came from; an interview with Sakamoto claims there was a British DJ who only knew the words ""fujiyama, geisha, and sukiyaki"" and picked it based on that. It had a European '62 release first and essentially spread virally between DJs of radio stations, eventually picked up by US west coast DJs by early '63.

It eventual reach to Gold Record sales let one critic to comment ""our eighteen years of struggle in the postwar period have not been in vain"". Sakamoto had a triumphant showing on _The Steve Allen Playhouse_ (and almost _Ed Sullivan_ too, but he had a conflict with filming a movie) where he went from his rockabilly image (which would have been a turn-off, see the _Time_ article) to ballad crooner, and there was the strong hope that Sakamoto could release another hit after.

Despite glowing profiles and brief celebrity, the second hit didn't land, _Shina No Yoru_ (""China Nights"") only made it to #58 on the charts. In the US, at least, he was a one-hit wonder.

For the reason of success with the first song and not the second: oddly, the first single did _not_ win the Nippon Record Taisho award, which might be a given (as it had ample sales); it used, like a great deal of Japanese popular music, a pentatonic scale, but it was in a major key rather than a minor key, which was thought to make the song sound more Western. [If you listen to the track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_WuE_AV6kg), despite being fairly obviously Japanese, it is Japanese-Elvis-analogue; if you take [the followup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaqBIDuQFrA), it dives fully into a more obviously-Asian style.

Also, _Shina No Yoru_ didn't have the time to land organically like the hit did -- the pressure was on to _construct_ a hit which can be pressure for even the most talented artist.

In other words: the flashpoint of the 1963 #1 was because

a.) Sakamoto genuinely perfected a style approaching Elvis, based on music influences of the 50s coming from US military bases

b.) it had some Western imitation elements but wasn't so close to seem like parody (_Rittoru Dahring_)

c.) it appealed in Europe enough to cause a natural growth in popularity

d.) yet it was close enough to familiar Western tunes to be approachable, moreso than the follow-up.

So yes, it was some Orientalism, but not in a way that was perceived as heavy; that is, it was encapsulated in a way that was Western-friendly.

""Baltic Soviet Republics were explicitly an experiment in a reversal of the traditional imperial flow of resources away from the periphery and onto the metropole. Instead, they were “showcase republics,” whose industry catapulted fifteen times over their own past levels, and that of other Soviet republics, in the postwar era. These countries were also spared from cultural repression, with banned books and exiled writers freely available as resources denied elsewhere in the USSR."" How true is this?"
AskHistorians,"Was there an equivalent to ""start-ups"" in socialist countries? How would an employee/factory director who had an idea for new product or method for producing go about it? Did they submit applications to State planners or ministries and State funded it?","There were no start-ups in the Soviet Union. Trotski 
and Bukharin rejected the idea of a labour 
market, substituting it with a militarization of 
labor. This made the state the only recognized 
legal employer. There were some limited reforms over the decades, but the basic template remained, meaning you didn't just start your own business to compete against other companies. By the 
1980s there were only 2 main retail networks, 1 airline company, 1 oil-extraction ministerial monopoly, and 9 ministerial concerns in defense industries. A not super rigorous but still useful introduction is [this 1995 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40228791).

In reality, rather than speak of entrepreneurs and startups, you had intrapreneurs, working within the strict constraints of a universal state monopoly, potentially creating not new businesses, but new administrative units. These could be party figures, scientists, and even Gulag R&D labour camps. The latter,  called sharahka, were R&D prisons, where scientific convicts were tasked with designing innovations for the state. They were spared hard labour, and successful researchers could even receive medals from the state. This is a good basic intro: www.rbth.com/history/332537-how-convicts-designed-soviet-weapon/amp. This is the most extreme illustration of the dynamics of intrapreneurship and innovation in the Soviet Union. You could not be an entrepreneur or create an independent start-up, but you could be an intrapreneur innovating in the framework of the political, military and economic interests of the state/Party, and earn, not money primarily, but political/administrative autonomy and scope, even in prison, which were the real currencies in the Soviet economy.


If an innovator/intrapreneur had an idea, yes they had to pitch it up the Party/state hierarchy, and only once they has convinced the right ministry that they were worth implementing could their initiative be rolled out, from the centre. Innovations, for example in military or space technology or industrial processes, were largely state directed and assigned to bureaucratic ministries, and new ideas had to receive Gosplan approval (USSR State Committee on Planning).

Gosplan itself provides an excellent illustration of the process of Soviet innovation and entrepreneurship, detailed in [this excellent paper](https://ifip.hal.science/IFIP-AICT-549/hal-02386537) on the creation and deployment of its first state computer, shifting the entire planning of the Soviet economy from a command driven to a data driven paradigm. You can see the sequence of ideation, political selling, leadership buy-in, and large scale implementation. 

A more detailed glimpse into scientific intrapreneurialism is [this fascinating deep dive](https://ifip.hal.science/IFIP-AICT-549/hal-02386542) into two of the pioneers of Russian computer science. You can see the process of getting to test and apply ideas for innovations. One of the innovators reads a Western text on cybernetics in a secret library in the Artilliery Military Academy in 1951 (cybernetics was considered a pseudo science by the state at this time). He then incorporates these ideas in his own sphere of influence, while publishing in the main ideological journal and giving lectures in Moscow, leading to promotions and the authority to implement his ideas on a bigger scale, with further publications and lectures and networking. 

These two I think are excellent examples of the dynamics of innovation and intrapreneurship in the Soviet Union. 

Where in the West that computer might have been built and promoted and sold, in the Soviet Union it was politically sold and promoted, but then tested at a scale most Western entrepreneurs would dream of for their very first iteration. The state was the sole Venture Capital funder, and evaluated the proposed ventures for political, then economic returns."
AskHistorians,"The ancient greeks idealized the small penis a sign of masculinity, as opposed to a big dick, which they ascribed to barbarians as uncivilized and lustful. When did this change and the big dick became a symbol of masculinity?","Hi Grey,

I think it's helpful to make a distinction between smaller dicks being desirable, and them being masculine, as these are two slightly different things.

For the Greeks, having a big penis wasn't necessarily any less masculine than a small one, and that distinction between a 'masculine' and 'feminine' ideal wasn't as central to their conception of attractiveness as it is for us today. Remember, this was a society whose conception of sexuality and attraction is far less defined by gender than our own, so 'presenting more masculine' wasn't a singular, fixed set of traits in the way it would later become.

Rather, penis-size was used to symbolise different aspects or presentations of masculinity, some of which that the Greeks saw as desirable, and others less so. A big penis is still masculine, but it represents the animalistic, instinctual parts of the 'male nature' they disapproved of. God's like [Priapos ](https://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Priapos.html), or [Dionysus ](https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Dionysos.html) are both very masculine and very well endowed, but as deities of reproduction/male fertility and partying/alcohol respectively, they represent the barbaric 'base' parts of masculinity.

Similarly, a smaller penis came to represent the triumph of the 'higher order' of civilised masculine traits like reason, logic, and philosophy and a man's mastery of his coarser instincts. These higher traits still epitomised a form of masculinity, (indeed they still do to this day), but just on the other side of the coin to those a larger penis represented. Today, those two sides of masculinity are traditionally seen as part-and parcel of the same ideal, but for the Greeks they were decidedly separate.

Importantly, this did not mean they found larger penises universally unattractive. Excavations of Greek or Roman brothels and pornographic art frequently feature depictions or dedications to the barbaric big-dick deities like Priapos, and the images of even the regular men involved often show them very well endowed as well. A large penis and an animalistic masculinity were still attractive, it was just reserved for more taboo and carnal situations. While to our modern sensibilities, nudity is usually seen as sexual in some way, for the greeks things were not as clear-cut. The 'heroic' nude sculpture of public figures, mythical heroes, and deities we associate with the Greeks weren't necessarily intended to be sexualised in the same way those depictions in brothels were. They're meant to be attractive, certainly, but more in the sense of aesthetically than lustfully, because the later is barbaric and un-greek. They're not being given smaller dicks because they're inherently more masculine, they're being given smaller dicks because they're inherently more *civilised*. (Sorry, feel I haven't expalined that distinction well, feel free to ask me to clarify).

To some extent, this association of our genitalia with instinctive virility continues to this day. 'thinking with your dick, not your head' is a common sentiment/description for blindly following your horny urges rather than considering them rationally, and overly-small or tight swimming trunks are often regarded as inappropriate for men to wear etc. The difference is that in our more binary 'masculine/feminine-centric' conception of beauty, we don't see the aspects of masculinity in that association as being a negative or taboo in the way the Greeks did. Being more masculine is traditionally attractive, whatever form it takes, so having a big dick and the traits it's associated with are generally seen as a good thing for men to have. Being 'rational' and being sexually aggressive are part of the same (positive) male stereotype for us, whereas for the Greeks they were part of two separate, conflicting, ones.

TL;DR, the underlying associations didn't really change, the fact different aspects of masculinity were in tension with our social ideals of manhood did.

As for when that shift occurred, it's hard to put a precise date on it for a few reasons:

The Roman empire's gradual decline and cultural fragmentation means there isn't a clear demarcation between the death of greco-roman dominant culture, and the variety that replaced it. Did the Germanic tribes increasingly integrated into Rome's borders share these cultural/aesthetic sensibilities, or did they just mimic Roman customs insincerely to gain access to her empire? Should we see them as replacing Greco-Roman norms with new ones, or just as existing cultures filling the vacuum caused by the decline of Rome as a political entity? The answers to these are more a matter of perspective than anything else, and can lead you to results ranging from 'It was never idealised in this way outside of Greece and Rome in the first place' to 'only with the final fall of Byzantium in 1453'.

Complicating our picture future is the trend of European nobility and artists to hark back to and mimic the aesthetic traditions and norms of Greece and especially Rome to symbolise their own civility and learnedness. Thus, even in an era where padded codpieces and sculpted genital armour is the norm, paintings and sculptures depicting nude figures with smaller penises are still not uncommon because that's how classical art portrayed them, and everyone's trying to copy/learn from classical art. Should we see this as a genuine expression of aesthetic preference, or just a copying of Greco-roman norms? 

There isn't a definitive right and wrong answer to these questions, it more depends on your take on some of the biggest and most intractable questions of post-classical history.

Sorry that's not a particularly satisfying answer, but hopefully it's an interesting one :)

Have a lovely day"
AskHistorians,How did Anchorage become so much larger than any other settlements in northern North America?,"There are two major factors here: location and the US Air Force.

Just to emphasize your original point, more than half of Alaskans live in the Anchorage area today, but the city is surprisingly young.  It was first settled in 1914, and in the 1940 census had a population of only 3,495 people.

The early history of Anchorage is linked to the Alaska Railroad, which runs from Fairbanks (deep in the Alaskan interior) to the coast at Seward nearly 500 miles south on the Kenai peninsula. Fairbanks was the center for mining in Alaska, while Seward offered a year-round ice free port.  What is now Anchorage was established to support construction of the railroad, given its location along the route and access to a good harbor.  The railroad was eventually completed in 1923 and Anchorage became an important railroad town, but a minor settlement in the grand scheme of things.  As of 1940, it was about the same size as Fairbanks and considerably smaller than Juneau or Ketchikan.

The turning point for Anchorage was WWII.  Alaska sits in a strategically important location on the routes linking Asia and North America by either sea or air (this is more obvious on a globe or a polar projection map than a traditional map projection).  As of the mid-1930s, there was essentially no US military presence in Alaska but growing conflict with Japan led to an increased concern with Alaska's strategic value, including both the resource rich Alaskan interior and the Aleutian Islands.

In the late 1930s, the US began building up military forces in Alaska, starting with Fort Wainwright near Fairbanks.  This was soon supplemented with an Army base (Fort Richardson) and airfield (Elmendorf Field) located near Anchorage.  Placing this air base at Anchorage offered a number of advantages, including the harbor and the way the surrounding mountains offer a kind of natural protection.  With the building of the base, resources and people began flowing into Anchorage.  

Pearl Harbor hugely amplified that.  By 1945, there were approximately 70,000 people in Anchorage, although most of those were temporary military residents.  The newly constructed Elmendorf Field became the key hub of the Aleutians campaign and operations against the Kurile Islands.  By the end of the war, Anchorage was by far the largest city in Alaska.  Even after the end of wartime deployments, Anchorage was left with a population of just over 11,000 in the 1950 census, nearly double the size of Juneau (then Alaska's second largest city).

Anchorage remained strategically important in the Cold War -- Alaska is by far the closest part of the United States to the USSR.  The Alaska Air Command, based at Elmendorf, was a key link in North American air defense and Elmendorf remained the key driver of Anchorage's economy in the 50s and 60s.  By the 1960 census, Anchorage had 44,000 residents (more than triple the size of second place Fairbanks).  Anchorage's civilian airport also became an important hub for cargo and passenger flights to Asia for the same geographic reasons.  

In 1964, Alaska was hit by one of the largest earthquakes in history.  This devastated Anchorage, but also gave the city an indirect boost because the port of Anchorage was the only one in the region to survive the earthquake, cementing Anchorage's status as the dominant port and transportation hub of Alaska.  

Subsequent growth in Alaska was largely driven by the oil boom that began with the 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay.  Anchorage was not directly connected to the oil fields (and the pipeline for shipping oil runs to Valdez rather than Anchorage) but by that point Anchorage was Alaska's dominant city and dominant transportation hub.  The oil rich north slope is inhospitable, and so the administrative and support operations for the oilfields ended up in Anchorage given its size and prominence.  At some point, growth like that becomes self-reinforcing and it would now be very hard for any other city to lure those businesses away from Anchorage."
AskHistorians,Were the beds of royals shorter because they were sitting up more to sleep?,"This is an annoyingly difficult question to answer. At this point the whole ""[people][peasants][kings][rich people] in [middle-ages][renaissance][up to the French revolution] used to sleep [upright][half-sitting] because [supersition about death][combat readiness][fear of demons][better digestion]"" has become a popular trope told by guides to visitors of ancient buildings all over Europe and North America ... and widely disseminated by vendors of beds and mattresses. And the ""beds are shorter"" thing is part of this.

To be clear, information about the positions used by people to sleep in the past in Western Europe is limited, like many of those daily habits that people take for granted and do not bother to write about. Scholarly literature, with the exception of Hanley (2019) does not say much about this or, or authors take for granted (without sourcing the claim) that people did indeed sleep upright (Perrot, 2013; Garnier, 2019). Verdon (1994) says that medieval iconography shows sleepers in uncomfortable positions, seated or even standing up, or, when lying down, with their bodies contorted, but I do not have access to his sources.

First we can review the pictorial information and I'll address some of the available writings in the end.

The first person (possibly) to pick up this idea was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, one of the most influential architect and scholar of architecture and design of the 19th century. His *Dictionnaire raisonné du mobilier français de l'époque carolingienne à la Renaissance* (1858) has a *Lit* (Bed) entry where he discusses the evolution of bed from the early middle-ages to the Renaissance. According to Viollet-le-Duc:

>Manuscripts from the Carolingian period provide a large number of examples of this type of furniture, whose shape and layout indicate the use of bronze. These beds were much higher at the bedside than at the feet, so that the person lying on them was almost on a sitting position. This type of bed persisted until the 13th century. A pile of cushions, more numerous and thicker towards the head, were used to give the bed a steep slope. 

The book presents modern interpretations ([here](https://books.google.fr/books?id=VW7M74bUu8oC&pg=PA175#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [here](https://books.google.fr/books?id=VW7M74bUu8oC&pg=PA178#v=onepage&q&f=false) for instance) of the medieval images, with Viollet-le-Duc acknowledging that he corrected the perspective of the original pictures. 

There is indeed a wealth of images in medieval manuscripts showing people in bed for all sorts of activities. Important caveat: as Mane (1999) writes, interpreting iconography should be done carefully.

**12-14th century**

Medieval iconography anterior to the 1400s does indeed show people (upper class and mythical) lying in bed in a sitting or half-sitting position. Here are some examples.

* Portal of St. Martin's Cathedral in Lucca, Italy, circa 1250, [Relief of the life of Saint-Martin of Tours](https://imgur.com/a/9APPPdC). Saint Martin of Tours seems to be already dead here, but other images show him rebuking the devil on his deathbed: [Altar from the Church of Saint Martin in Chia, 1150-1200](https://www.mediastorehouse.com.au/fine-art-finder/artists/ribagorca-workshop-johannes-pintor/death-st-martin-tours-altar-frontal-church-12761440.html), and the 15th century version [Death of Saint-Martin, Derik Baegert 1490](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Derick_Baegert_-_Death_of_St_Martin_of_Tours.jpg).

As we can see in these images, in 12-13th centuries, representations of royal or famous people lying in bed for whatever reason - sleeping, sex, sickness, death - is quite normalized: they all lie on a mattress curved at top, with their head on a square pillow.  

**15-13th century**

This changes in the following century. Here are people lying in bed illustrated by Evrart d'Espinques. This artist mostly shows the same bed, empty or with people inside doing all sort of things.

* *Sept sages de Rome*, Evrart d'Espinques, 1466, [A queen and her newborn baby](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b525128401/f39.item)

* Ibid. [Lancelot preparing to join a naked woman in bed, with another woman watching](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55001676w/f245.item.zoom)

All these images show basically the same bed, rectangular and flat. There's usually a cylindrical bolster and one or two pillows to support the head.

In the frontispiece of *Les fais maistre Alain Chartier* (1489), Charles VI's secretary is shown lying, but not sleeping, with his head [on a big pile of pillows](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70118r). German artist Hans Weiditz, in this woodcut about the *Celestina*, shows [Melibea sitting upright](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1913-0910-8): the fact that she is topless may indicate that she was sleeping upright before Celestina came to see her. Another picture of the series shows an [empty bed with two large pillows](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1913-0910-7).

**16th century and later**

[*Venus asleep and Vulcan at his forge*](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10491777k) (Enea Vico, 1543) shows Venus' upper body resting on a very large pillow. This [Venus](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10488488d) from 1760 is sleeping on the ground, with her upper half resting on drapes (Jean Daullé after Nicolas Poussin). Another bed shown in an erotic (but violent) setting is in Titian's [*Tarquin and Lucretia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarquin_and_Lucretia) (1671), where Lucretia was reclining on three thick cushions before being raped by Tarquin.

Another examples of people sleeping with their heads on large pillows are the frontispieces of two British ""curtain lectures"", [*A curtained lecture*](https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/s/owe05a) (Thomas Heywood, 1637) and [*Ar't asleep husband*](https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/s/0j7870) (Richard Braithwaite, 1640), a comedic literary genre that had wives lecturing their husbands at bedtime.

Other images show people lying in a much flatter position:

* [*Jezebel Promising Naboth's Vineyards to King Ahab*](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/364694), Lucas van Leyden, 1517

* [*Saints Cosmas and Damian Performing a Miraculous Cure by Transplantation of a Leg*](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_03251/), 1495.

The [illustration](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8609510f/f37.double) of Gilles Corrozet's poem about his bed (*Delicate bad, soft and plush...*) in *Les blasons domestiques*, 1539, is difficult to decipher, as what should be the head of the bed is much lower than the foot! Otherwise this would be an example of a mattress curved upright like in the 12-13th century.

Sick people are often shown reclining or partly upright. This is notably the case in Swiss artist Conrad Meyer's engraving [*Caring for the Ill*](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.132316.html) (17th century) where hospital patients all rest on reclining beds. King Henri II on his deathbed (Jacques Tororel and Jean Perrissin, 1569-1570)) is on a [flat bed with pillows behind his head](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5653061f/f77.item.zoom), but Henri III on his deathbed [is sitting upright](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8400864r) to crown Henri IV (Frans Hogenberg, 1588-1589). Another example is the [deathbed scene](https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/s/7d38s8) in *Of prayer and meditation* (Luis de Granada, 1612).

AskHistorians,"Early Irish law texts like the Críth Gablach and Uraicecht Becc say things like ‘[peasants] are not entitled to butter’ but what does that mean? They couldn’t make or possess butter, or that they couldn’t be given butter at a public feast or as alms?","I'm far from an expert, but I went down a rabbit hole around dietary customs in Ireland recently, and read a short paper that dealt exactly with this. It's ""‘He is not entitled to butter’: the diet of peasants and commoners in early medieval Ireland"" by Cherie N. Peters, and I [read it on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3318/priac.2015.115.03), it's a light read and quite a romp if this interests you at all.

The idea, as far as I understand it, is that all tiers of society were entitled to rights of hospitality in customary law when they visited your house. So a lot of these law texts were basically saying, 'you have to provide a member of society at X tier with mutton if he comes to visit you'. That was to reinforce the stratification of society, which was ridiculously granular in that era in Ireland.

Again, that's because hospitality was required to be granted to everyone, no matter their rank in society. So it was important also to reinforce that while you had to grant some hospitality to a 'peasant' – and the reason 'peasant' is in brackets in your quote is that it's actually *fer midboth*, which is a bottom-tier peasant – you didn't have to give them butter. Higher-ranked 'peasants' like *aithech ara threba a deich*, could ask for butter.

But no, peasants were 'entitled' to butter in their own homes, if they had it. In some periods/in some law texts there *were* restrictions on plenty of foods that didn't allow certain levels of peasant to eat them at all (I think both honey and sweet apples were sometimes like this, and maybe some cuts of cattle) that went beyond that, but the butter 'entitlement' is just about hospitality, not a rule for what they can consume on their own time."

AskHistorians,"A contemporary ""protein shake"" is just whey, a byproduct of cheesemaking, dissolved in water or milk. How old is the practice of drinking this for strength or fitness purposes? If I trained for the ancient Olympics would I be scooping protein powder into a ceramic shaker bottle?","A question I can definitely ~~weigh~~ whey in on. 

We need not go back to Greek antiquity, but as recently as the turn of the 20th century, bodybuilding was a novelty. As the popularity of vaudeville died out, circus tents and touring became more prominent as an entertainment venue. 'Strongmen' were seen as impressive, though still curious. More importantly, the enduring image of the turn-of-the-century Strongman was not known for being particularly lean or proportional. Raw mass that supplemented the strength potential was en vogue, for lack of a better term.

I would argue that two men who were known Strongmen broke the mold and gave birth to the growing popularity of bodybuilding - Eugen Sandow and George Hackenschmidt. The former's famous pose still adorns the Mr Olympia logo and medal to this day, while the latter is the father of the Hack squat. These two began to modulate their micronutrient intakes and training protocols to imitate the statues, paintings, and iconography of Hellenistic art. They were pioneers in marrying what most agree were exaggerated works with actual physical embodiment. And they did it with steak, eggs, bread, milk, etc. exclusively. 

Now then, fast forward to the 50s and 60s. Post-war studies on building stronger, faster, and more durable soldiers are being conducted en masse. The scientific community of America is becoming less and less rhetoric-driven and beginning to experiment passionately again. And the proliferation of professional sports as a true enterprise are encouraging tremendous research into new means and methods to create what will eventually become superhumans in the vein of Julius Peppers and LeBron James. 

Sandow and Hackenschmidts methods have been quietly expanded on by the likes of Bill Star and Sheiko. And a post-war America is interested more and more with niche spectacles and sports like bodybuilding. Local events grow and encourage states. Which inform regionals. Which spawn nationals. 

**Rheo Blair** is arguably the father of the protein supplement as you know it. His milk and egg powder becomes the first widespread, purpose-driven bodybuilding and muscular hypertrophy supplement. His 'Optipro' supplement became the de facto cornerstone of a virtual who's who of Golden Era bodybuilders. Arnold, Columbu, Oliva, Scott, etc. Blair not only had the market ""cornered"" on his protein supplement, but was training national champions to boot. Without him, the ubiquitous nature of supplements and fitness culture we know today simply wouldn't exist. Liver pills and the other niche ""supplements"" of the time simply did not, and presumably never would have (Liver King being a byproduct of evolution) been as accessible and digestible to the overall consuming public.

However, **Mr Blair walked so that Joe Weider could run like the wind.** Weider earned his place as the Godfather of Bodybuilding, arguably even more influential than Jack LaLanne. Discussing him deserves its own post at a minimum, although the books and longforms the world over should set you on the right path.

In short, no. You would not be drinking shakes in the height of Greek antiquity. I would argue that post-industrial circus acts and post-WWII physiology advancements/recreational opportunities are to thank for your Dymatize Iso powder.

AskHistorians,"Between 1596 to 1601, Queen Elizabeth I wrote a series of letters complaining of the “great numbers of Negars and Blackamoors” in England and authorizing their deportation. What was the exact ethnic and/or racial identity of this group? Why were they targeted in this way and not other groups?","Alright a LOT to unpack in this one. I will try and cover the questions as best I can. 

1- the ‘exact’ ethnic/racial identity question is always hard as this is the late 16th Century and no one thought about exact racial identity of folks in a way that is recognisable to us today. 

The letters were based upon a series of events caused by the on ongoing geopolitic struggles England was facing. Basically, England was in a state of undeclared war with the Spanish Hapsburg Empire, which was seeing it conduct a clandestine warfare upon the sea lanes using irregular forces to interdict Spanish commercial operations. 

Which is a nice way to say ‘pirates’. Lots of pirates. 

Pirates romping all over the place. And being pirates they would capture, if they could, Spanish ships. And if they captured said ships they would try and take the ships and their cargos back to London (since most of the financial backers for these expeditions were from London).  Which meant the cargos were dumped in London. 

And sometimes these cargos were slaves. 

The standard policy then was to just release them there and then.  The pirates didn’t care. They were just dumped. And this is what caused the original complaints. 

There were increased numbers of the inhabitants of Africa and possibly the Indian Ocean now finding themselves in London. The civic authorities had to look after them. They asked for money from the crown.  This is the crown under Elizabeth. The word ‘parsimonious’ shall be used to describe her relationship with cash as this is a family show. 

Basically it all ended up on Lord Cecil’s desk. He wanted none of this and so eventually someone suggested to the Queen a radical and simple solution. 

Let’s hire a Dutch captain, give him a license, and empower him to go around London and round up these former slaves and dump them... where?

They didn’t care. 

So in answer to your first question?

While much is made to suggest *Negars and Blackamoors* represent clear ethnic lines (and several have argued we should see one title referring to West Africans and another to North Africans), I am afraid we really do not know. At all. They were generalised nicknames used somewhat interchangeably. 


But we can say that they were talking about a group of folks who were African in origin and based on the nature of the Spanish/Portuguese slave trade, mostly West African. 


However- see all of the above? It IS a simplification of the story.  


2- why were the targeted in this way?

You mean why did they get off so lightly?

This is 15th Century London here. In fact this is ANY Century London here. The natives of London seemed to have a genetic predisposition towards xenophobia running back to the 9th Century. 

This was a city with a long history of hating ‘them’ (aka anyone not native London born) and happily raising mobs to violate any foreign born neighbour/community. After several Jewish pogroms over the centuries, London had focused its attention/hatred on sporadic riots/attacks against any foreigners (including the infamous ‘Evil May Day Riots’) and during Elizabeth’s reign the influx of French Protestant refugees into the city had been met with hostility and bigotry (plus Guilds making sure that any French wine seller would be barred from practicing their trade IN London, which is why Southwark became known for being the only place around you could get decent French alcohol).

Literally, the attempt to round up and deport Africans was about as mild a response you could hope for. This is not claiming the Elizabethans were not bigots- they WERE bigots. But back in the day they had a LOT of other things to be bigoted over and modern bigot priorities didn’t exist back then. 

Please note Elizabeth’s commission saw the Dutch captain in question utterly fail at his task. 

He tried again. And failed again.


We have reason to suspect that several of this community had began to have ties with the local community and were offered a degree of protection. 


Also worth noting that it was around this time however that one of the greatest con jobs ever organised by London’s criminal networks took place and this may have involved a North African and this may have helped increase attention upon the community. 


What con job? A ship turned up at the London docks wherein a gentleman presented himself and his entourage as a representative of the Ottoman Empire. The Levant Company greeted him and said entourage with great respect and hoping to secure some plumb trade contacts, hosted him for a few weeks. Despite a clear warning from Lord Cecil that he had never heard of this guy the Levant Company spent a fortune indulging him and his entourages every whim. 

And then they guy (and his entourage) disappeared, supposedly with a load of the Elizabethan equivalent of ‘the silverware’ and a few months passed before state papers reveal the Levant Company asking Cecil for financial compensation for being fleeced like this. 


Cecil’s reply I would imagine was preceded by a hearty laugh. 


I mention this as it was contemporaneous to the discussions about growing populations and also I do not think the team who pulled off this Levant Company Job could have done it without having some who at least looked authentic. **EDIT: Forgive me all, I include the above still but must correct; the event mention here took place a few years LATER, after Elizabeth’s letter; must mention the correction however as accuracy is crucial** 


Additional questions:
1- covered in the above. 


2- we do not have accurate numbers. Not do we have any breakdowns at all. We know there were enough to be mentioned. Which given the time and given the location (we are talking London here but could have included any port where Spanish goods were being dumped so you could possibly include Bristol or Plymouth) I think we are looking at a number between around 100 to around 400. Could be more but I figure 100-200 tops. I am erring on the side of caution here but the natural conservative historian in me says we are talking ‘dozens’ not ‘hundreds’.


Enough to be noticed. Not enough to cause a violent reaction from Apprentice Boy mobs. 


3- ideologically? The Ottomans were the enemy. For a bit. And then they became the desired allies. 

Understand from Elizabeth’s point of view? THE enemy was Spain. And since Spain was at war with the Ottoman Turks? The enemy of my enemy was my friend...

Mostly the age was one of overwhelming ignorance of Islam and the affairs of Islam and Islamic beliefs. You had the Levant Company desperate to increase profits with the Ottoman Empire but on the whole the Tudor courts geopolitical horizons didn’t see much beyond what was needed to stay alive. They felt under siege and under attack almost constantly (imagined attacks or otherwise).

AskHistorians,Were muslim armies harder to maintain in the field?,"The quote is, as you say, “Muslim armies were notoriously difficult to maintain in the field for long periods of time, particularly during sieges” (pg. 80). When I saw the question I thought “oh yeah, that’s true.” It’s sort of received wisdom in the history of the crusades, so Asbridge apparently didn’t think it was necessary to cite it. It took a few days to answer this question because I also had trouble tracking down why exactly that was the case.

There are actually a couple of different reasons. In this case, Ilghazi was a Seljuk Turk and his army was mostly fellow Turkic nomads from central Asia. The Seljuks had been in the Middle East for about 60 years by this point, so they were no longer entirely nomadic. The base of Ilghazi’s power was in the city of Aleppo. But many Turks, and perhaps most of the troops in his army, were still nomadic. After the “Field of Blood”, the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, his troops were really only concerned with getting paid, either in coin or in plunder. Ilghazi was criticized for not following up on the victory by attacking Antioch, now that he had destroyed the army of the crusader principality.  

>“Ilghazi may have won a battle, but his Turkmen forces were natural raiders and were not necessarily suited or inclined to maintain a lengthy siege against a major city.” (Morton 91)

Antioch had been extremely difficult to besiege during the First Crusade. The crusaders captured it in 1097 but only by trickery - an Armenian inhabitant let them in. Then they were besieged themselves by a combination of Seljuk forces from Mosul, Aleppo, and Damascus, and they weren’t really suited or inclined to besiege a large city either. They were never able to coordinate their efforts and eventually the crusaders marched out of Antioch and defeated them in 1098. Now in 1119 the crusaders were fully entrenched in Antioch and there was probably no way Ilghazi could maintain his army for a siege that might take a year or more and which would probably be unsuccessful.

The other reason is that there was no such thing as a professional standing army, either among the Muslims or the Franks. Armies of nomadic Turks were one thing, but if an army needed to be raised from the settled Arab population, it would be raised in whatever territory it was needed, and would be made up of people who were otherwise occupied growing and harvesting crops. The commanders/leaders of such an army would be the people who owned the land being harvested, and/or who had rights to collect taxes from it. Later in the 12th century,

>“During the spring harvest season, which covers March, April and May in upper and lower Egypt, many of Saladin’s men would be supervising the work on their iqtas” (Lyons and Cameron, 67)

An iqta was kind of like a fief in western Europe and that’s how the crusaders understood it, i.e. it was mostly rural land, which the residents farmed and harvested for the person who owned it, the muqta. The muqta was not exactly like a European lord since they didn’t necessarily own the land by hereditary right and might not have lived there (although those weren’t requirements for European lords either). The muqta held the land because he was granted rights to it by the emir or sultan, and although the muqta’s heirs could inherit the iqta, they would have to be officially granted rights to it as well, it wouldn’t just automatically pass to them (like a fief likely would in Europe). The muqta has the right to collect taxes from the land, either in money or in part of the harvest.

In areas that the crusaders conquered they mostly left this system intact, since it was already close enough to the agricultural system they knew back home. That meant it was also difficult for them to keep an army in the field indefinitely, if the army was made up of Franks who lived in the east. They would also want to go back to their fiefs and collect their harvest and their taxes. This is why the Franks in the east were always desperate for help from Europe, since a new crusade would be the closest thing they had to a standing army - people who had no territory in the east and nothing else to do there except fight. But even they would eventually want to go home. The vast majority of the First Crusade simply went home after they conquered Jerusalem. The Second Crusade also largely disbanded and returned home when they failed to conquer Damascus in 1148. In 1192, both sides of the Third Crusade agreed to a truce partly because they were exhausted and wanted to leave - Saladin’s forces wanted to go home for the harvest, and many of the crusader forces also wanted to go home and take care of their own fiefs.

The Franks in the east were also desperate for money, which they could use to hire mercenaries. An army of mercenaries wasn’t equivalent to a standing army, since they would also eventually want to go to home, especially if they weren’t being reliably paid or the money ran out. Muslim armies could also be raised this way but with the same concerns (as mentioned, this was one of Ilghazi’s problems in 1119). For the Franks, mercenaries were sometimes called “Turcopoles”, which would seem to mean they were recruited from among the Turks…but we’re actually not really sure who they were or where they came from, or if the word was simply used for some kind of military unit, whether it was Turkic or not, or whether or not they were actually mercenaries. 

The Franks also had another military asset, the military orders of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, as well as the Teutonic Knights later in the 12th century, and various other smaller orders. But they weren’t technically subject to any Frankish lords - they were religious orders of monks who also happened to be soldiers, so they were only subject to their own Grand Masters and ultimately the pope. They had their own agendas and sometimes they simply didn’t want to help Antioch or Jerusalem, or made their own separate truces with Muslim leaders. There was no equivalent of the military orders among the Muslims.

So, for the Muslims, sometimes an army consisted of nomadic Turks who weren’t interested in campaigning long-term, since that’s just not how they operated. Otherwise, for both the Muslims and the Franks, armies had to be raised from local agricultural workers, who would want to go home to collect the harvest, and from the owners of this agricultural land, who would want to go home and make sure they collected their taxes. It wasn't really a peculiar characteristic of Muslim armies, since the campaigning season was built around the agricultural year for both sides. As a result, raising a large army was difficult and only happened a few times - for example when Saladin defeated the crusaders at the Battle of Hattin in 1187 and then went on to recapture Jerusalem and most of the other Frankish cities. Even that army eventually dispersed for the harvest season. What happened more often was that much smaller armies would be raised and there would be more or less constant raids into Frankish or Muslim territory. 

There are plenty of sources about warfare during the crusades, and I’m sure this answer barely even scratches the surface. But here are some of the sources I used:

AskHistorians,"Brazil is the Blackest country outside of Africa, with roughly half of its population identifying as Afro-Brazilian. What is the history of segregation in Brazil (especially after emancipation), and was there a ""successful"" racist institutional backlash to integration like Jim Crow in the U.S.?","I don't really have the time for an in-depth answer but the short answer to your main question is ""No, Brazil never had direct segregation laws like Jim Crow."" In fact, racial relations in Brazil were so different from those of the US that Ford Foundation sponsored Brazilian researchers to investigate racial relations here, which resulted in one of Brazil's foundational sociology books: *A integração do negro na sociedade de classes* [The Negro in Brazilian Society] by Florestan Fernandes, published in 1965.

The first Brazilian historians who were tasked with writing the history of Brazil in the mid to late 19th century were all, more or less, based on the idea that the country was founded on miscigenation the miscigenation of Europeans, Indigenous populations and enslaved Black peoples (names such as Karl Philip Von Martius, Francisco Adolpho Varnhagen and João Capistrano de Abreu). So, these first names more or less established the idea that, while an obviously racially segregated country, Brazil had some racial harmony.

By the 1930s, Gilberto Freyre (who also received a grant from Ford Foundation later on, by the way), published *Casa-grande e Senzala* [The masters and the slaves]. This book is the great basis for, what Florestan would call, ""Brazil's myth of racial democracy."" Which means that the very misgenation I mentioned above would mean that racism in Brazil did not exist and we were a country where racial equality reigned. Now, here's the thing, Freyre had a background in the anthropology developed in the US at the time (he met Franz Boas in Columbia, for example), so his observations about Brazil's racially reality were precisely affected by said background. As a note, the book (and the rest of his production) presents actual and very interesting research about racial relations in Brazil, he just has to be read as someone whose main thesis has long been surpassed.

While Florestan ""debunked"" Freyre's thesis in the 1960s, his ideas have a deep impact in Brazilian society to this day—for example, former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was advised by Freyre, and while the 1990s were troubled times here for several reasons, the racial debate barely advanced at institutional level (racial quotas for higher education, actual discussions about race inequality, and we even have laws that criminalize racism nowadays.

Beyond the authors and books I mentioned (Freyre's and Fernandes' are available in English), I can recommend [this article by Fernandes as a starting point.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24604427) The history of race relations in Brazil is much deeper and more complicated, I merely presented some aspects of the academic debate (which ended up serving as a basis for public policies for several decades).

Edit: as a note for something I forgot and relates to State policies, post-Abolition, the Brazilian government invested heavily in immigration policies, and the country received thousands of Italian, Spanish and, later Japanese, immigrants. This was a part of what came to be known as ""Whitening policy"", which was meant to replace Black peoples as both labor and citizens. *Black Into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought* by Thomas Skidmore is a decent English-language reference on it."

AskHistorians,"How much is modern European ""paganism"" actually based on pre-Christian religion?","It is difficult to speak of one origin for the Neo-Pagan movements that have cropped up in the past several centuries as there are a number of different thinkers, cultural contexts, and developments that have resulted in the creation of modern Neo-Pagan groups.  However there are some broad conclusions that we can arrive at.  In general we can group modern Neo-pagan groups into two varieties, and these are broad classifications not hard and fast rules or strict categories, and there is significant bleed over between these two groups.  The two groups are reconstructionist groups and groups that knowingly blend traditions from a variety of different sources together into a more universal form of the religion.  This second group is sometimes called ""eclectic"" or ""universal"" paganism to differentiate it from reconstructionist pagan groups.

So I will treat these two separately, but it is worth bearing in mind that these distinctions are at some level an imposition from the outside, that may or may not reflect how practitioners view their own beliefs.

**Blended Traditions**

This is the more famous version of modern Paganism and the one that many people are more familiar with.  The blended, eclectic, universal, whichever name you prefer, variations of paganism are not inextricably tied to a particular time or place and they take inspiration, beliefs, and ideas from a variety of religious traditions.  To continue using religious identification terminology, this branch of paganism tends to be a more universalist approach to the religion, that applies its beliefs to the entire world.  While statistics are tricky, and modern census/surveys sometimes stumble with the language used, this form of paganism is the more popular one, especially in the Anglophone world.  

This branch of modern Paganism encompasses religious traditions such as Wicca, which has its origins in the late 19th century and particularly in ideas about the religious beliefs of the Medieval world.  Many people were influential on the development of Wicca as a religious tradition, but one of the most influential was Margaret Murray, an English Egyptology and ostensible Medievalist.  As I understand it, her career as an Egyptologist is rather remarkable and her scholarly contributions genuine.  However, in her career as a Medievalist, her ideas have received significantly more push back and resistance.  Her most famous idea was that Medieval and Early Modern Europe was the site of a showdown between the Catholic Church and a brutally repressed and ancient tradition that was condemned as witchcraft, but was in reality a Pagan religious tradition with ties to the pre-Christian world.  Suffice it to say that Murray's ideas were not accepted by the academic community but were *enormously* influential on the development of Neo-Pagan religious ideas.  

Now Murray was not the only influence on early Wicca, Gerald Gardner deserves a great deal more attention than I will give, and there were a variety of influences coming from many different angles, there was academic influence from figures like Murray, but the late 19th century was also fertile ground for many other occult movements that emphasized spiritualism, naturalism, and many other ideas that we might toss into the catch all term of ""occultism"" that drew on long standing cultural movements, stretching back to the 18th century in some cases.  Indeed Ronald Hutton characterizes the growth of these pagan movements as the ""belted offspring of the Romantic movement"" and ""the enduring love affair of Christian civilization with the art and literature of the pagan world"".

According to Hutton, the various strands of thought that influenced 19th/20th century Britain in particular, romanticism, urbanism, individualism, secularism, pluralism, postmodernism, feminism, among other -isms were the major contributing factor to the development and emergence of these sorts of pagan religious practices.  The developments that went through this period, Hutton compares to the Reformation in a (to my tastes slightly tortured) metaphor sense, that the modern Neo-pagan practices such as Wicca are an attempt to reform the various traditions of the pre-Christian societies of the world into a coherent(ish) and acceptably modern form. 



**Reconstructionists**

Reconstructionism is a different beast than eclecticism or universal Paganism.  Adherents to reconstructionist schools of Paganism are significantly more narrowly focused than universal Pagans.  Their religious beliefs, in general, are tied to pre-Christian traditions and seek to recreate those ideas, beliefs, and practices, as best as can be done given the paucity of sources. As a result, these traditions and practices tend to be classified more as an ""ethnic"" religion, another descriptor used in religious traditions, and it is again worth repeating that these categories are not set in stone and different traditions and practices may blur the lines between these distinctions.  

Now it is worth bearing in mind that our understanding of pre-Christian religious beliefs, rites, and so on is often exceedingly fragmentary, and it is often not possible for scholars to definitively say *how* or *why* a ritual was conducted in the past, but reconstructionist groups often try to do this through studying the available sources, whether it is literary, archaeological, or speculative.  Furthermore many historical practices cannot be practiced just as they were in the past due to modern cultural taboos or laws.  For example, the existence of human sacrifice is quite obviously present in practices of the Norse people, but a modern Norse pagan practicing the ritualized sacrifice of human beings would be murder.  Therefore modern interpretations and replacements for historical practices are also common.  

These groups often tend to be very tied to particular places and times and connect back to the pre-Christian practices in those locations.  For example, modern practitioners of Druidry, Heathenry (also called Asatru), and Hellenism and the like tend to come from areas where those practices were historically present or from immigrant communities descended from them.  For example in the United States, adherents of Asatru or Heathenry are disproportionately drawn from the descendants of people from Northern Europe.  This is, again, not a hard and fast rule, but a general trend.  It has its roots in a different kind of cultural context than the late 19th/early 20th century occultism and romanticism that movements like Wicca derived from however.  

Due to this more, ironically, eclectic pattern of membership and origin, it is difficult to speak of individual influences on the rise of reconstructionist groups, rather these movements tend to arise in areas with distinct historical and ethnic patterns.  

This is where, sadly, the Nazis enter the conversation.  Reconstructionist religious groups have frequently been a part of truly vile political/religious convergence.  The connection between Nazism and Germanic paganism and the occult more broadly is hardly news to most people, but this legacy continues today as many white supremacist organizations appropriate and use the visual language, ie the symbols, of pagan traditions.  Now, to be clear, the majority of reconstructionist pagans are NOT Nazis or white supremacists.  It is however, an undeniable element of the movement today.  The same accusations can be levied at Medievalists and Classicists as well.  Nor is the relationship between Nazism and Paganism clearly delineated from other issues, as the relationship between Christianity and the Nazis is likewise extremely complicated.  Nazi figures like Alfred Rosenberg and Heinrich Himmler both developed schools of occult thought that emphasized racial purity and antisemitism as core parts of their occult practices, though the adoption of these beliefs among the Nazi high command was minimal and today is limited to white supremacist groups, predominantly in Germany and Scandinavia.

Instead of singular causes, or even the hodgepodge offspring of various historical -isms, the ethnic and place dependent nature of many reconstructionist movements places their origins with an entirely different school of thought, in particular the nationalism of the 19th century in much of western Europe and the resurgent nationalism of Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Married with other modern movement, such as regionalism (or anti-globalization), environmentalism, feminism (though less common in reconstructionism than with eclecticism) and disillusionment with universal methods of explanation, figures like Michael Strimska point to Christianity and Science in particular, has led, in part, to the rise of these new reconstructionist schools (as well as universalist schools) that reject the interference of Christianity on western culture and instead want to look backwards to a more romanticized and imagined past with practices that the practitioners find more acceptable and preferable to alternatives."
AskHistorians,"The Aztecs believed men had a finite amount of semen and should limit their sex life so they wont be ""worn out"" like modern Christianity tells unmarried women. Does this imply male virginity was prized for marriage like female virginity is in modern purity culture?","As everyone knows, moral precepts doled out by authority figures are assiduously followed without deviation. Hence why no one has coveted their neighbor 's wife, ass, or neighbor's wife's ass since Moses came down off the mountain.

Jesting side, the admonitions young men received about not wasting their precious bodily fluids tires directly into ideas of what constituted a good and proper life. Among the Aztecs, life was to be lived purposefully and moderately. Pleasure could (and should!) be had, but needed to be balanced with responsibility.

Finding a balance between austerity and debauchery is a strong theme of Aztec writings on morality. In the multivolume *General History of the Things of New Spain"" compiled by Friar Sahagún and Nahua scribes, Book 6 deals with ""rhetoric and moral philosophy."" There is a famous passage from that book which illustrates how precarious the Aztecs saw virtue:

> Slippery, slick is the earth. It is the same as the one mentioned. Perhaps at one time one was of good life; later he fell into some wrong, as if he had slipped in the mud.

Navigating through the ethical landscape was like threading along a narrow, craggy ridgeline trail next to a deep ravine while in the middle of a rainstorm. Vices like drinking, gambling, and promiscuity were not so much evil temptations as they were gravity -- a relentless cosmic force that required constant effort to resist. Because the Aztecs did not believe that life was simply to be enjoyed, but that each individual needed to serve a higher purpose in life.

Purcell in (2017) “Eudaimonia and Neltiliztli: Aristotle and the Aztecs on the Good Life,” quotes a poem (ostensibly by Nezahualcoyotl) forthrightly stating out the skeptical Aztec view of a ""happy"" life:

> Is it true that we are happy,
 
> that we live on earth? 

> It is not certain that we live 

> and have come on earth to be happy. 

> We are all sorely lacking. 

> Is there any who does not suffer 

> here, next to the people?

Instead of epicurean delights, Purcell posits the Aztecs instead sought ""rootedness."" Faced with a slippery moral world where life itself was ephemeral and joy fleeting, if not outright detrimental, the Aztecs strove for balance and stability.

In some ways the Aztec conception of morality and the cosmos bears a resemblance to the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, which starts but affirming that life is suffering, then noting this suffering is a result of human desires. Aztec metaphysics likewise has the view of the world a ten pounds of shit in a nine pound bag, but ascribes the situation less to human foibles (though those are a factor) and more to the constant entropy of the universe. The cosmological basis of Aztec ethics is an inexorable slide into decay and rot, but that from this filth can come rebirth…  if people are up for the effort.

The deities that created the world were willing to sacrifice to make it happen. In the version in the *Histoire du Mechique*, Tezcatlipoca uses his own foot as bait to catch Tlaltecuhtli, the earth monster, whose body was then torn asunder to create the land. In the *General History… * a good literally cast themself into a pyre to create the Sun, to be shortly followed by the rest of the deities to give it enough energy to move across the sky. Both the Aztec and Maya have stories about a god either piercing his penis and using the blood as part of the as part of the creation, or actually using semen in the process.

The Aztecs believed combatting the entropy of the world required taking on the cosmic debt of the god's sacrifice, and that neglecting this debt would lead to decay, disorder, and eventually the dissolution of this world. As a result, Aztec moral teachings and even descriptions of people are freighted with heavy expectations. A man is not merely an individual going about his life, but is ideally someone who is ""a doer, a worker; agile, active, solicitous,"" while a man failing at life is ""lazy, negligent, slothful, indolent… .""

Success in the Aztec world required purposeful directed action. Not simply for a person to get ahead in life, but to repay the moral debt owed to the universe and, by proxy, their family, their community, their nation. So a young man spending his days in pursuit of carnal pleasures was not just wasting his time and energy, but actively rejecting his spiritual duty."
AskHistorians,"Why did 1993 Battle of Mogadishu with 18 US casualties elicit rather dramatic domestic political response, just two years after 1991 Desert Storm, which allegedly was expected to inflict thousands of casualties?","This is one of those questions that depends mostly on a narrative recounting of the political and military particulars within a comparative framework rather than the citation of authoritative historiographical debates that resolve or address the question, partly because the details of both incidents provide a fairly obvious explanation of the differences in public reaction.  

That makes me hesitate a bit about answering this, as my own expertise mostly covers only the Battle of Mogadishu, and even there, less the political reactions in the United States and more the meaning of conflicts there in post-Cold War history of the Horn of Africa. The scholarly literature on Desert Storm in specific is largely written by military historians who do not substantially address its political impact in the U.S., though many historical analyses of the 1992 Presidential election and the Bush Administration do cover the surprising extent to which the political success of Desert Storm did not translate to a stronger performance by Bush in the election. 

All of this is to say that answering the question has me skirting at the edge of this subreddit's requirements. But I'll take a stab at it by recounting some of the pertinent historical details. 

Desert Shield and Desert Storm were planned within a firmly multilateral framework that drew on Cold War diplomatic relationships and many of the late Cold War's norms in terms of the approach to interstate relations. But they were also planned by a U.S. military that had been significantly expanded during the Reagan Administration from 1980-88 that was eager to demonstrate several operational principles that had been developed as responses to perceived reasons for the failures of the Vietnam War. (Fontenot, Gregory. *The First Infantry Division and the U.S. Army Transformed Road to Victory in Desert Storm, 1970-1991*. Baltimore, Maryland: Project Muse, 2017, deals with some of these changes) First and foremost among those perceived lessons was to seek the strongest political consensus possible (domestically and internationally) in favor of military action prior to undertaking military action and to be prepared to use overwhelming force in pursuit of strategic objectives while also being sure to make those objectives clear, limited and plausibly obtainable. A less explicit doctrinal shift was also to try and manage press and public reactions more carefully. 

Though the OP is completely correct that many people all around the world expected that the actual fighting would produce significant casualties on both sides, in the end, the casualties were almost entirely on the Iraqi side (which were very substantial). Chapter Two of Larson, Eric V., and Bogdan. Savych. *Misfortunes of War : Press and Public Reactions to Civilian Deaths in Wartime.* 1st ed. Santa Monica: RAND Corporation, The, 2006 covers some of the reasons why the public reaction to the war was relatively positive after its end. The coalition forces were careful to handle the video material made available to the press, in particular minimizing gruesome images of Iraqi dead while confirming [reports of tactics like burying Iraqi soldiers alive in entrenched fortifications.](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/world/us-army-buried-iraqi-soldiers-alive-in-gulf-war.html) 

I think you could also say that the expectations of considerable casualties on the coalition side were adroitly raised by both military and civilian leaders perhaps precisely so that the actual outcomes would come as a relief. But there was and remains some debate about how certain the coalition leadership was that their battle plans and superior training and equipment would produce a quick victory that minimized coalition casualties. In any event, the strongly positive outcome for coalition forces did a great deal to ease public anxieties that had risen in advance of the fighting. 

So why did fewer deaths in Somalia raise a much stronger and much more negative reaction? David Rieff's book *At the Point of a Gun* (Rieff, David. At the Point of a Gun : Democratic Dreams and Armed Intervention. New York, N.Y: Simon & Schuster, 2005), though primarily a work of reportage and commentary, does bring the two battles into a comparative historical framework and observes that the positive outcome of Desert Storm (in terms of low casualties) is to some extent was led to the deployment of forces in Somalia and some of the negative reaction to what happened there. (As well as also setting up the terms of later NATO intervention in conflicts in the Balkans but also the Clinton Administration's refusal to intervene in Rwanda.) What Rieff observes is that the narrative among the public that developed was that humanitarian military intervention was a good thing--but that the public also came to believe in the proposition that the reasons had to be clear, the objectives plausible, and the use of force needed to be overwhelming but also matched to the objectives.

The Battle of Mogadishu was part of a conflict that the U.S. public knew very little about. What little they did know did not seem to predict a pitched battle with US forces or the rest of the UN mission. What the public did know was that the American military were there as part of a humanitarian mission, to protect food aid in a chaotic ""failed state"" following the overthrow of the Cold War dictator Siad Barre. To a significant extent, the shift in the emphasis of the UN command towards state-building and pacifying Somali combatants in the civil war escaped the notice of the US public--perhaps partly because the Clinton Administration did not see it as a high priority for communication.

That all changed due to the particulars of the battle itself. I think even now you're not going to find a better source for describing the particulars of the battle than Mark Bowden's well-known journalistic account, *Black Hawk Down*. Without going too deep into the details, the upshot in terms of the OP's question is that the US public did not expect the battle itself, they did not expect the US military to take casualties in what they understood to be a humanitarian mission, they did not know anything about the target of the attack (the faction leader Mohammed Farah Aidid). In relative terms, it was the worst casualities that a UN peacekeeping mission had suffered (I think ever, up to that point?) and bad in relative terms even for the post-Vietnam US military. 

I think the key to the OP's question is partly the unexpected nature of the battle, sparked by an operation that in retrospect seemed like the definition of ""mission creep"", but far more importantly the details as described potently by Bowden made all the difference. In contrast to the controlled ""video game war"" nature of a lot of Desert Storm's visuals, you had dead Americans being dragged through the street, you had desperate soldiers struggling to survive, and an overall impression of chaos and poor planning all on TV for domestic audiences to witness.

I'm not sure you need a deeply detailed comparative analysis beyond that difference, really: both in empirical reality and in cultural representation, the two conflicts simply looked and felt completely differently. Those 18 deaths in Somalia felt like something utterly different than the coalition deaths in Kuwait and Iraq."
AskHistorians,"What are some of the more unusual historical sources found that reveal the less ""dignified"" part of our ancestors' lives?

When the linguist Allen Walker Read was a young man going off on road trips throughout the US in the 1920s and 30s, he would document the graffiti written on the walls in bathrooms for the sake of preserving the dirty words that he found there. Due to the subject matter, he was not able to publish his work anywhere in the US, and in fact ended up paying a private press in France to print 75 copies, giving it a title that was intentionally difficult to parse for anyone who wasn't an academic: Lexical Evidence from Folk Epigraphy in Western North America: a Glossarial Study of the Low Element in the English Vocabulary. It wasn't more generally printed until 1977, when it was given the more succinct title Classic American Graffiti. The book itself is organized according to word, and if you have ever entertained the idea that people a hundred years ago were thoroughly prim and proper, the book will thoroughly disabuse you of the notion. Some sample entries:

Read would become one of the major advocates for the inclusion of profanity in dictionaries and for its serious study by linguists, including writing the first study of the word fuck, although without ever actually using the word in the article. His book would eventually be used by the Oxford English Dictionary as evidence for the usage of many words, and he was cited with some frequency for the first known appearance of many of the words and usages. Entries that make use of the book include: fuck, hose, jack-off, jazz, jerk-off, manhole, pee-pee, pisshole, pole, to pull one's pud, puss, shit, shitty, suck, and tit.

A brief aside, my other favorite source in the OED is something that is called Sex Maniac's Diary 1987, and it is used in the entry for the word dogging, which in the UK means, ""The practice of watching or engaging in exhibitionist sexual activity in a public place, typically a car park, esp. as part of a gathering arranged for this purpose."" When the OED was preparing to write the entry for dogging, they issued a call to the British public for the earliest evidence for its use in writing (along with a number of other words), and used them as a the basis for a show called Balderdash and Piffle. For the evidence of dogging, it was literally the diary that a woman kept documenting all of her sexual exploits throughout the 1980s, and because it was meticulously organized by date, it was the best verifiable source, compared to some other documents they found from other people involved in dogging that purported to be older but that couldn't be verified in any way. The earliest quotation was, ""Ravers wanting instantaneous action..can find comrades in the traditional dogging haunts of Great Britain."""
AskHistorians,"Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in 1431 and declared a martyr in 1456. How was this received in England, and what was the political context?","This, I’m afraid, is one of those questions that’s going to have a somewhat underwhelming answer. Nonetheless, it’s an interesting question, and one that touches on wider currents in the religious and political atmosphere of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, so it’s well worth a look. I’m going to divide your question into three distinct sections, some of which will be more detailed than others: firstly, looking at the English reception of Joan’s trial and execution, secondly, the reception of her 1456 Nullification Trial (this will be very short), and finally, the religious context of these receptions. We'll consider the political context here and there throughout, as it's pretty inseperable from the events themselves.

The English response to Joan’s trial and execution is somewhat predictable, since they were one of the motivating forces behind it. To put it simply, they were pretty happy. That said, it’s important not to overstate this. Henry VI wrote a letter to the prelates of France on the 28th of June 1431, informing them of the outcome of Joan’s trial, and urging them to:

>‘make these things known by public sermons or other means for the good and praise of our holy faith, and the edification of the Christian people who have been deceived and abused for a long time by the works of this woman.’

This was to ensure that:

>‘no one among the people entrusted to you may presume to believe lightly in such errors and dangerous superstitions, especially in the present time when we see many false prophets and troublemakers holding damnable errors and mad belief…’

This letter is essentially a propaganda effort by the English to both disseminate the news of Joan’s death, and to enforce their own narrative, that of her as a heretic and false prophet. However, while this was the public face of the English position, the end of the above quote alludes to some of the factors that we will touch upon below, and suggests that the execution of Joan was perhaps not as much of a big deal to the English at the time as we might think it was today.

This is an impression further re-enforced by the tract *Contra ducem Burgundie*, by Jean de Rinel. This was written in 1435, as the alliance between the English and the Burgundians was coming under increasing strain. This text was intended to demonstrate the validity of the English claims to the throne of France and dissuade the Duke of Burgundy from reconciliation with the French King Charles VII. In it, de Rinel broadly recaps the events of the Hundred Years War to date, and Joan gets a very brief look in:

>‘This peace \[the Treaty of Troyes\] both during the lifetime of King Henry \[the Fifth\], father of our lord the present King, as well as since his death, has given a bought to the people of this realm very great fruit, because for a long time, the countryside of France, Picardy, Champagne, Brie, Burgundy and other regions enjoyed such peace, justice and tranquillity that each person might work, travel, and earn a living in safety, until the enemies and adversaries entered and put forward an uncontrolled woman, a sorcerer, idolater, and heretic, who was justly burned for her horrible crimes.’

That’s all de Rinel says on Joan, and he then goes on to discuss the more important point, which is why the Duke of Burgundy should not make peace with Charles VII. This speaks to both the English response and the political context of Joan’s trial – it was a symbolically significant moment, but in terms of the actual prosecution of the war, it was largely insignificant next to more momentous concerns such as the stability of international alliances, or the issues of supply and funding for the English possessions in France crossing the Channel.

The actual impact of Joan’s action on the Hundred Years War is a matter of ongoing debate. The Duke of Bedford, the English Regent of France, seemed to think that she had made quite a difference when he wrote to Henry VI in 1434 to ask for more money and resources to defend the English holdings in France. Bedford wrote that though the English had initially been very successful in their conquest of France,

>‘Everything prospered there for you until the Siege of Orleans, undertaken by God knows whose advice…\[After which\] there fell by the had of God a great stroke upon your people there, caused in great part, I think, by a lack of proper belief and by unlawful doubt aroused by a disciple and follower of the fiend called the Pucelle, who used false enchantment and sorcery…Her strikes and complete victory not only greatly reduced the number of your people there by also drained the courage of the remnant in marvellous ways and encouraged your adversary’s party…’

Bedford suggests here that Joan’s impact on the morale of the English forces was considerable, but it’s worth noting the context in which he’s writing. As he was after more resources, it was in his interest to play up the gravity of the situation in France at that point and showcase the (potential) results of not providing the aid he requested. It’s instructive to note that as Taylor points out, in a similar letter from 1430, Bedford made no mention of Joan whatsoever when summing up the recent events of the war.

Overall, the English response to the 1431 trial was generally to use it as a propaganda tool to attack the legitimacy of Charles VII’s government, rather than to celebrate it as a decisive victory over the French. Joan’s influence and impact on the progression of the Hundred Years War was perhaps more symbolic than material, and while it marked a downturn in the English fortunes, it did not prove a decisive turning point – the war ground on for another 25 years, and far more significant to the failure of the English to safeguard their French possessions were the reconciliation of the Duke of Burgundy to the French crown, the death of the Duke of Bedford in 1435, and the reform of the French army in the 1440s. The trial of Joan was useful as English writers could then formulate attacks to Charles VII within a religious, as well as political register, but it didn't mark a significant event in the overall English (or French) fortunes.

The English response to the Nullification Trial of 1456 is far more straightforward, as essentially, there wasn’t one. To offer a slight correction to your question, the Nullification Trial did not declare Joan a martyr, which was a specific category of religious identity – all it did was nullify both the legitimacy and the verdict of the original 1431 trial. Joan was innocent, but that was as far as it went. In fact, no one seemed to have been particularly interested in this result. Taylor argues that for Charles VII and the French, ‘the primacy goal of the Nullification Trial may not have been to restore the reputation of the Pucelle but to expunge the legacy of collaboration with the English and to give added substance to her dream of a unified France.' The results of the Nullification Trial were published in Rouen, but efforts were taken to prevent any veneration or creation of a cult of Joan following the verdict, and it was not more widely publicised. The fact that the French made little-to-nothing of Joan’s exoneration meant there was no need for an English response. Furthermore, by 1456, the English holding in France were almost entirely eliminated, with the exception of a small holdout in and around Calais. The English defeat at Castillon in 1453 marked pretty much the end of English ambitions in France, and by 1456 the English were starting to get embroiled in the Wars of the Roses, so a refutation of what was essentially a minor ecclesiastical legal judgement was not really top of anyone’s list. By this point, it simply didn’t matter what Joan had been – saviour or heretic, divinely or diabolically inspired. Charles VII was the undisputed King of France, there was no suggestion of any further English military undertakings, and the attention of the English aristocracy had been firmly turned inwards by the politics of Henry VI’s reign. We have no sources (at least that I’ve encountered) that offer any English comment on the Nullification Trial, and honestly, even the French sources are sparse. After 1456, Joan essentially disappeared from wider public discourse until the mid-nineteenth century, when the case for her formal canonisation was first advanced.

AskHistorians,"In the US, why are there so many cities with names ending in -Ville or -Burg but almost none ending in English suffixes like -Ham?","I'm not quite sure I agree with the premise of your question. -Ville is likely drawn from French place names, but French and English place name etymology is closely linked, and speaking French as a second language remained popular in English and the US, and was still quite prominent in times of US expansion. -Burg and its derivatives comes from German and is most heavily concentrated in Pennsylvania, where a significant amount of German-language immigration took place in the late 18th and 19th centuries. -Polis is also popular, coming from Greek, and quite a few American cities have Latin or Spanish roots as a consequence of colonialism and trade. We might even go so far as to argue that -ham is itself derived from French, not from English, though it saw a lot of use in placenames in England.

-Ham, as in a truncation of hamlet, is a lot less present than -burg, you're right about that, but -ham is hardly the only English-derived suffix for place names, even if we don't count -ville. There's also -ton, the truncation of town, and if we combine -ton and -town it might be the most common place name suffix in the country. There's also -shire, -wich, -wick, -pool, -ford and a variety of other indicators of English or old English descriptors. But the suffixes alone also don't tell the whole story, there are a variety of ways that a place name can be stamped with an English-language origin other than with suffixes. Plenty of American cities are just *new* something or other, directly named after English cities and towns, and some take the ""new"" out entirely and just settle a new place and call it the same as its progenitor. Others still are named after individuals, for instance various cities named Washington or Jackson, with or without ""city"" (or -polis or -ton) added to the end.

This is mostly just a brief survey of place names in the US without much analysis. Patterns of growth and settlement are highly complex and highly regional, with waves of immigration concentrating in small areas or diffusing out into the frontier. Different areas of the country were settled at different times by different people operating in different intellectual, linguistic, political, and religious contexts. Some entire towns could be non-anglophone for long periods of time. Michigan was largely francophone for decades after it became a territory of the United States and remained so even after it became a state. More French speakers remained in communities along the Mississippi river and delta. Towns on the so-called frontier in various states were settled by German immigrants, placing German linguistic communities all over the continent, such as Fredericksburg, Texas, which was a largely German-speaking community until after the US Civil War. Large scale immigration patterns in the late 19th century brought more and more immigrants from non-anglophone countries, which also impacted regional place names in their preferred areas of settlement. 

We should also mention, of course, that indigenous place names heavily mark the United States. Place names deriving from Algonquin languages are extremely common around the Great Lakes region and east coast, and other indigenous languages influence the regional place names of other areas, as well.

/u/abbot_x has written more in-depth about the etymology that I misappropriated [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y8tav1/in_the_us_why_are_there_so_many_cities_with_names/it3e2jo/), but it seems to me that English wields a pretty considerable influence on place names in the United States, but place names have always reflected a complex interplay of history and culture, especially in periods of expansion and settlement.

During the Cold War what were the worst abuses of KGB power? How does it compare in lethality to the CIA? Which agency killed more innocent people?","So personally I'm not sure we can really just do a balance sheet for comparison, and I would suspect things get really murky very fast. Does the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem count because the CIA supported the South Vietnamese coup plotters, or does it not count because the CIA recommended Diem's exile, and Kennedy was reportedly very shocked when news of Diem's death reached him?

But anyways, I wanted to give a little background on the KGB specifically. Mostly because it really isn't accurate to even assume it's the equivalent of the CIA - the KGB was *much* larger an institution, and its predecessor organizations even larger than that. 

A brief history of Soviet secret police forces is here. After gaining power in 1917, the Bolsheviks organized the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (known by it's Russian Initials CheKa - intelligence forces to this day in Russia often get called Chekists). It was superceded in 1922 by the State Political Directorate (GPU) which became the All Union State Political Directorate (OGPU) the following year. *That* became the State Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) in 1934. The NKVD was then split into a Ministry of Internal Affairs and a Ministry of State Security in 1946, and the MGB was renamed the Committee of State Security (KGB) in 1954. 

So already it's a little hard to talk about a comparison, because are we *just* talking about the KGB, or its earlier iterations back to 1917? In contrast, the CIA was formed in 1947, and had a temporary wartime antecedent in the Office of Strategic Services during 1942-1945. 

The NKVD in particular is of note because if we're including it, then we're not just including secret police and spy services, but a larger organization that contained those functions and basically all criminal and judicial functions in the USSR. The NKVD carried out the Great Purges of the late 1930s, which saw hundreds of thousands of executions and millions of gulag sentences (and the NKVD ran the gulag system as well). I have written more on the gulag system [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tk94yc/what_makes_a_gulag_well_a_gulag_why_do_we_call_it/i1pclgq/), and on gulag mortality [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l4p2of/official_soviet_records_for_gulag_deaths_are/gkq41ff/) - most historians put the gulag death total around 1.5 to 1.7 million people.  The NKVD also had its own internal troops that among other things brutally put down insurgencies in the Baltics and western Ukraine after World War II, and was directly involved in building similar regime institutions in Eastern Bloc countries. I have written about the insurgencies in the western Soviet Union after 1945 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/d8yrgy/proportionately_the_number_baltic_guerilla/f1eqfwm/)., and some background on the Soviet control of Eastern Europe in the 1940s and 1950s [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f286yu/why_did_the_wwii_allied_powers_allow_the_ussr_to/fhbojrx/).

Even if we just focus on the slimmed down KGB of 1954-1991, it had a *vast* array of directorates responsible for many aspects of Soviet rule: foreign intelligence, counter-intelligence, military counter-intelligence (basically - the political officers in the military), transportation security, cryptography, 40,000 security personnel for CPSU leaders and for sensitive installations, the Soviet Border Troops who numbered about 250,000 in the late 1980s, a wide variety of research and development sites, control of the telephone lines, and several special operations groups like Alpha Group and Vympel Group, as well as republic-level KGBs in each of the non-Russian SSRs. Even the FSB of today's Russia doesn't have nearly this kind of reach, as the Russian portions of the KGB was broken up into a number of ""power ministries"" after 1991. The FSB has only been able to consolidate some of these under its umbrella. I have an answer as to what happened to the KGB with the fall of the USSR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9lna01/how_did_yeltsin_gain_control_of_the_armypolice/e788qwv/), and some information on the post-Soviet ""power ministries"" [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tg7641/how_genuine_was_boris_yeltsins_democratic_reforms/i11pfki/).

I point this out because while the KGB was an opponent of the CIA in foreign espionage and in special operations, the KGB did vastly more, and is comparable to the CIA, NSA, FBI, Border Patrol, and Secret Service, plus other functions like censorship and control of communications networks that the US doesn't really have a federal governmental agency for."

AskHistorians,"Why did Malyasia and Indonesia (and Brunei) end up as separate states after decolonisation, rather than a single state? Both regions have Malay as a lingua franca, long histories of connection, and a shared border on Borneo. Was it just continuity from the colonial period, or was there more at work?","There's a lot of posts talking about the Anglo-Dutch treaties and all, but I think not tackling the key points of why Indonesian and Malayan nationalists in the critical 1945-1960s period do not see their interests aligned. 

First, by population, **the entire region is mostly Java**. The [1961 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Indonesian_census) gives Java and Madura island a population of about 63 million (out of 97 million total for Indonesia). In contrast, peninsular Malaya ex Singapore had a total population of 6.2 million (Singapore: 1.4m) in the 1957 census. Although Malaya and Java look about equal areas on a map (peninsular Malaya is in fact slightly bigger), one had an order of magnitude more people than the other. 

So whilst Sukarno might have desired Maphilindo, Malaya would be choosing whether to become another one of Java's outskirts. It is not a marriage of equals; Malaya cannot have any expectation that Java would shape its policies around it. If 1950s Java politics slides toward the communist leg of Sukarno's three-legged chair of NASAKOM, and the predominant communist force in Malaya is not favourable to Malayan nationalists, then well too bad for the Malay nationalists. This will make sense later, I promise.

Second, by ethnic composition, in the critical period, **peninsular Malaya was not, in fact, majority Malay**. [There were more Chinese in Malaya than Malays!](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/wnpsr6/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/ik7zyyt/)

The problem had already affected Japanese decisionmaking during the war:

>Although the Japanese Army administered Malaya as a colony throughout the war, Tokyo did consider the question of granting independence to Malaya. In February 1945 a study group in the Political Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs examined the possibilities of granting independence to Malaya, and in a working paper suggested three possibilities (1) to incorporate the four sultanates of Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Perlis^1 into Thailand^2, and the rest into China^3, (2) to grant autonomy through the creation of a political administration with the cooperation of *the Chinese, the main race in Malaya*, and the Malays... and (3) to make Malaya a state of a federated Indonesia. 

>The incorporation of the four northern sultanates into Thailand^4 had already occurred in October 1943. The idea of integrating the remaining states of Malaya into China was based on a change in the colony's demographic balance following the transfer of the four northern states into Thailand. The Chinese population thereafter constituted 47 per cent, the Malays 34 per cent, and the Indians and others 18 per cent. Based on these estimated figures, the study group concluded that the ""main race"" in Malaya was the Chinese...

Cheah, BK (2012), Red Star Over Malaya: Resistance and Social Conflict During and After the Japanese Occupation, 1941-1946 (Fourth Edition)

*^1 only recently annexed from Thailand in the 1909 Anglo-Siamese treaty
^2 allied with Japan since 1940
^3 meaning the collaborationist Wang Jingwei government
^4 retrocessed by British insistence after the war, which reduced the Malay demographic disadvantage but did not eliminate it*

Compare Japan's appointment of Sukarno to the occupation-period Central Advisory Board and creating the Indonesian volunteer army Pembela Tanah Air in 1943 - upon Japan's surrender in 1945, Sukarno is in a position to declare independence in two days and has an army to fight the returning Allies with. But on the Malayan side, when Ibrahim bin Yaacob of the likewise collaborationist/socialist/anticolonialist Kesatuan Melayu Muda is rallying to oppose the British landings, he does not have a national podium or a national army, only a seat on an ethnic consultative advisory board. After all, he's not representing the main people in Japanese Malaya! And his militias - the Malayan branches of Pembela Tanah Air - are instead rallying to fight the Chinese-communist-aligned MPAJA's militias^5 . In Indonesia, thousands die fighting the returning Allies; in interregnum Malaya, hundreds die in Malay-Chinese clashes before the British so much as show up. 

*^5 although the Chinese civil war had not yet ended in the mainland, the communist-aligned MPAJA had routed the nationalist-aligned OPAJA during the Japanese occupation*

This would continue to have a critical impact on nationalist priorities in the wake of the war. For Indonesian nationalists, the priority in 1945-1949 was expelling the Dutch puppet states. 

But for Malayan nationalists, the dominant non-British armed force in Malaya after the war would continue to be the Chinese militias. So the priority was **containing the Malayan Chinese**, which *required* British 
enforcement of prewar traditional Malay lands and privileges to protect against encroachment of Chinese settlers. The central question is not what to do with the British - who have already committed to eventual independence of British Malaya; recall the British let go of India with more speed than the Dutch let go of Indonesia; whether it would eventually happen was not really in doubt - but **how to do so without becoming a Chinese outpost**.

Malay nationalists were extremely opposed to independence on any terms which would de facto render them to lose these rights. e.g, this took the form of a massive campaign of civil disobedience by conservative Malay nationalists against the 1946 Malayan Union^6, until replaced by the 1948 Malayan Federation which formally restored the rights and privileges of the Malay states and Malay royalty. As the star of conservative Malay nationalism in Malaya rose, the appeal of prewar socialist Malay nationalism fell - by 1949, when the regional dynamic takes a marked shift with the Dutch withdrawal, the end of the Chinese civil war in a massive communist victory, and the start of the Malayan Emergency, socialist Malay nationalism in Malaya is moribund; socialism is instead synonymous with the prospect of Chinese domination. And so ended any prospect of union between increasingly-conservative Malay nationalism and increasingly-socialist Indonesian nationalism.

*^6 leading to the founding of the dominant party of Malay nationalism, the United Malays National Organisation, or UMNO, which would subsequently govern the country from 1957 to 2018*"
AskHistorians,"Why did Christianity spread to the Amhara and Tigray people in Ethiopia in the early 4th century but it didn’t spread to the Somalis,Oromo,Afar or other Cushitic groups during that time frame?","Great question!

Christians _may have been_ present in Danakil and Somaliland regions along the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden coast in the 4th century.

Dr Sada Mire is an archaeologist, and she wrote that there is evidence of christian burial grounds at Aw-Barkhadle northeast of Hargeisa. She also mentions individual cruciform megalithic burials at various locations in Saahil and Hargeisa regions.^1 Aside from burials, she also mentions cultural practices suggestive of past Christian devotion. For instance, pilgrims who visit the burial site of Saint Aw-Barkadle are known to use powdered chalk to mark their foreheads with crosses during their visit.^2

Aweis A. Ali also puts forth arguments that there were Christians in the Somali peninsula from the 7th century onwards (Dr Mire thinks they are present from 4th century). He cites accounts from Muslim scholars al-Mas'udi, al-Biruni and al-Idrisi in the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries who all identify the port of Zeila as having a mostly Christian population, with only a few Muslims. However, al-Maghribi writes in the 13th century Muslims are a majority of the population of the city, and Ibn Battuta confirms this in his visit in the 14th century.

Aweis Ali also points to the tradition of Christianity on the island of Socotra which is traditionally traced to Saint Thomas the Apostle. He points to accounts from Marco Polo and the missionary St Francis that describe the inhabitants of Socotra as Christians (perhaps Assyrian church maybe influenced by Ethiopian Christianity?) as late as the 16th century.^3

Regarding Afar peoples, it is much harder to find information. From a few days searching, most information about Danakil depression and Afar people focuses on more recent time. There is unfortunately also a great deal of search contamination because many journal articles use the idiom ""the view from afar"".  What I can say is that there was certainly trade in ivory between Ptolemaic Egypt and Afar in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. The ivory trade was still active in the 4th century AD, though Afar peoples/the Danakil region were in the trade orbit of Aksum-Adulis. Could there have been minor but direct trade contacts between Afar and Egypt in 4th century that would have Christian merchants and missionaries? Or was all trade from Afar routed through Aksum in a monopolistic manner? Hard to say because our sources and archaeological investigation has focused on Adulis and Aksum. Archaeology in Danakil coast is comparatively neglected.

Regarding Oromo peoples, Mohammed Hassen says that Oromo peoples migrating north likely first encountered Amahara migrants travelling south in the Showa region in the 12th century.^4 Again like the Afar, there is not much/any information available about Christianity and the Oromo before the 16th century. Hassen says that Oromo traditional religion appears to be influenced by neighboring Christianity and Islam. For example, legends of a lost holy book. Or the serpent legend of Sapera.

If accept there were Christians in Somalia in the 4th century, the next question is ""why did the Tigray and Amhara Christianize and remain Christian when Somalis and Afar converted to Islam.""

To answer this, we need to understand a few things about the social character and organization of Christianity in the 4th century. 

Christianity in the Roman Empire in the 3rd century was overwhelmingly urban phenomenon. Although there were some elite converts, the largest mass of Christian converts consisted of artisans, merchants and craftsmen who constituted urban professional classes. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Christian church structures came to organize themselves in imitation of the structure of the Roman Empire. That is, large congregations in large cities (often provincial capitals) would be led by a Bishop who would also have authority over smaller congregations in subsidiary cities within the diocese (equivalent to a province).

So while Christian populations inside the empire initially spread organically as parts of ethnic diasporas or professional networks across cities, by the 3rd century it had become a top-down network where Patriarchs appointed bishops, and bishops appointed subordinate priests.

So, in the 4th century in the Red Sea, Christians remained important as merchants. E.H. Seland suggests that this prominence as merchants may have been because Christianity was a ""portable religion"" where practice was not geographically constrained. He also suggests that there likely was already a merchant community of Christians at Adulis before Frumentius and his brother Edesus arrived in the early 300s.^5

However, the appointment of Frumentius as Bishop of Aksum and the conversion of king Ezana circa 350 were important events which entrenched Christianity and facilitated the conversion of the broad swath of Aksumite population. Having a Bishop at Aksum made appointment of priests much easier and facilitated missionary activity throughout Aksumite imperial territory.

The earliest church histories that survive either come from Alexandria or the Levant, and they briefly but consistently mention Bishops at Aksum. But, from a perspective so far away they don't give us good visibility on what sort of diocesan authority Bishops of Aksum might have had over Christian communities at Zeila, Hargeisa or along the Somali coast. As for Ethiopian sources, there are insciptions at Aksum and Adulis, but they are quite limited. The earliest surviving Ethiopian manuscripts we have are from the 13th century, which copy earlier manuscripts and oral traditions. There is just not much information available from these sources about Christian communities in 4th-10th century along Somali coast.

---
However, I do want to say something about ""other Cushitic groups"". We do know that Christian missionary efforts did manage to convert Agaw (or Agau) speaking peoples to the south and west of Aksum. In the 6th century, the Alexandrian merchant and later hermit Kosmas Indicopleustes wrote of governors of ""Aksum and of Agau"", implying some awareness and evangelizing effort in the 6th century.  These conversion efforts were successful enough that the Zagwe dynasty ruled as Christian kings of Ethiopia from perhaps 950 to 1270.^6

AskHistorians,"What would life on a ship ""iced in"" looking for the Northwest passage have been like?","(PART ONE)
I can't speak super specifically to the Franklin Expedition but I can speak generally to activities that would have taken place on a ship that was trapped in ice for a long period of time during the 19th and early 20th centuries using a few examples. These situations are however fluid and often gradually become more serious survival situations where people aren't trying to keep busy as much as trying to stay alive.

What was available really heavily depended on what was brought with them from home, and what activities they partook in also depended on things like their overall health and morale, and the status of their supplies. Many searches for the Northwest Passage were somewhat ill-advised, to say the least, in that a lot of the expeditions didn't fully understand at the time that they could become trapped in the ice indefinitely. The Franklin expedition, which inspired The Terror TV series, was exceptionally optimistic and they did not think there was much uncharted territory that they would have to traverse before finding open water and their goal. Of course, that's not what happened, and details of what their day to day life was like during the expedition are scant since they did not return or leave much evidence behind of their activities.

Overwintering on the ice was incredibly difficult physically and mentally and the availability of leisure activities to keep crew spirits up could help a lot. The best chance of survival (and preserving the crew's mental/emotional well-being) came from expeditions that actually PLANNED to overwinter. This meant having some planned activities (musical instruments, books, potentially phonographs once those were invented and widely available, even sports equipment). Additionally, expeditions that planned to be gone over multiple years were more likely to be better provisioned with preserved food, fuel, matches, and guns/ammo for hunting and maintaining a supply of fresh food over a period of years. A steady supply of fresh meat could help ward off scurvy, and is a particular preoccupation of a lot of polar explorers -- diaries often go into great detail about hunting and the state of the meat supply. Preserved food was not as reliable as it is today, and in fact improperly preserved food may have been part of the Franklin expedition's downfall.

Of course, even well-supplied, it's hard to plan for the utter monotony of being trapped in polar ice for months or years at a time. During Fridjof Nansen's Fram expedition in the 1890s, Nansen tried to start a newspaper on board when the ship was trapped in ice in the winter of 1893, but he couldn't get the crew interested and the project died out. Crews often get preoccupied with minutiae such the direction of their ship's drift when trapped in ice, their latitudinal/longitudinal position, temperature and wind readings, etc. Some crews even placed bets over such things to pass the time (which may or may not have been permitted by their expedition leaders).

To answer your specific question about heating: portable stoves were used which could burn fuel such as alcohol and blubber. Blubber in particular was a very popular fuel because it was easy to get in polar regions by killing the local wildlife. It does produce a thick, greasy smoke and makes everything very dirty and stinky. This was typically used for cooking hot food. To stay warm, guys normally cuddled together indoors, though one ship (the HMS Investigator, which I'll talk more about a bit later), actually had a sort of central heating system called the Sylvester Heating Apparatus which burned coal -- but of course they only had the coal they brought with them.

Being well-provisioned also allowed for leisure time and activities in between regular duties, whereas expeditions that were not particularly well-provisioned usually occupied their days by being incredibly ill/starving and dying -- or, in the case of survivors, taking on the incredibly morose tasks of burying the dead and trying not to lose hope completely. Some expeditions were suspected of resorting to cannibalism or at least using human flesh as bait to try to catch edible sea creatures (Franklin's was one of these, so was the later Greely expedition of the 1880s). Survival work can take up a lot of time, and malnourishment causes a lot of physical symptoms that make that work difficult, so in more serious survival situations on a trapped ship, a lot of the day might be spent simply trying to make each other comfortable and stay warm or helping medical staff keep track of crew members' physical and mental conditions.

After the loss of Franklin's expedition, a new expedition was mounted to search for them, and they ironically ended up traversing the Northwest Passage themselves, which required a combination of travel on their ship and sledging. Their ship had to eventually be abandoned in Mercy Bay where its wreck remains to this day. This expedition was led by Robert McClure, and it was originally supposed to be a two-ship expedition, but the HMS Enterprise was separated from the HMS Investigator in a storm, and Investigator went off and did its own thing -- for over three years, which got McClure into a bit of trouble back home. However, they planned to be away for awhile, so in terms of provisioning they were pretty well-off for the bulk of their expedition, with things deteriorating pretty dramatically once their coal and stored provisions ran out. According to the expedition members' contemporary accounts, some of their activities (before supplies ran out and they were in a more dire survival situation) included religious services/reading the Bible, playing music (expedition members had a fiddle, a guitar, a flute, and apparently some music boxes), and playing a ball-and-bat game on the ice (presumably similar to baseball or cricket). In the Arctic, explorers also had interactions with the local Inuit populations which presented opportunities for trade and gossip. McClure's expedition had an interpreter who could speak local Inuit languages so they were constantly looking for opportunities to speak with locals and try to glean news about the fate of the Franklin expedition crew."
AskHistorians,"Disney's Pinocchio was released in February 1940. At this point, Italy had been under Fascist rule for decades, was closely allied with Nazi Germany, and would soon join WWII as one of the Axis Powers. Did the political environment impact the film's development and reception at all?","No.

(I have to hedge in terms of ""no"" on reception; none of the major review outlets mentioned it, but that doesn't mean someone, somewhere didn't write such a reaction down, or someone had a reaction but didn't record it. But we're safe in asserting no as a general reaction.)

Regarding why:

First off, it is important to note, unlike
_Bambi_, the book _Le avventure di Pinocchio_
(originally published in serial form in 1881), 
was an absolutely massive worldwide seller when
Disney first started to get interested; a family
friend had written him in 1935 calling it
""a masterwork full of episodes and fit to
be developed."" It was, while distinctly Italian,
also big enough to be International. Additionally,
while the author himself (Carlo Collodi) was easy to claim for Italy he was hard to claim for fascism; in his early career he made satirical
newspapers like _Il Lampione_ (censored by the government a year after publication, [samples here](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1867-0112-167-175)) and when he embarked on his children's work
he was generally bitter about the government.

Secondly, as the 1935 date implies, production began
early compared to WW2; it started in earnest in
1937, as a staff member (Bianca Majolie) made
a new translation of the novel and staff members
were encouraged to go see a play version. Animation got underway in January of 1938,
and while the process was a bit tortured (budget went to $2.6 million
compared to _Snow White_ with $1 million) Disney's main concern
was over the audience being sympathetic to the main character.
For example, in the original book version, the cricket dies rather early,
because Pinocchio crushes him with a hammer; he only appears later in the
story as a ghost. Production on _Bambi_ (by a Jewish Austrian author, I've written about it more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wqqlsb/bambi_is_a_strange_movie_by_todays_standards_its/)) happened simultaneously, and by all accounts Disney was more interested in that production than _Pinocchio_.

Certainly, by the invasion of Poland (September 1939) there wasn't room to provide major story changes, and the actors had already been cast and had been recording since late 1938.

Third, while the timing (February 1940 release) does suggest there would be _some_ European reaction there were virtually no translations done: WWII had shut down most chances for sending the movie over the pond, and the only translations that happened at the time were Spanish and Portuguese.

The English reviews were quite positive; from _Punch_:

>... is it better than Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? I think it is, much better, not in spite of (as at least one reviewer said) but partly because of the absence of so much conscious sentiment and charm.

There was some focus on the level of darkness of the story -- particularly of note is how the villains don't get ""defeated"" in any sense -- but not political analogies. Even reviews from England don't give mention of a political angle.

Ticket sales fell under expectations (Disney took a million-dollar write-off); the company wrote to its shareholders that the studio had ""suffered from excessive cost which was a direct result of the transition period through which the company passed when it changed its policy of making one feature in two years...to a policy of producing from two to four features a year as presently projected."" Really, the problem seemed to be _Snow White_ at the time was a one-off financially; while _Dumbo_ a year later made money, it was because costs were kept low rather than a spectacular groundswell of audience numbers.

AskHistorians,"From what I know, the Egyptian first dynasty started within a few hundred years of the Sahara finishing it's most recent event of drying up. Is this a coincidence, or did the desertification cause migrations that led to the rise of Egypt?","You're correct that the Saraha was desertified but recent research^(1) has suggested that rather than humans being driven into the Nile Valley solely as victims of desertification, they may have been partially responsible for it themselves. In his paper, David K. Wright argues that pastoral human grazing may have exacerbated a feedback loop causing a Dust Bowl effect that hastened the onset of the desertification faster than would have been achieved by natural processes. As the land was stripped and vegetation found it increasingly difficult to root, humans would have driven their livestock to other pastures and the effect would have followed them. Wright writes:

>Human-induced landscape pressures are as old as humanity itself. Although there is little doubt that post-Industrial anthropogenic activities have placed more global stress on the environment than for the millions of preceding years, human impacts are not concisely restricted to the post-Industrial world.

The Khormusan culture is one example of a people driven from the Sahara as it became increasingly arid, and whose archaeological remains demonstrate the culture's adaptability to new environments as they fled inland living for fishing and coastal/riparian settlements. There's even the suggestion that the Qadan culture, of similar origin, may have originated agricultural practices prior to their Near Eastern neighbours as a result of this forced change.^(2)

Others, like Jared Diamond's infamous *Guns, Germs, and Steel* suggested similar African geneses for agriculture, though his work is considered non-scholarly. More common consensus suggests that while these pockets of agriculture may have arisen spontaneously, the more sustainable practices likely arose in the Near East and were transplanted into fertile Egyptian soil by migrants. To quote from the abstract to Brace et al^(3) (emphasis mine):

>The data treated \[in this paper\] support the idea that **the Neolithic moved out of the Near East into the circum-Mediterranean areas** and Europe by a process of demic diffusion but that subsequently **the** ***in situ*** **residents of those areas**, derived from the Late Pleistocene inhabitants, **absorbed both the agricultural life** way and the people who had brought it.

It's important to note that Earth's orbital variances were always going to desertify the Sahara region.^(4) But the human intervention seemed to have hastened that effect, and the mass migration of diverse peoples into the Nile Valley created a crucible for civilisation to form. The addition of agricultural practices, whether spontaneous or introduced, then catalysed the process. All that was left was for Pharaoh Narmer to unify the regions under a single banner to create the First Dynasty a few hundred years later.

**TL;DR - yes but it's slightly more complicated.**

AskHistorians,In the 19th century German song “Morgen marschieren wir “ drinking tea and coffee with sugar are suggested as as way sto go to sleep. Were people back then built differently?,"The song is definitely ment to be joyful and not to be taken literal. These were songs soldiers sang while marching ment to keep morale and group affiliation up.  That being said, there might be another interpretation to this. If you listen to existing recordings of this song in almost all of them the first verse is:

Morgen marschieren wir  Zu dem Bauer ins Nachtquartier.   Eine Tasse Tee, Zucker und Kaffee,   Eine Tasse Tee, Zucker und Kaffee   Und ein Gläschen Wein,   Und ein Gläschen Wein!

In this context it sounds more like these soldiers are planning to have a cozy evening once they reached their night quarter.

The other version of the lyrics that you found could just be an alteration, for example from soldiers who made this up for fun."
AskHistorians,"How historical are the ""traditional Chinese dances"" practiced and displayed by the Shen Yun performing arts? They claim to be drawn from practices which are over 5000 years old.","They are, sadly, not traditional Chinese dances, but in order to make this a more complete answer, we can have some fun with it.

Let's start with that number - 5000 years. That's a very, very long time. Longer, in fact, than we have record of a Chinese language. The oldest written language in the area we consider China comes from the [Ruins of Yin](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1114/), where the capital of the Shang dynasty was in antiquity. Here we found oracle bones which are inscribed with a proto-chinese script. It is completely, 100% unintelligible to Chinese readers today, regardless of what script they read. However, these ruins date back to 1250 BCE, a far cry from the 3000 BCE attested by the Shen Yun dancers. 3000 BCE is *before* the pyramids in Giza were built by half a millennia. Suffice it to say, it was a long, long damn time ago.

Before the Shang however, there is tell of a [Xia dynasty.](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/imperial-chinas-dynasties/) The existence of such a dynasty is debated, and evidence for it is mostly from ancient sources, and those sources make some anachronistic assumptions about the Xia, such as them worshipping Heaven (天) when that was only adopted in the Zhou dynasty, after the Shang - who worshipped a God, Di (帝) - had fallen. Even then, the Xia were only purported to go back as far as ~2000 BCE, so we're *still* 1000 years short. 

Then you come to the issue of ""traditional"". The modern area of China incorporates an area that, historically, housed *hundreds* of different cultural/ethnic groups that all used their own mostly mutually unintelligible spoken languages (and script, prior to the unification of the Chinese written script under the Qin, although that's not *really* true either). It was not uncommon for a civil servant in China to speak 4 or 5 different languages - that of his home, that of the capital, and those of his post, as well as any others he would learn along the way. All of this to say that something being a ""traditional"" Chinese dance is like saying that a Russian squat dance (I believe called a Hopak) is a ""traditional"" European dance - and assuming people in Spain would be familiar with it.

This is the intellectual leap of faith you have to make to believe that Shen Yun dances *are* 5000 years old traditional dances - that somehow, despite the area being inhabited by hundreds of different peoples speaking dozens of different languages - mostly mutually unintelligible, throughout a vast and diverse area, over a history marked with instability, fracturing, and ever changing concepts of who and what is Huaxia - ""chinese"". Couple this with the fact that paintings and portraits were little more than stick figures for hundreds of years of early Chinese history, and the story can be pretty soundly put away as bogus. Whether or not they are rooted in more modern Chinese history i do not know, but would be excited to learn more about."

AskHistorians,"Where there any royals in history who actually married destitute peasants/commoners, like in the fairy tales?","There are many examples of this across many world monarchies. However, so far I have not seen any other users give any examples from medieval or early modern Western Europe, of which there are several. The most unusual may be the morganatic marriage of King Eric and Queen Karin of Sweden, a reflection of the uniquely dramatic and chaotic situation of the Swedish court in the middle 16th century.

Karin Månsdotter was queen of Sweden for about 6 months, from July 1568 to January 1569. Prior to this, she was simply a teenage servant in the king's court. Like many women and girls employed throughout history, Karin entered or was coerced into a sexual relationship with her older and more powerful employer, King Eric XIV of Sweden. Very unusually however, Eric and Karin chose to sanctify their relationship through marriage. 

There were two big reasons for this. First, King Eric suffered from a mental illness caused bouts of rage which not only trouble the court but caused severe instability among the nobility. In one notorious instance, he ordered the arrest of five noblemen on dubious charges of disloyalty. According to historian Gary Dean Peterson, King Eric made the shocking choice of *personally* killing at least some of these men, stabbing them to death in their prison cells. This act, and the broader crisis of Eric's violent temperament, was a huge crisis for the Swedish monarchy. Favored courtier Jöran Persson sought to assuage the king's mental illness by connecting him with somebody who could calm his violent tendencies, preferably a spouse or a mistress. 

An additional matter was that Eric's instability made him a weak and unpopular monarch among the nobility, particularly given that his execution of suspected traitors was popularly perceived of as a mass murder. Eric and his advisor Persson feared that marrying into a Swedish noble family or even foreign royalty would allow his new in-laws to dominate the court and harm the standing of both Eric and Persson. According to Sture Arnell's book on Queen Karin, after she became Eric's mistress, Persson identified the teenage Karin as a potential moderating influence on the unmarried 30-something king, and thought that this low-born servant could serve as an effective liason between the court and the nobles and the unstable king. 

Eric and Karin initially married in secret, through a morganatic contract that would not guarantee inheritance rights to their children. But after a year, potentially due Karin's successes at calming the king, the two had a second, conventional marriage and the servant Karin was crowned Queen of Sweden. 

This is not exactly a fairy tale story, as it involves a powerful violent man marrying a younger woman whose age and station makes her consent dubious in the situation. Accordingly, it does not have a fairy tale ending. Months after the second wedding and coronation, a group of nobles including Eric's own brothers rebelled against him. Eric was overthrown and the royal family, now including two small children, was held captive in a Finnish castle. They remained imprisoned for about a decade, and after several years of confinement together and the birth of two children, Eric was put into solitary confinement to prevent the birth of more children that could harm the claim of the usurper King Johan III. He died alone in 1577, upon which Karin and their children were freed but lived the rest of their lives in relative obscurity as members of the lower nobility."
AskHistorians,What was the reaction of muslim scholars to the discovery of language families?,"This is one of these times when the assumption posited by the question itself needs to be challenged. I will do my best in showing why the question should be challenged, then attempt to construct alternative forms of the question that might be more valid and answer those as well. 

To begin with, neither Islamic nor pre-Islamic Arabs believed nor claimed that their language was the first to exist in human history. The origin Arabs attributes to themselves divided Arabs into three segments: Ba’eedah (extinct), ‘aarebah (original arabs), and Must’reebah (Arabified). The belief in this division is well documented by, among many, Abu Baker Ibn Ishaq, Abu Almundher bin Hisham, Abu Abdullah bin Obaid, etc.

Traditionally, Arabified Arabs are said to be the descendants of Ismael, the son of Abraham; while original Arabs are the direct descendants of Sam, the son of Noah. The modern Arabic name for Semitic Languages reflect this belief as they are called اللغات السامية; Sam(ic) Languages. Importantly, Arabs did not believe that Abraham or Noah spoke Arabic.

Besides, even during early Islamic times, there was no one unified Arabic form. A fact which the Arabs at the time knew and acknowledged. I hesitate to call these other forms of Arabic as either accents, dialects, or separate languages because the distinction is usually political and out of the scope of this question. The prophet Mohammed PBUH is known to have spoken other forms of Arabic while communicating with caravans coming from distant Arab lands such as during the famous “Fasting while Traveling” hadith. No records exist at the time or after of any practitioners of any of the forms claiming that theirs is the one true form from which all others descended. The prophet himself was quoted to have called Abraham Syriac implying that he spoke the Syriac language.

Moving forward into Islamic times after the prophet, Ibn Hazem, an early islamic scholar, says the following: 

""We do not know which language Adam (peace be upon him) first used. \[...\] Some have said that it was Syriac, others have claimed it was Greek, some have suggested it was Hebrew, and some have argued that it was Arabic. Only God knows the truth, but what we understand and have certainty in that Syriac, Hebrew, and Arabic (the language of Mudar and Rabi'a, not the language of Himyar) are forms of one language that evolved and changed according to the changing settlements of its speakers. Hence, changes occurred in it like those that occur when an Andalusian tries to adopt the tone of the people of Kairouan, or when a Kairouan resident tries to adopt the Andalusian tone, or when a Khurasanian tries to adopt their tone. We find that someone who has heard the language of the people of Fass Balut, who are just one night's journey from Cordoba, might say that it is a different language from that of the people of Cordoba, and so it is in many countries. With the proximity of another nation, their language changes in ways that are clear to those who reflect upon it. Whoever contemplates Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac realizes that their differences are just like the changes in people's words over time, the differences between countries, and the proximity of nations, and that they are essentially one language. Once we understand this, we realize that Syriac is the root of both Arabic and Hebrew.""

Ibn Hazem discusses this for a few more pages, which are worth a read, displaying a clear understanding that Arabic and Hebrew are both descendents from another language. Ibn Khaldoon and even Ibn Taimiah have similar paragraphs discussing similar conclusions. 

So in short, Muslim scholars had no real reaction to language families because that was already one of most famous, if not the most famous, positions held among muslim scholars. What OP lists is an extreme minority opinion at best, and mere (muslim) folk tales at worst. If anything, it was merely a confirmation of what was already known.

Ignoring qualitative claims like “perfect language” and western concepts like “sacred language”, and focusing on the extreme minority of scholars who held some variation of OP’s claim. In Omdat AlQari by AlAyoni, he says that “Some folks claim that Adam PBUH spoke Arabic originally when Allah created him, then was switched to speak a Syriac tongue when he was brought down to earth from the heavens.” Two things to note here: First, AlAyoni’s tone here is dismissive of this opinion, which comes after a long discussion of the position listed above by Ibn Hazem and is mostly added for completion. Two, it is important to note, once again, that the difference between languages and the borders around them is entirely socially constructed, and changes over time. Therefore, who and what is Syriac at the time might be different from what is understood right now.

The abovementioned opinion existed in two parts, first a claim that Arabic was spoken at one point in time, then an explanation to an event that changed that. You can find other examples of scholars refuting claims that exist in such pairs. Another common one is that after the flood, Noah and his children woke up speaking a different language each in a manner resembling the Tower of Babel story. After the fact, Sam had his own language which his Samic descendents branched out many languages from including Arabic. 

Generally, there is an emphasis among muslim scholars to focus more on action-oriented claims rather than hypotheticals and creation myths. For example, a more interesting question than what language Adam spoke would be if all Muslims are required to try and learn Arabic since the Quran is written in Arabic. This preference towards action-oriented questions meant that such impossible to disprove claims like what language was spoken in the Garden of Eden are seldom discussed and given very little importance. 

There is a lot more to say about what importance is Arabic given by Muslim scholars, regardless of its origin. So I might come back to expand later."

AskHistorians,Wikipedia article: term to describe death of Tsar's family in 1918?,"This is quite a difficult question as you'll get very different answers depending on what 'side' you ask. In my experience, historians focusing on the family themselves will refer to it as ""murder"" while historians focusing on the wider revolution often call it ""execution"". Though (and this is **anecdotal**) most works I read on either subject, papers or popular history books, do lean towards ""murder"". 

It also won't surprise you when I say that 'authoritative works' on any aspect of the last Romanovs are an absolute minefield. Massie is generally a good shout, if a bit outdated, and falls on the murder side. I'd hesitate to recommend Rappaport or Sebag-Montefiore just on principle, though they are currently the most popular Romanov historians and I *believe* that they both call it a murder. Papers on this exact subject are difficult to come by, but Lisa Kirschenbaum and Wendy Slater generally use murder and execution respectively (which, as a sidenote, is interesting because Kirschenbaum's usual focus lies later in the century). Azar and the historians in her circle always use ""murder"", and I find that their work is some of the best out there. 

I am personally of the opinion that folks over at Wikipedia have made the right call. Execution implies legality which is very murky here. But regardless of that, most historians of which I am aware do tend to lean towards the use of ""murder"" so that they don't have to navigate the semantics of ""execution""."

AskHistorians,"Modern cooking feels impossible without oil. When was it ""introduced"", if that makes sense?","The first evidence we have for vegetable cooking oil is from the 4th millennium BC, so we've been using cooking oil for over 5,000 years. Animal fats might have been used for cooking much earlier than that.

Oil was probably used as an ingredient added to dishes rather than as a cooking medium, at first. Frying and deep-frying probably followed as later uses. For example, in our oldest collection of recipes (the Yale culinary tablets, Old Babylonian recipes from about 1700BC) fat/oil is added to many dishes during cooking, but isn't used for frying.

We still have multiple dishes made without adding oil, and multiple cooking methods not using oil as a cooking medium (e.g., baking, roasting, steaming, boiling, grilling). But yes, for the full range of modern cooking, fat/oil is an essential ingredient and an important cooking medium.

AskHistorians,"If I bought some tea in Europe in 1800, the leaves would have come in a compressed block which I would saw off into boiling water to brew. Would this tea taste good by modern standards? Is it significantly different than the tea we drink today?","Since most of the populated parts of Russian Empire were in Europe I can answer it. Russian tea culture started in 1600s, flourished in 1700s and by the end of the century the trade was so massive that it become ubiquitous. Since my main sources are in Polish I must move it several decades (between 1830s and 1850s) but the question of the taste remains the same.

Probably you wouldn't like it.

It was affordable, but contemporary guides for housewives warn about rampant adulteration-  gypsum added to increase weight (but a sample, then burn it, if ashes weight more than 5% then it's fake) or even worse- Prussian blue used to dye green tea ( hang a sample in a muslin bag, pour hot water slowly, watch carefully for traces of the dye appearing)  that probably was one of the causes of comparatively small popularity of it. Brick tea is mentioned as a curiosity, not available in shops. 

So we are left with black teas- colonial store goods boast about various blends but probably the greatest question the owner would ask you would be ""English or caravan"". On the surface- it differed between more expensive English imported teas brought by sea and Russian ones transported by caravans either from China or domestic plantations in Georgia. By 1840s time caravan tea would specifically mean a specific blend of  teas. Legend says it's specific taste was caused by smokes of the fires kept by night, but the plain truth was that some of the leaves used in it were smoked over pinewood.

So you have your domestic tea- if you ask 1867 advice book about modern househols it will tell you to take one teaspoon for every guest, pour over boiling water (cup for person) and leave it to make an essence. Then you can take your samovar (a kind of water heater) if you are rich or a kettle if you are poor to prepare hot water to dilute essence. Ask your guest how strong they prefer, pour it personally.

It's very dark, bitter, strong and very, very smokey- no wonder it was uniformly sweetened with sugar, marmalade, fruits and nationality politics. You can technically drink with milk if you want to be seen as Anglophile.

But you would probably reach for sugar. Crystal ones- fine sugar was seen as unhygienic and my guides advice to use crystal ones, preferably freshly broken from the sugarloaf.

But you are in central Europe, in time of the birth of the modern nationalism, so everything, including way you drink your tea can be seen as a demonstration.

That's not a joke.

If you are Polish you put it in the tea and wait for it to dissolve. If you are educated Russian- you do it the same way. But if you are a Russian official who is forced to mingle with Poles that you want to show your disdain to, you can sweet it and drink as Russian peasants- but putting pieces of sugar in your mouth and *slurping it*.

Be careful thought- Poles will probably smile politely, but your superiors may see it as tacky and unnecessarily stirring the mood. If you are newly promoted Russian officer and you must have something in your mouth- take a spoonful of jam or bite a candied fruit, discretely.

Around 1870s home guides started to advise adding slices of citruses like lemon or oranges. They were fancy and neutral. (Way to economize- cover them in thin coat of fresh egg white, leave to dry, then you can store them for months in sawdust)

Or just go to teahouse and have your samovar brought you your table with basket full of cakes- they are clean, elegant and as one of the first establishments that hosted to ladies without male chaperones (you would be seated in separated ladies room)

AskHistorians,Why did men during the Civil War era wear their jacket with only the top one or two buttons closed?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"Why were Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Victoria painted wearing crowns, while no kings before or after them wore crowns in their portraits? Why is it so rare for kings to wear crowns in their portraits?","Hey! I'm an art historian with a research specialisation in early modern portraiture and I also work in a museum about royal history. While it's hard to bring one clear answer to this I might be able to provide some context and further knowledge. 

- There are plenty of portraits of monarchs of both sexes wearing crowns, from Queen Elizabeth I, Charles I, Charles II, George VI, and abroad as well - Catherine the Great, Oscar II of Sweden, lots of Holy Roman Emperors, etc. 

But when investigating if and why crowns were or were not worn in royal depictions, and if female monarchs were more or less likely to wear them, we can consider the following. 

- We must take into consideration the functions of portaiture and the function of crowns as well as consider different uses and needs of both through history. 
While part of the symbolism and regalia of monarchy, a monarch doesn't always wear their crown. In fact, the crown as an item is historically highly linked to the coronation, which only happens once. Depictions that feature them are often coronation portraits and the likes where the monarch is presented with parts or all of their regalia (apples, keys, swords, scepter, etc). This regalia is meant to embody and embue the different parts of divinely appointed kingly power with which the monarch in question has been bestowed. But with how the coronation and anointing works the monarch themselves is not ever actually required to display the items to be considered as such. The regalia, of which the crowns always are part, are thus symbols of state and monarchy but do not need to be physically worn by the monarch to serve that function. That way it often suffices to just have them on a pillow next to you in a portrait which is perhaps the most common through history. The fact that they are included in a portrait at all is indicative enough of monarchy as nobody else but the monarch is allowed to even associate themselves with their symbolism and definitely doesn't have access to them in a way that allows them to be painted.

- Now to consider some of our biases in depictions of the jewelry itself. There's a difference between state crowns and tiaras or diadems. The very fact that women have traditionally worn tiara and crown type jewelry as, well... jewelry while men have not means that there is a whole range of tiaras and diadems in royal collections that female monarchs wear as top-woman-in-case rather than as monarch-in-case. The best example of this for QEII is The Girls Of Great Britain tiara which has come to be closely associated with her and was featured in a lot of depictions but has no state function and is technically just a piece of jewelry that she owned and liked. As for actual royal crowns the monarch only officially wears the St. Edwards crown once for their coronation ceremony (and then possibly again in private for painting of coronation portraits, but it's extremely heavy so I doubt anyone wears it more than they have to.) The Imperial State Crown (that rested on the coffin of QEII) is then used once every year for the opening of Parliament. This means that many depictions of Queen Victoria and QEII may be depictions of them in other pieces of jewelry that are not state crowns, that they wear simply because it is what is customary for royal women to wear and that this skews our perception of their image as more often including a crown type item on their heads. In terms of fashion history royal women didn't really wear tiaras before the early 19th century, which means that most of the time between then and now has seen a female ruler on the British throne. This includes what I would deem the golden age of tiara making and wearing of around 1870-90.  

- Now onto the function and method of portraiture: Queen Victoria and QEII both lived in a time where the meaning of portraiture underwent an enormous change. Photography became an increasingly widespread medium during the first few decades of Victoria's reign, and digital photography became widespread during the reign of Elizabeth. This increased availability in practice meant that the role and conventions of royal imagery had to change when society was suddenly flooded with depictions. Through history portraiture (for state functions generally through the medium of oil painting) has been a privilege of the few, meaning that the pictures that were created were more compositionally curated and staged to include certain markers of royalty. Once photography entered the stage it became pretty clear that flying babies, naval warfare backgrounds or mysterious levitating drapery didn't work quite as well for an actual snapshot of an actual human being. This may have placed larger emphasis on the crown as one of the royal symbols that still translated well into this new medium. 

- With the new medium of photography and influx of imagery also came different means of visually linking certain persons to their functions. QEII is one of the most depicted people in history and the way in which she has been repeatedly painted and photographed has been done in a completely different way to how monarchs would have been depicted previously. Back in the 16th century QEI had Nicholas Hilliard and a select number of other painters standardise her ""mask of youth"" which was then repeated and copied - she definitely did not sit for every portrait we have of her. In the 19th century Queen Victoria had Winterhalter as her court painter and preferred having him paint her portraits for several years. For portraits like the George III you mention a court painter (In this case Romney) was appointed to produce an official image of the king and his studio would then crank out copies of that portrait to go around. All these examples mean that the picture of the monarch is copied and spread without their own participation in having to sit for every portrait as the point isn't to have a new creative expression but another copy of a chosen image. In our time royal portraiture works a bit differently. Queen Elizabeth II didn't keep a court painter responsible for her outward imagery but was instead likely approached by the artists or whoever commissioned a portrait by an artist, who then came to her and did their thing in their style. This means that QEII sat for countless artists and was depicted by a whole range of artists with different ideas and styles and visions and methods in a post-modern time where we see images differently and adhere to multiple traditions of style and expression as opposed to just one of ""this is the official depiction"". The official function of the crown itself depicting and conveying monarchy, with crown imagery and all, is now done by the official photography - think of the official portraits in embassies all around the world.

- As for the standard portrait of George III you mention - when there is question of a monarch choosing the style of their standard portrait to be copied and distributed it would have been a combination of the style of the artist, the preference and desire of the monarch as an individual, as well as and the conventions of portraiture and fashion at the time. George III was a pretty laid back guy and not really one for enormous shows of magnificence and it shows in how he chose to be depicted. Hanoverian kings also hadn't taken a huge interest in the arts. Charles II, in contrast, lived lavishly and extravagantly, and his personal preference definitely shows in his famous full-on seated portrait, where he does wear a crown (and a massive one, too!). He also had a lot to prove in contrasting the return of kingship and extravagance with the austerity of the Cromwell years. He had literally been welcomed back from exile to bring monarchy de luxe back into the game - and the style and manner in which he depicted himself needed to help him accomplish that. 

As you can see it's a very complex topic where our own biases, the needs of monarchy, the monarch themselves, technical developments, cultural trends, and fashion conventions may all play a part!"
AskHistorians,Artists of today are able to produce photo-real drawings with only a pencil and lots of time. Why is it we don’t have similar photo-real drawings from hundreds of years in the past?,"Frankly, the lack of photo-references, and more importantly - the lack of any concept of photography or curved lensing to reference. I'd encourage you to look up Andre Bazin's ""Ontology of the Photographic Image"" for more on how the introduction of light as an additive medium (photography, as opposed to subtractive mediums like paint and ink) reshaped how fine art is perceived and utilized. The flattening of 3-dimensional space into a 2 dimensional plane for comprehensive study and reproduction. 

The ""Photo"" part of ""photo-realism"" can be explored further, through a specific focus on lensing. The millimeter and curvature of the lenses involved in photography inform a lot more of what we perceive as ""photo-real"" than you would first think. For an analogous concept in principle, consider Escher's self portrait. He did, in a way create for himself a flattened image reference, as perceived by the curved lensing of 3D space, without the use of photography, and the results are similarly ""photo-realistic"".

[Anecdotally, my own partner was a talented but highly stylized illustrator before she started rendering photo references for her illustrations but now, even when drawing freehand, her art has permanently codified into a more photographic, less stylized approach, simply through practice, repetition, and comprehension of the physical and perceptual mechanisms involved with photography.]

Again, this returns to the Bazin essay, and the removal of ""The Painter's Hand"". Once a reference point for objective* reality was established, it allowed for the foundation of ""Photo-real"" as a style, like any other style before it. It wasn't for lack of talent, there are innumerable examples of nude model sketches and still life, and all manner of painting or illustration that are hyper-real, extraordinarily detailed, but the average artist simply hadn't thought to replicate reality as seen through a curved ~50mm lens before photography came along.

*Edit: An essential footnote I forgot to include. Bazin, a frenchman, uses the words ""Objective reality"" in a very specific way in his essay. The word he uses for ""Lens"" in French is ""L' Objectif"", the only thing that stands between subject and representation in photography."
AskHistorians,Why isn’t modern Egypt as powerful or influential as Ancient Egypt?,"The roots of modern Egypt can be traced to Egypt’s emergence from the Islamic Abbasid empire as an autonomous kingdom in the 10th century, with Islam as its majority religion and Arabic as its main language. It became the center of the Fatimid empire from 969. This was one of the largest empires in history at the time and was a major Mediterranean power. 

The Fatimid empire was replaced by the Ayyubid and Mamluk sultanates, from the 12th until the 16th century. During this time, Egypt was one of the most formidable states in the world and dominated the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean. It was the kingdom that defeated and ended the Crusades and also the one that inflicted the first Muslim defeat on the Mongols, and continued to check Mongol expansion into the Middle East for two centuries.  It also controlled the maritime trade between Asia and Europe until the Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope.

Egypt in that period was also the major center of Arabic culture. In the Fatimid era, Cairo replaced Baghdad as a cultural center, attracting many scholars and bureaucrats from Abbasid Iraq. The famous scientist Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized as Alhazen) served there. The famous Muslim philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun settled in Egypt in the Mamluk period and served as a judge and diplomat. He included a vivid description of Cairo (which he considered to be the greatest city in the world) in his autobiography.

Egypt declined in power after its conquest by the Ottomans in 1517, but returned to regional prominence in the 19th century under the dynasty of Muhammad Ali, who also conquered Syria and parts of the Arabian Peninsula and at one point attempted to conquer Constantinople. More importantly he was one of the first non-European rulers to attempt a massive modernization and industrialization program, and to base his power on a modern army conscripted from the general population. The project was largely dismantled after defeat by the European powers, who were alarmed at the possibility of a modern, militarily powerful Egypt replacing an enfeebled Ottoman empire. Nonetheless, Egypt remained at the forefront of modernization and westernization efforts in the Islamic world for the rest of the 19th century.

In the 20th century, Egypt emerged from the colonial period as the preeminent Arab state under Nasser and led the pan-Arabist movement. It was also the most influential culturally, in all spheres from cinema and literature to education and law. Neutralizing Egypt in the Arab-Israeli conflict was a key goal of American and Israeli policy, and this was fulfilled with the Camp David Accords in the late 70s.

Since then Egypt has declined as a political, economic and even cultural power due to a variety of geopolitical and economic factors, including the rise of the oil-producing Gulf Arab states. But these are all traceable to recent events and trends and nothing to do with the fall of Cleopatra. It is simply not true that Egypt has been weak or unimportant since the time of the pharaohs.

For good accessible overviews of Egypt’s history since it became part of the Arabic-Islamic worlds see:

AskHistorians,Why did Japan not have a grudge against the US following the atomic bombs?,"The American occupation of Japan went much, much better than Japan expected.

On April 1, 1945, the Americans landed in the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa and began working to occupy the islands. Japanese civilians overwhelmingly had total faith in the military authorities, who told them that the Americans were there to rape, torture and kill. The military told civilians that their duty was to kill themselves before the Americans reached them, and thousands obeyed.

> Some used scythes and razor blades to slash themselves, while others strangled themselves with lengths of rope. As the mayhem unfolded, they found all sorts of ways to kill, some bashing others to death with rocks and sticks. Men bashed their wives and parents bashed their children, young people killed the elderly and the strong killed the weak. What they felt in common was the belief that they were doing this out of love and compassion.
> 
> [Descent Into Hell: The Battle of Okinawa](https://apjjf.org/2014/12/48/Ota-Masahide/4230.html), Asia-Pacific Journal

Despite the fact that Japanese courts have acknowledged that these civilians were obeying military orders, Japan refuses to allow this to be mentioned in history textbooks. At that time, though, the propaganda was really this powerful, and local governments on the main islands were training women and children to fight Americans with sharpened bamboo sticks, which is still a well-known image in Japan today.

So when Americans arrived handing out chocolate bars to kids, with a seeming lack of interest in mass murdering civilians, it came as a shock to the system and it was very easy to forget the grudges of four years of war and millions dead. One Okinawan whom I read about recently recalled that just hours after her mother killed her sister, the Americans arrived smiling and offering food and clothing; her sister's death was never mentioned again.

Period diaries attest that at the very moment the emperor surrendered on August 15, it was already clear to everyone that something about the official messaging had not been accurate, and when the Americans actually arrived, the public very quickly understood that the government had been lying to them. The period under occupation, from 1945 to 1951, was transformative in Japanese politics, and although the Americans slowly guided prewar politicians back into power, the legal and social constitution of the country is still grounded in the experience of the occupation.

In this context, there was little inclination to blame the Americans for the atomic bombs or the equally deadly firebombings. There is a strong desire to remember the dead, but this is not simply nationalistic; Japanese people consider it part of their lesson learned from the war and their commitment to peace.

The Hiroshima nuclear disarmament and peace movement arose slowly in the years afterward, alongside the threat of nuclear war between the Soviet Union and United States. It did not emerge out of a grudge, and the most famous memorial of the bombing in Japan, a burnt-out exhibition hall in Hiroshima, was not preserved out of a sense of spite or to shame the Americans, but in honor of the victims and the desire to prevent war. In fact a similar building in Nagasaki, a burnt-out church, was dismantled, because the municipal government felt that to preserve it would have been too strong a reminder of wartime mistakes. The suffering of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was emphasized by the global disarmament movement in order to make the point that nuclear war should never happen again. (For details, see *Confronting the Bomb: A Short History of the World Nuclear Disarmament Movement* by Lawrence S. Wittner.)

Whether the Americans were right to drop the bomb is not something that Japanese authorities today take an official position on; as a matter of public opinion, the casualties of the bombs are felt to be victims of war first and foremost, with individual opinions on who was responsible for it."
AskHistorians,"In the infamously long wargame The Campaign For North Africa (estimated to take 1500 hours of play), Italian units need to be allocated more water because of their pasta habits. Was this a real thing? Did pasta affect the logistics of World War 2?","I am not an expert in the North Africa campaign or Italian military rations, but my graduate studies did include coursework in wargaming. That included examination and a playthrough of a separate ""monster"" World War II board game, and some discussion of ""The Campaign for North Africa."" The game is a bit of a legend.

The rule about the pasta water was explained by Richard Berg, the game designer, in a [2017 interview](https://kotaku.com/the-notorious-board-game-that-takes-1500-hours-to-compl-1818510912):

> ""The reality is that the Italians cooked their pasta with the tomato sauce that came with the cans. But I didn’t want to do a rule on that.”

The full article is worth a read. Berg's goal in designing the game seemed to not be to create the most precise historical recreation of the North Africa campaign, but to build a hyper-detailed experience that could satisfy or frustrate even the most avid gamer. If you had played other games and walked away wanting *more* granular detail, *more* rules, and an even *longer* playtime, then ""The Campaign for North Africa"" was there waiting for you.

Berg knew what he was doing when he added the pasta rule. If the player could conceive of another detail to include, Berg wanted it in there. [The rulebook](https://www.spigames.net/PDFv2/CampaignNorthAfrica.pdf) is almost 200 pages, if you'd like to find other oddities from the game.

Here's Berg again, discussing the playtime you've also referenced:

> “Has anyone completed the game? I think people have. But the point with The Campaign For North Africa was that it was kinda fun to play for a couple weeks or a couple months. After that? Get a life.”

And if we need to drive home the point with an even more pointed quote:

> “(The game) did what it set out to do,” explains Berg. “It was supposed to be an intensive eurythmic manual, and I think it functioned at that level. Is this game something you should sit down and play? No, there are plenty of good Africa games, unless you really want to get down to that level.”

Wargames do not necessarily have a single objective. The general public often believes that wargames are designed to produce realistic scenarios and outcomes, when in reality many (perhaps most) are not expected to be predictive. Historical wargames like ""The Campaign for North Africa"" have the advantage of dealing with more known variables than forward-looking games, but even then, the perception and reality of realism doesn't always line up.

The pasta rule of ""The Campaign for North Africa"" is an example of a detail that may not have faced a commander Libya in 1942. But the game and the silly rule does give you an experience that makes you feel as though you know what it would be like to be there. Mundane calculations over seemingly minor things can and do make the difference in large-scale military operations, and all of these have to be considered for successful planning and execution.

Playing ""The Campaign for North Africa"" doesn't mean you could step into the role of a World War II general and command the North Africa campaign. But it will sure give you the feeling that you could, or make you feel that you'd never want that responsibility. Which might be what Berg and his audience were chasing."
AskHistorians,"If William the Conqueror attended a modern (20th century & onwards) coronation, would the service be overly familiar to him (apart from the language)?","Fortunately, you've chosen one of the best documented medieval coronations. In 1067 the *Song of Hastings* was written, which aimed to glorify William the Conqueror and legitimise his rule. As part of that, its ending contains most of the coronation ceremony. And of course, we know what a modern coronation looks like because it happened yesterday. He would certainly recognise it as a coronation, but discounting the obvious things like language, buildings, technology etc. there are both substantial differences and similarities. Both followed the same basic structure: there was the procession, the acclamation, then the crowning, then the homage of the vassals. However, the minutiae were quite different. 

First, the procession. The modern coronation procession is, essentially, a military parade from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. Two aspects of the Conqueror's coronation were very different: it was much smaller and not militaristic. The *Song of Hastings* makes clear that there was a procession to ""St Peter's"". This is where I have to be a bit of a pedant, because there was a lot of talk during Charles III's coronation about how Westminster Abbey had been used since William the Conqueror for coronations. This is half true in that it was in the complex of buildings in Westminster that we now call Westminster Abbey, but the details are a bit more complicated. At the time there was a building there called ""St. Peters"", which is believed to be a building on the site of what is now Westminster Abbey (built by Henry III in the 13th century), but not much is known about it. To my knowledge, [this panel of the Bayeaux Tapestry](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.historytoday.com%2Farchive%2Fmonths-past%2Fedward-confessor-canonised&psig=AOvVaw0UII1M3uC-AuV_TDQLmlVB&ust=1683565963374000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCJCwsYza4_4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAP) is the only depiction of it, which just labels it as a church. So William the Conqueror might be surprised to learn that the Church of St Peter's is no more and one of his descendants built one hell of an abbey in its place. Fortunately, William only had to walk a few minutes around the corner from Westminster Palace to the Church of St Peter rather than a coach ride. 

As for the procession itself, the *Song of Hastings* makes clear that it was a clerical procession with the secular nobility and the people at the rear: 

> By his order the procession to magnify the Lord was organized, according to the usual and ancient custom, in double file. The monastic order and the clergy with their prelates make for the Church of St Peter. Crosses are borne before the procession of the clergy; and after the clergy follows the episcopal order. The king, escorted by a great concourse of counts and dukes and the applause of the people, comes last. A metropolitan bishop holds his right hand and another of the same rank walks on his left. In this manner, to the chanting of the *Laudes*, the king seeks the church and is conducted to the royal throne.

However, although there were Norman soldiers present during the coronation of the Conqueror for security, they do not seem to have taken part in the procession. Unlike the modern procession, it was absolutely *not* a military parade. Nevertheless he, like Charles III, entered the site of the coronation to the sound of chanting and singing flanked on each side by members of the clergy. 

After this, William would recognise only a few pieces of coronation jewel-encrusted stuff. There is a crown (we'll get to that) and a rod, but no jewel covered swords and fancy clothes, not even the golden robes he borrowed from Star Wars' Supreme Leader Snoke. Commentators and journalists like to say its all harking back to ancient tradition, but unless their definition of ancient is Charles II or the Georgians, then they are wrong, as that is all relatively modern. Almost all of the medieval items, except the spoon that holds the anointing oil and the chair, were destroyed by Cromwell. And even those medieval items were created at least a century after William the Conqueror was around, so the special spoon may have been a later thing as well, though we know there was oil. 

However, William would recognise the crown. Not because it's the same crown - not even close - but the idea of what it contains and what it should look like are pretty similar. As the *Song of Hastings* explains: 

> He ordered that a noble crown, one that was fitting, should be fashioned out of gold and precious stones by a craftsman. Arabia sent gold, the Nile gems from the river, and Greece dispatched a skilled artificer, one scarcely inferior to Solomon, who made a marvellous and befitting crown, similar to Solomon's.6 First a central ruby adorns the forehead. A shining jacinth follows. Third, a topaz is resplendent in the golden crown. A sapphire richly embellishes the fourth place. A sardonyx is fifth and rests above the royal ear, followed, sixth in order, by a chalcedony. Seventh is a jasper, from which the devil is driven far. Eighth, a red sard spews out flames. In the ninth place sits a radiant chrysolite. And you, beryl, illuminate the tenth. A green emerald fills the eleventh. And the twelfth, a chrysoprase, also adds to the vert. Above them all, at the apex, is placed a pearl which sets the lower gems ablaze. And on its right and left gleam two amethysts of matching hue. Just as, with clouds dispersed, the sky is aglow, studded with brilliant stars, so the golden crown, picked out with sparkling gems, glitters on every side with dazzling rays. 

Then there were two rods: 

> After the crown, the smith created a sceptre and rod, which alike portend the well-being of the realm. For by the sceptre uprisings in the kingdom are controlled and the rod gathers and confines those men that stray.

So the image of the king, jewel covered crown on his head, sitting in the chair holding two sceptres, is something William the Conqueror would absolutely recognise. That part of the coronation does stretch all the way back to William the Conqueror. The accounts of his coronation do not mention the orb or swords, but the Bayeux Tapestry shows [Harold Godwinson coronated](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-m&biw=808&bih=287&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=bayeux+tapestry+coronation&oq=bayeux+tapestry+cor&aqs=mobile-gws-lite.0.0l5#) holding an orb and being presented with one ordinary sword. But all the other paraphernalia would be alien to him. 

Then came the acclamation, markedly different in wording but roughly the same in meaning. Notably, because the general congregants spoke English and the nobility present spoke only French, it was given in both languages: 

> A Norman bishop then mounted the pulpit and spoke thus to the famous men of France. ""If the king now presented to you meets with
your approval, declare it to us, for this matter should be done according to your will."" The people allow it, and the clergy and witan approve,
showing by their hands what they could not express in words. The metropolitan follows with an identical speech in English. The congregation gives assent to both, hails the king and pledges service.

A major difference here is that the nature of the oaths and religious aspects of the ceremony were different, because William was a Catholic and modern UK monarchs are Protestant. We certainly did *not* see this bit in Charles' coronation: 

> The archbishop then turned towards the holy altar and set the king to face him. He summoned all the prelates to join him and, together with the king, they all prostrate themselves. The precentor, standing, starts the *Kyrie eleison* and also invokes the intercession of the saints. After the Litany of Saints, the bishops, together with the archbishop, stand up, leaving only the king lying prone. When the precentor ceased chanting, the whole congregation falls silent. The archbishop tells the people to pray and starts the office proper to the occasion.

Then came the annointing and, presumably, the crowning:

> [The archbishop] recites the Collect, raises the king from the dust, anoints the king's head with the chrism he pours out, and consecrates him king according to the royal rites.

At this point the song ends. However, it ends because at this point William's coronation went off the rails and there isn't much that makes him look good. According to a later source - Oderic Vitalis - the people inside the church were getting increasingly concerned about the crowd of people outside. Most of them were well-wishers and some were protesters, but nobody knew the proportions of that mix. They grew worried that the crowd outside was mostly hostile. After all, a chunk of the English population viewed him as an invader and an occupier, and from within the church they assumed the worst. Oderic even suggests that the ceremony was almost aborted, and that the king himself was shaking with nerves. Fearing that unrest would break out, the Norman troops moved in and through their heavy handed response assured that the coronation would devolve into violence around the church, which also happened to other medieval English rulers including Matilda and Richard the Lionheart. It wasn't a good medieval English coronation without a riot!"
AskHistorians,Did people actually worry about the occult during the Satanic Panic?,"I love this question because there is a literature on this, but the real answer is not very intuitive. The Satanic Panic was a nationwide phenomenon in the United States (as well as other English-speaking countries, which I won’t go into here) and was not divided by race or class. Although those who seriously believed in a growth in Satanic cults were generally devout Christians, the panic was not orchestrated by organized religion in general and belief in the claims being made did not require one to believe in real occult power. Rather, the most mainstream version was about the specter of secret psychological control and abuse, and was largely fueled by tabloid media and youth culture.

Allegations of Satanic ritual sex abuse in day cares were reported in depth by NBC, CBS, and ABC national news in the mid-1980s. They went into detail about the lurid and sometimes implausible details of these accusations, following the pattern of daytime television shows such as *Donahue*, *Geraldo*, and *Oprah*, all of which focused on vivid, sensational storytelling. *20/20* had an hour-long episode called “The Devil Worshipers,” and *Geraldo* aired a special on “Devil Worship: Exposing Satan’s Underground.” These programs were notably uncritical of extreme claims by alleged victims and prosecutors, and it fell on newspaper and magazine sources to push back — for instance, the conservative *National Review* called the allegations “absurd” and “straight out of a horror movie.”

Why did mainstream media take these claims seriously? Your question asks whether the public generally believed that Satanic cults had supernatural powers or were really interacting with infernal beings. While some devout Christians surely believed this, this was not a key part of the panic among the general population. Rather, the panic was led by the image of ordinary-looking people gathering in unsuspecting neighborhoods for evil deeds: that is, “cults.” 

The stereotype of the “dangerous cult” had emerged in the 1970s with battles between new religious movements and more traditional Christian opponents, but certainly came to the front of the popular imagination in 1978 with the self-destruction of Jim Jones’ People’s Temple. “Cults” were presented in the media as antisocial groups luring in unsuspecting ordinary people. Opponents of new religions were accepted by media sources as “cult experts,” although they themselves often practiced kidnapping and other forceful “deprogramming” tactics. Again, cults were generally assumed to be manipulative groups with no supernatural powers, but the pervasive imagery of the antisocial cult made the idea of a nationwide Satanic underground seem more plausible. Day cares were relatively new at the time and so attracted a similar suspicion to new religious movements.

These claims intersected with more devout Christian claims about a secret network of devil worshipers, which date back well before the mainstream panic, at the very least to 1972 if not earlier. /u/SSF415 has written about these claims [in a previous answer](/r/AskHistorians/comments/qu299w/what_social_historial_context_encouraged_the/), and you can see from that prior description that supernatural power was not a necessary part of the Christian claim either. There were some churches that did latch on to the idea that Satanists were really possessed by demons and needed divinely accredited exorcism, but going to such a church was not a prerequisite in this situation.

Besides the sad witch-hunts of day cares by prosecutors, the actual activity of the panic by non-devout parents was to prevent children from accessing things which might pollute their minds and lead them towards Satanism: rock or metal music, violent films, alternative religious material, *Dungeons & Dragons*, and so on. For the remainder of this answer I’d like to focus on the concrete example of *Dungeons & Dragons*, since it’s one aspect of youth culture from the Satanic Panic era which survives today and the moral panic against D&D was recently portrayed on *Stranger Things*.

As D&D became prominent on college campuses in the 1970s, older adults simply did not know what to make of this collective storytelling game because they had never heard of anything like it before. One newspaper report, published in a mainstream newspaper well before the Satanic Panic, shows how the new and perplexing hobby could induce anxiety in readers.

> On July 11, 1979, the *Los Angeles Times* published an article called simply “Dungeons and Dragons.” While the article was not intended as an attack on D&D, it described children losing interest in ordinary activities, suffering from depression after their characters die, and hoping for spells that would bring back the dead. It also had unusual sexual references, noting that monsters may spare characters with high charisma so that they can impose their romantic or sexual wills on them, and that one player’s character is a “slightly gay” cleric. Significantly, the article explains that “the player who is the dungeon master . . . functions as a cross between God and a psychologist, analyzing players’ characters’ abilities and giving each as much challenge as tolerable. . . . At his whim, the dungeon master can easily have players killed off or just as easily allow them to advance with little difficulty.” (Laycock, p.81)

You can see how parents might react to such a description. The fantasy worlds of adolescents seem to include death, violence and homosexuality. (Imagine how conservative parents might react even today if they learned that one of their kids was pretending to be a fictional transgender character from their favorite TV show.) Children get wrapped up in their fictional world, and the dungeon master is described as a kind of hypnotist able to manipulate the emotions of players. 

When James Dallas Egbert III, a closeted gay student who did not actually play D&D, went missing a month later in August 1979, his case was connected to D&D by a private investigator and became the subject of headlines like “Game Cultist Still Missing,” “‘Dungeons and Dragons’ Cult May Lead to Missing Boy,” and “Fantasy Turned Real Life May Have Killed Student.” (Laycock, p.84) The idea of a “cult” in these headlines was similar to the sense used today: Egbert was thought to be brainwashed by the fantasy and to be no longer able to distinguish the game from reality. As Laycock's book documents this psychological fear about D&D lasted into the mid-2000s. When I started playing D&D in 2006 my own mom, who is a secular Jew, was worried that I might ""get lost in the game"" somehow.

From these descriptions we can see that the dungeon master of a D&D game is not assumed to be an expert in occult powers (the co-creator of D&D Gary Gygax was himself a Christian!). Rather, there is a fear that participants in the game are meddling in psychological forces they cannot control, that this naturally produces a sort of ""cult"" atmosphere, and that the subconscious mind will take advantage of this in some terrifying way. As one [infamous Christian pamphlet against D&D explains](http://www.theescapist.com/archive-molitorletter.htm):

> it is known that the mind is very powerful and unexplainable. It is very possible for the sub-conscious mind to ""overpower"" the conscious mind. Suddenly you are no longer in total control of your mind. The ""fantasy game"" becomes a ""reality game"". You begin to live it for real. Everything you do, or say, involves or associates to the game itself. You no longer play the game for enjoyment, you play it because you feel you have to. You must have it (play it) just like a person on drugs, alcohol or tobacco must have them. It is an addiction. And your mind is under the control of the game. It is possessed by the game.

The kicker is that this same pamphlet describes D&D as occult and a Satanic trick, but there is no mention of the supernatural. The author quotes the Bible about the evil nature of the occult, but it seems to be implied that the Biblical authors knew that occult techniques didn't ""work"", and led only to delusion and loss of connection to God. Hence, his description of how D&D deludes us is a psychological one.

Was it common for CSA fanatics to claim northern whites were a different race than southern whites?","The pseudo science was informed by the belief that southerners were descended from the English of predominantly Norman stock, who had invaded England in 1066. Northerners were supposedly mostly descended from preexisting Anglo-Saxon stock, the vanquished of 1066.  

It falls apart because even though there were two separate societies as a result of the Conquest, with the ruling Norman-French elite not bothering the learn English for centuries, and even maintaining a dual language system which later led to the complexities of the English language, there was still intermarriage. For example William the Conqueror’s son Henry I had married Matilda of Scotland and it’s through here the Plantagenets could claim descent from Alfred the Great and other noteworthy Anglo-Saxon kings. Even the loser of Hastings, Harold II (Godwinson) managed to have his bloodline reintroduced into English aristocracy because during his short reign he managed to have a daughter Gytha married off to Vladimir II, Grand Prince of Kiev, whose progeny intermarried with Hungarian and then Spanish and Portuguese royalty to make its way back to England.  

These are just two notable examples. There were many others especially between the lower nobility and middling classes, not to mention the products of what occurs from momentary unions on the “wrong side of the sheets.”  

As German, Irish and Italian immigrants started pouring into the North, the Southerners embraced even the “Anglo-Saxon” moniker. There was no reason to differentiate between various Englishmen based on 1066 or Magna Carta signatories etc.

AskHistorians,Why are dalmatians associated with firefighting?,"So we do not have an exact reason for this but there are a couple of theories out there. I'll discuss the main theory and briefly touch on the second theory. In reality its probably a little bit of both.

The main theory comes from when the fire department transitioned from hand pump engines to steam powered engines in the mid 19th century. The hand pump engines used in the first half of the 19th century were not only manually pumped by the firefighters, but were also pulled by the firefighters themselves (atleast the majority of the time, im sure there were exceptions). The main theory for this is that horses would be spooked by the fire but we do not have an exact reason for this either, but that can be for a different time.

As buildings grew taller over time, firefighters were unable to reach the heights of these new buildings with their handpumps. The solution was the development  of the steam fire engine, which made sense given the technology that was available during that time. The firefighters first pulled these engines by hand as well, but this proved difficult given the size and weight of these engines. So firefighters now had to use horses in order to pull the heavy steam engines. Now the horses still had a fear of fire so they had to go through heavy training in order to overcome this fear. In addition to their training, the firefighters used coach dogs as a way to calm and help guide the horses. Dalmatians were a very common bread of coach dogs at the time already so they were used by the firefighters as well. 

The second theory is that Dalmatians frequently suffer from deafness at a higher rate than many other breeds so they weren't bothered by the bells and steam whistles that accompany firestations and engines.

And while not a real theory, there is a joke that the Dalmatians were used by the firefighters to find the fire hydrants lol.

AskHistorians,How did Europe solved housing after the second world war?,"I can't speak for the rest of Europe, but I can talk about the USSR. In short, they didn't, but it's not just the war fault, USSR had issues with housing even before the war, the whole of its history in fact, but they tried.

Actually somewhat of a solution came with Khruschev, but the first attempts were during Stalin's period. As an example, I'll use Ukraine, cause it suffered greatly during the war and I am familiar with its development.

Generally, as a result of the war Ukraine lost around 40 mln sqm(50% of its pre-war) housing, which resulted in 10 mln homeless people. The rebuilding process started during the war and would continue for decades. 
While that was happening people lived in damaged houses, overpopulated campuses, barracks, basements and dugouts(small dwelling half submerged in the ground). 

In 1944 a special database was created and local authorities as well as the Soviet government tried to provide housing. One of their first decisions was that a maximum norm for sqm per person was implemented and if your dwelling had more than the allotted amount government would house additional people with you. That was a common practice in USSR, communal housing was a solution that wen't through the 20s and 30s, and this was a more extreme version of that. 

While this bandaid was implemented a special committee started work on projects to begin mass housing development. By 1945 system was created with scores of special building organisations that consisted of architects, professional builders and engineers across the USSR. The first development plans were approved in 1945 and according to them Kyiv, Kharkiv, Stalino(Donetsk), Dnipropetrovsk(Dnipro) and Voroshilovgrad(Lugansk) will be first in line to start rebuilding. By spring 1945 a national committee of civil housing and a national committee of public affairs were created, they were to oversee these programs in future.

Apart from the government there also was a public initiative, some people created street and block committees to restore damaged housing. Additional funds were allotted to create educational facilities that would teach citizens the basics of building and restoration as well as new incentives to train more engineers and professional builders. Colgosp system was actively used in rural areas, they both provided tools and had their own building brigades.

All of this resulted in 21 mln sqm of housing being created by 1950, but the living situation was still dreadful, the bandaid solutions stayed for quite a while longer. Also, it's worth mentioning that because money was drained from other industries they didn't recover post-war and stayed stumped for decades, namely products of everyday use, household items, clothing and so on. (In the soviet system they just went by ""Product group B"")

The next major attempt, the one that actually made a dent in the housing issue, came with the death of Stalin. Mikita Khrushchov started the largest housing program of the Soviet Union - Khrushchevkas.

First, to explain what Khrushchevka is. By the 1950s soviet civil engineers concluded that to provide the population with enough housing they had to develop a new type of building, it had to be low-cost, easy to construct, could be built on mass and would be very minimal. The concept that was approved was Khrushchevka, or rather that is what they will call it later. So khrushchevka is a 3 to 5 story apartment complex made out of concrete-steel panels, its apartments have 2 bedrooms(or a living room and a bedroom, 2 rooms in total), around 35 sqm, with no lift and no garbage chute. 

To provide construction with enough material additional steel-concrete factories were built all over USSR, in Kiyv alone 5 of them appeared. Generally concrete production in USSR skyrocketed during this period. From 1950 to 1958 the amount of money given to civil housing increased by 350%.

As a result of those measures in 1956-63 as much housing was built as in 40 years before and Ukraine in 1958 doubled its 1950 stats on built houses per capita. All in all, just in 1958-60 Ukraine, the development peak, 43.2 mln sqm of housing was built and 4.2 mln people got a home. Even by 2000s khrushchevkas accounted for around 20%(71.2 mln sqm) of apartment complexes in Ukraine.

All of that sounds great, but unfortunately, it didn't solve the issue, housing will stay as one of the key problems of the USSR, in large part just due to people moving to cities, population growth, earlier and later policies, the government simply could not outrun the scarcity. 

Another trouble with khrushchevkas, that will become evident later, they weren't particularly good quality, as often is with mass development, now, 65 years later they desperately need restoration, insulation upgrades, concrete panels aren't great for that and some are being demolished due to being too dangerous, in fact, one of the first blocks, which was used as the ""poster boy"" for the project, they even made ridiculous a [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjC1hm9Rh-s) about it, Cheremushki in Moscow, is no more.

So that's USSR housing after the war, naturally, there is a lot more to it but that is the gist.

AskHistorians,What civilisation was considered ancient to the ancient Egyptians?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"Why is the number ""4"" so prevalent in Chinese history, despite the strong tetraphobia in Chinese society?","I will try to address this question considering “number culture” occupies a very important position in the world view of ancient Chinese. Divination rituals involving prepared bundles of yarrow stalks have persisted since the Zhou Dynasty. As recorded in the classic text *[I Chin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching)* (“Book of Changes”),  the ancients would take a handful of yarrow and count the number to see if it was an odd or even number, as means to predict good and bad luck. 【1】


In fact, the same number is given different ""bad"" or ""lucky"" superstitions in different situations. ""Four"" is considered an auspicious number in many contexts within Chinese folk traditions. In traditional wedding ceremonies, ""four"" is often regarded as a lucky number. In many local wedding customs, there must be ""four kinds"" of offerings consisting of red dates, red sorghum, red candles, and red silk fabric placed on the wedding table. The bride also would wear “four reds"" consisting of a red shirt, red pants, a pair of red shoes, and red socks for the occasion, symbolizing “four happiness (四红四喜)” of marriage (having plenty of food, clothing, prosperity, and posterity).【2】


Similarly, during Spring Festival celebrations, which is the most important traditional Chinese holiday, the number ""four"" also bears auspicious meanings. The fourth day of the Lunar New Year is also known as Sheep Day based on [Nuwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCwa)'s creation myth. It is the day when people welcome the auspicious household gods back into their home and pray for a bountiful year. Specifically, on the fourth day of Lunar New Year, people would welcome the Stove God (灶神) and the God of Wealth (财神) back to their homes and businesses【3】.


In addition, the dining table tradition in some parts of China also regards ""four"" as an auspicious number. For example, in many southern inland regions, ""four"" is considered to represent ""four seasons of prosperity"" and ""four seasons of peace"" during banquets, where guests follow “third cup toast to the broad road ahead, fourth cup toast to four seasons of prosperity (三杯通大道，四杯四季发) drinking ritual.” 【4】


In contemporary China, especially after market liberalization in the post-1970s, China's economic life has undergone tremendous changes, and businesses have adopted homonym based number culture in customer facing areas. Due to the homonym factor, the traditionally ordinary number  “eight” has become more and more popular because it has similar pronunciation as the word “發” (fortune) in Cantonese. And “four” being homonymous with the word “dead” in many Chinese dialects (especially in coastal Min Nan speaking regions), convinced many businesses to eschew from displaying it in their customer facing areas. Thus in contemporary China, you see the taboo of ""four"" most pronounced in the healthcare, hospitality, and transportation related sectors. For instance, since 2002, Xiamen City government would no longer issue vehicle license plates with the number ""four"" in order to meet the sensibility of their predominantly  Min Nan speaking locals. Similarly, in Japan, ""4"" and ""9"" are often taboo in business settings, because their pronunciation in Japanese is homonymous with ""death"" and ""bitterness"". 【5】

AskHistorians,"""Beef-eating Latins""--so an eyewitness to the 1204 sack of Constantinople calls Western Christians. Did the Byzantines not eat beef?","My reading of the passage is a little different from yours. The author does not express disdain for people who consume beef. Beef was and is very expensive to produce, requiring a lot of land, time, and labor compared to most other sources of animal protein - so typically you see it as an elite food.

Niketas points out how the masses believe the invading force to be on their side, because they plunge the wealthy elite of Constantinople into poverty - when in reality the Latin invaders are:

A) uncouth people drinking undiluted wine with very little in common with Greeks

B) rich foreigners who are just as much an elite as the people they kicked down. They eat expensive meat and drink wine at excess (i.e. without water). So they aren't even classy about their elite status.

The ""peasants and common riff-raff"" will figure that out sooner rather than later and realize that their new masters are just as bad as the old ones (if not worse).


----

With that in mind I think Food History is one of the more dynamic and intriguing fields of the discipline as it intersects with so many other aspects of human culture and has continuities into the present day. 

A worthwhile introduction is: Paul Freedman (ed.) *Food, the History of Taste*, London, Thames & Hudson, 2007 and 2019.

Freedman is a medieval historian himself, who would probably have a lot to say about 1204. The volume contains a good chapter on the cuisine among the Latin aristocracy with C.M. Woolgar, ""Feasting and Fasting, Food  and Taste in Europe in the Middle Ages"" (pp 146-173), as well as an idea on the Byzantine tastes with  Veronika Grimm, ""The Good Things that Lay at Hand, Tastes of Ancient Greece and Rome"" (pp 62-92)."
AskHistorians,Was bullying among children at school in the mid-century United States as bad as depicted in popular culture?,"I answered a similar question on this topic through the lens of books by Stephen King and George R.R. Martin so I'm going to pull a bit from that. 

King was born in 1947 and Martin was 1948, which would mean they both hit high school in the early 1960s.  Let's assume they're both incorporating aspects of their own school experiences. Pre-World War II, attending high school was normal and getting a high school diploma was common but it wasn't necessarily the norm across the country. What this meant, functionally speaking, is that if a young person or their family family felt high school wasn't a good fit, they would simply stop going. Some communities would exert social pressure but it was highly contextual, especially based on the young person's future careers. (The oldest son from a wealthy Boston family whose father went to Harvard? He's graduating. The youngest son from a middle class family in Detroit whose father, uncles, and aunts work at a car factory? He may not and it would be okay.) Conversely, it also meant that a school could ask a young person to stop attending high school if the administrators at the school felt they weren't a good fit. While most states had some degree of compulsory education by the early 1900s, they were often dead letter laws and not enforced in the way the are today. By the 1960s, the dynamics had changed; finishing high school became the norm across the country. An interesting marker for the shift in American society is the popularity of the concept of a ""high school drop out."" While it was used before the 1960s, it wasn't until that it reached common usage with the implication it has today. Their ages also make them members of the Baby Boom generation, which among other things, led to a massive boom in school construction and in places where schools couldn't be built fast enough, overcrowded classrooms. (More on the history of school construction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ex6j82/what_caused_the_drastic_change_in_the_design_of/) if you're so inclined.) I have to defer to our friends at /r/AskSocialScience as to why children bully each other as it is also outside the scope of our subreddit but it stands to reason that larger student bodies and increased participation by young people who may have otherwise left high school meant an increase in the likelihood of unpleasant experiences between young people. 

Which leads us to artistic license. This, to be sure, isn't to minimize anyone's experiences being bullied which is a sucky, sucky thing. Rather, it's to acknowledge that how creatives talk about what happens in school is often dramatized for effect. There is no universal school experience, much less a generic American school experience or student experience. [In this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/eyvgxe/movies_like_lean_on_me_and_the_substitute_make/), I get into how urban high schools were portrayed in 1980s movies and some of the misleading messages in those movies.

All of that said, bullying - or the act of someone with access to power (due to being older, being physically larger, having more social capital, etc.) targeting someone with less power in order to making an experience or setting uncomfortable for others - wasn't invented by Baby Boomers. In [this answer](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ei2lv6/in_farmer_boy_by_laura_ingalls_wilder_a_frontier/) about a section of a Laura Ingalls Wilder 1933 novel *Farmer Boy*, I get into some of the dynamics around school discipline. Wilder describes the boys as bullying younger children as well as the teacher. More to the point, bullying isn't uniquely a school experience. Some of the texts that talked about the history of bullying that I looked at while writing this response took pains to point that out - bullying happens in families, workplaces, prisons, etc., though we often have different language for describing what's happening in those situations. What's unique around bullying in schools is that it's associated with children, which carries with it a whole bunch of tensions around how children are viewed and treated in a particular society; be that as innocents who don't know better, mirrors of the adults who raise them, or even wild and uncontrollable. It's also not a uniquely American phenomenon - ""bullying studies"" emerged as an international field in the 1990s but began in the 1970s and 80s in different countries around the world."
AskHistorians,"Why did Tolkien rebel against the Shakespearean concept of elves by depicting them as tall, slender and wise instead of small and silly?","The conception of elves in the popular imagination underwent a significant evolution from the medieval period to the Victorian era - an evolution that Tolkien was not a fan of. In his seminal 20th century fantasy works, J.R.R. Tolkien consciously rebelled against the twee, diminutive elf trope that had developed over centuries of literature and folklore. Instead, he revived the ancient mystique of elves as towering, wise beings aligned with nature.

The exact origins of ""elves"" are nigh impossible to pin down, but we know of numerous elve-like creatures throughout history of which Tolkien was aware and inspired by. For example, in Norse mythology, elves originated as vaguely supernatural creatures associated with light and darkness. Though these were then recast by medieval Christians as more spiritual, ethereal, beings (possibly to preserve these elements of pagan folklore). However, by the Elizabethan period, writers arguably began conflating elves from Germanic mythology with diminutive fairies (or “faeries”) from Celtic traditions. William Shakespeare epitomized this change in “A Midsummer Night's Dream”, portraying elves and fairies as diminutive, whimsical pranksters.

Victorian authors further diminished and sentimentalized elves, associating them with children’s stories and idealized fantasies of delicate fairies suited to pastoral settings (*I'd recommend Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness by Carole G. Silver*). Andrew Lang’s fairy books embodied this notion for Victorian children like the young J.R.R. Tolkien, who later lamented the lack of primal mythic resonance in such twee Victorian elves.[1]

As an adult, Tolkien penned an influential essay “On Fairy-Stories” (1947) arguing that the modern concept of elves had become untethered from the mystical, mysterious roots evident in Norse and medieval folklore. In his Middle Earth legendarium, he consciously elevated elves back to beings of ancient dignity and artistic genius while rejecting what he saw as the twee Victorian elf trope. 

Moreover, Tolkien’s commitment to recapturing the archaic origins of elves aligned with early 20th century scholarly interest in myth and folklore, as seen in works like Sir James Frazer’s The Golden Bough (1890). However, it's worth pointing out that Tolkien resisted aligning his elves with just one specific tradition, and he denied direct inspiration from Celtic legends in reference to nomenclature in particular.[2] In response to comments from a reader at his publishing firm for “Quenta Silmarillion”, Tolkien wrote:

> Needless to say they [the names] are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason.

Beyond broadly rebelling against the prevailing Victorian elf archetype, Tolkien imbued his elves with very particular physical, cultural, and psychological attributes according to his personal vision. Tolkien saw his elves as inherently tied to nature, living in harmony with the woods and speaking with trees. However, he also endowed them with a deep melancholic sadness, a sense that their time in Middle Earth was fading as the Age of Men approached.[3] He wrote the Elves as immortal beings who could be slain in battle but did not suffer natural death from old age or sickness.

According to Tolkien's letters, these specific characteristics derived from his desire to create a mythology that evoked both the natural world and human scope for both joy and sorrow, hope and regret.[4] The Elves served as an intermediary between man and nature, imbued with human emotions and artistic gifts but bound to the natural world in a way mortal Men were not.

AskHistorians,Were the technological differences between ancient (like the Olmecs) and more modern (like the Aztecs and the Maya) Mesoamerican civilizations as large as the ones between ancient and medieval Europeans?,"Something to keep in mind when discussing the deep history of Mesoamerica is the different time scale of human habitation between the Americas and Afro-Eurasia. Specifically the fact that, while humans spent tens of thousands of years pulsing out of Africa, it was not until maybe twenty thousand years ago that humans began trickling into the Americas. The peoples that did not make the trek across Beringia therefore had a significantly longer time to domesticate plants and animals, and to expand their populations and settlements.

Defining ""civilization"" is always an arbitrary and contentious process, but generally agreed upon criteria usually involve some mix of sedentism, agriculture, and urbanism. In Afro-Eurasia, these elements start to coalesce around 9 to 10 thousand years ago in Mesopotamia. Relatively large and semi-sedentary populations are evidenced by sites like Göbekli Tepe, which occurs right at the cusp of wheat domestication, and larger settlements like Catalhöyük follow a few thousand years later. By about 6000 years ago, organized, agriculture-based, urban states started to arise in Sumeria, and the rest is history.

In comparison, the unequivocal evidence for human habitation in Mesoamerica is dated to about 10 to 12  thousand years ago (Stinnesbeck et al. 2017), though there are some much older claims (Ardelean et al. 2020). In archaeological terms then, people were just starting to settle Mesoamerica at the same time Mesopotamians were building proto-cities. Evidence for the beginning of maize dates back to about 5000 years ago (Benz 2001), about the same time as large state formation in Mesoamerica. By the time of the earliest Mesoamerican cities around 3000 years ago, multiple empires had risen and fallen in Mesopotamia.

The parallel rise of stratified, agricultural, urban societies in Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica is, to me, one of the most wonderful parts about studying the latter region. That groups of people separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years would come up with so many similar societal structures is a fascinating aspect of what is essentially a grand human experiment. 

The point of this extended prologue is not to denigrate the ""New World"" or laud the ""Old World"" (terms I despise), but to set the frame for understanding what it means to talk about ""ancient"" Mesoamerica. The groups of people which comprised that era of history were literally inventing human civilization from scratch, without a template to work from or an outside group from which to borrow (though some diffusion did occur from South America later). They were also doing so on an incredibly compressed timescale, without the benefit of tens of thousands of years of accumulated human knowledge about the plants, animals, and minerals in their environment.

The situation of building human civilization from the ground up means there are some unusual changes from the oldest Olmec sites and the cultures Europeans encountered some 2000 years later. Turkeys, for instance, are seen as one of the staples of the Mesoamerican diet, but widespread and consistent use of domesticated turkeys does not really show up in the region until the Postclassic (after 900 CE). Before then, sparse evidence exists for turkey domestication and use, and what exists is hard to differentiate between exploitation of wild turkeys (Thornton & Emery 2014).

Likewise with maize, the premier staple crop of the Americas, the earliest settlements in Mesoamerica show a markedly different pattern than what arose later. Although domestication of teosinte does occur thousands of years prior to the Olmec polity of San Lorenzo, it was not until around 1000 BCE that maize agriculture became the dominant agricultural product of Mesoamerica (Rosenswig et al 2015). 

Around this time period a confluence of both genetic and cultural changes may have served to put maize in its preeminent position. Selection for larger cob size and ease of harvestability coincided with favorable growing conditions. The increased production of maize increased it's political and religious significance, which encouraged elites to tie themselves to control of the crop and encourage its spread. At the same time, both the selection of maize and the spread of ceramics made growing the crop more sustainable away from its traditional heartlands, which included the Coatzacoalcos floodplains of San Lorenzo. Increased viability of ""upland"" polities, like La Venta, may have contributed to the decline of San Lorenzo (Arnold 2009). 

The way maize was being used was also changing around this time. Before 1000 BCE, the idea goes, maize was mainly used for its sugar content, with ""sugar stalk"" maize being crushed for its sugary juice to be used as a sweetener or fermented into alcoholic beverages (Smalley & Blake 2003). Around 1000 BCE, the confluence of factors mentioned above led to a shift towards consuming maize directly or ground into flour. The genetic history of maize points to another significant change around a thousand years ago, which may have been significant for the starch production to make tortillas (Jaenicke-Despres et al 2003).

One significant innovation -- albeit one confined to a single region -- dating perhaps to the Late Classic but rising to prominence in the Postclassic era (after 900 CE) was the chinampa (Rosales-Torres et al. 2022). Often called “floating gardens,” these were actually a form of raised bed agriculture. The Valley of Mexico, home of Tenochtitlan which is now called Mexico City, was formerly the site of an extensive lake system. Lake Texcoco, as it was called, was more like a series of seasonally interconnected lakes, the freshest and most productive of which were located in the southern part of the Valley, Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco.  
As population in the Valley of Mexico rebounded from the Classic era consolidation at Teotihuacan, the southern lakes became vital centers for agricultural production. Swampy lakeshores were mucked to create canals, and the fertile earth consolidated into long rectangular plots, which could then be periodically fertilized with more lake mud, night soil, or even specifically prepared soils (Frederick 2007). The transformation of large swathes of land previous unsuited for agriculture into richly arable soil massively increased the productivity of the region and represented -- if taken as a single project -- the largest single expenditure of human power in Mesoamerica (Arco & Abrams 2006). 

Chinampas spread from the southern region to the rest of the lake system. Famously, under the Aztecs, a dike was built to separate the more brackish waters of eastern Lake Texcoco from the fresher waters around Tenochtitlan in the west, creating a more amenable environment for chinampa agriculture for that city. The expansion of chinampa agriculture was part of a suite of hydrological management that fueled the Aztecs, but were sadly not sustained under the Spanish (Conway 2018). 

Another classic symbol of Mesoamerica, pyramids, was likewise absent from the earliest settlements. San Lorenzo contains no pyramid. The monumental architecture of that site consists of large earthen mounds and, of course, its famous stone heads and altars. The oldest pyramid in Mesoamerica is found at La Venta, with other pyramids cropping up at Preclassic Maya sites (such as El Mirador). All of these post-date the earliest urban sites in Mesoamerica but centuries.

La Venta’s pyramid is little more than an earthen mound (though it has never been excavated). Later pyramids do start to feature stone cladding of increasing complexity, though the Mesoamerican pattern of building new phases of pyramids over the older site can complicate analysis. Teotihuacan in the Classic era, however, can be illustrative of the ways larger pyramids were built in later times. 

The major pyramids at Teotihuacan (Sun, Moon, Feathered Serpent) appear to have been constructed using “cells” with walls of wood posts, stone blocks, or adobe bricks, which were then infilled using earth and crushed stone. Facing stones could then be cemented in using prepared clay, and then the whole structure covered in a lime plaster (Murakami 2015). This is a significant systemic improvement from the piled earth of the early Olmecs. 

The Teotihuacanos also pioneered a style of pyramid construction called “talud-tablero,” which ended up being adopted throughout Mesoamerica. In this style, construction layers alternate between a slanted or vertical “talud” topped by a heavy slab “tablero.” While not necessarily a paradigm shift in pyramid construction (non-tablud-tablero pyramids were still constructed), it was a powerfully influential style, with the tablero section acting as a canvas for carvings or murals. The Temple of Niches in El Tajin is an example of how elaborate this style could get."
AskHistorians,"Monte Testaccio in Rome is a man-made hill consisting of over 50 million discarded wine amphorae. As far as I know, ""Roman Fever"" was actually Malaria. Was Monte Testaccio a major breeding spot for mosquito-borne diseases in Ancient Rome?","**Summary:** In antiquity Monte Testaccio was a carefully controlled industrial site, not a dumping ground for organic waste. It did have a reputation for malaria *in the modern era* prior to Rome's 20th century modernisation, but so did lots of other places that are low-lying, near bodies of water, and with greenery. Its location is probably the main factor in its reputation in the modern era, but I suggest that it's at least *possible* that its composition is also a contributing factor, because degraded ceramics have the potential to act an excellent fertiliser trap.

Robert Sallares' *Malaria and Rome. A history of malaria in ancient Italy* (Oxford, 2002) has extensive discussion of the prevalence of malaria, and regions affected by malaria both in antiquity and in historical modern reports. Ancient observers considered Rome to be much healthier than its surroundings because of its hills, as in Livy [5.54.4](https://archive.org/details/livy-in-fourteen-volumes.-vol.-3-loeb-172/page/182/mode/2up):

> It was for good reason that gods and mortals chose this place for founding a city: the **exceptionally healthy hills**, the convenient river on which to transport crops from inland regions ...

To some extent they were probably right, because mosquitoes breed on low ground. The above passage comes in the context of an account of the Gauls' siege of Rome, ca. 386 BCE, in which the Gaulish camp was afflicted by disease (Livy [5.48.1-2](https://archive.org/details/livy-in-fourteen-volumes.-vol.-3-loeb-172/page/160/mode/2up)):

> The Gauls also suffered from a disease outbreak, not just because they had their camp **in a low-lying place between hills**, but also because it was heated by the fires and full of mist, and whenever there was a breath of wind it was full of ash, not just dust.

No symptoms are described, but Sallares infers that the Gaulish camp was hit by malaria (p. 201).

He takes the sharp divides between healthy and unhealthy spots as something typical of Rome's history, since similar sharp divides are reported in the modern era (he provides many examples). Other ancient observers were aware of the propensity for fevers in certain parts of Rome, such as the forum. Juvenal, *Satires* 4.56-57, mentions people *hoping to get* a quartan fever (that is, a four-day dose of malaria) --

> Now death-bearing autumn was giving way to frosts,  
now sick people were hoping for a quartan [*quartanam*] ...

He explains this by observing that different strains of malaria interfere with one another and act as a preventative: so a quartan caused by *P. vivax* reduces the risk of a fever caused by *P. falciparum* or *P. vivax* (Sallares, p. 218). He adduces another ancient report of a plague in 174 BCE whose survivors had quartan fevers -- that is, they contracted a less serious illness that interfered with a lethal strain.

{**Edit:** *thanks to /u/De_dato for the correction to this paragraph ([see below](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/10rloko/monte_testaccio_in_rome_is_a_manmade_hill/j6zksl8/)). I misconstrued what Sallares wrote: the error is mine, not his.*}

Sallares also cites a number of reports ranging from 16th century anecdotes to 19th century epidemiological studies -- pre-modernisation, that is -- to illustrate Rome's reputation for 'bad air' in that period. (Hence the name: *mal'aria*, 'bad air'.) In the 19th century studies, it's low-lying areas and areas next to the river that are particularly highlighted as unhealthy.

Monte Testaccio is indeed one of the spots mentioned. First, at page 206:

> Some districts [of Rome] were quite safe, while others were dangerous in the summer and autumn. Baccelli provided interesting information in a very useful but propagandistic article about malaria in the city of Rome, which was published by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1878 ... Baccelli still had extensive information available about the situation before the modernization of Rome commenced:

>> We find that on the right bank of the Tiber the centre of the Leonine city can be said to be immune to fevers; on the other hand more or less unhealthy are the side streets, Porta Angelica, the Vatican hill; the Janiculum and the entire area from the Janiculum to Porta Portese is unhealthy. On the left bank of the Tiber the unhealthiness of **the vicinity of Monte Testaccio**, of Porta and Via Ostiense and of Porta San Sebastiano is well known; ...

And p. 213:

> Celli also drew attention to a map of malaria in Rome in 1884 produced by two doctors, Lanzi and Torrigiani, who listed 'even the quarters of Trastevere, Pincio, Viminale, Esquilin, Celio, **Testaccio**, Palatine' as malarious.

However, there's more to this than just the hill itself. Monte Testaccio is

1. a sudden prominence in a low-lying area -- the surrounding terrain is ca. 10-14 metres above sea level -- and

2. about 200 metres from the bank of the Tiber.

For comparison, Sallares mentions an anecdote of Pope Urban VIII fleeing from the Vatican to the Quirinal hill to avoid a malaria outbreak in 1623. This was very likely effective: Urban was moving to a location more than 2 km from the river, and 50+ metres above sea level.

Having said that, Sallares seems to be at least interested in the idea that Monte Testaccio's reputation for malaria is at least partly related to its composition. He reproduces a photo of the hill with the following non-committal description:

> The vicinity of Monte Testaccio was one district of the city of Rome that was dangerous with regard to malaria in the past. The hill is about 45 metres above sea level and is composed entirely of broken pots, which had been thrown away from the port facilities of ancient Rome on the River Tiber nearby. It is now overgrown with vegetation.

He doesn't suggest a specific link between its reputation and its composition, but it's clear that he's thinking about it.

I'd suggest that if we're looking at its composition as a factor, then we shouldn't be thinking about the *contents* of the pots, but rather about *the pots themselves*. Degraded ceramics absorb a range of salts, and are exceptionally good at preventing nutrients from leaching into the environment. Ceramics are a terrific way to give material stability to fertiliser granules (Nascimento et al. 2019, 'The effect of different ceramic materials to improve hardness of organomineral fertilizer granules', *IJACT* [17.1: 153-161](https://doi.org/10.1111/ijac.13226)). As a result, I suggest that the entire hill could be regarded as a fertiliser trap -- and hence a potential breeding ground.

Now, that's conjectural, and the hill could probably do with a dedicated study by experienced soil scientists (if it hasn't had one; I haven't found any). And it doesn't necessarily imply that the hill was a breeding ground for mosquitoes *in antiquity*. In antiquity it was a carefully constructed industrial site, not a random heap of organic deposits. I'm only suggesting that the high levels of ceramics in the soil could be a contributing factor to its 19th century reputation.

For malaria, geography and proximity of water isn't the sole factor: greenery matters too. Sallares notes that the old Jewish Ghetto in Rome suffered almost no malaria, in spite of the fact that it's low-lying and a stone's throw from the Tiber. He suggests that this was because it is so densely built, with no greenery or gardens, and it was walled until 1848 (p. 210). He notes that in antiquity, Rome had many more standing ponds than it did by the modern era. In the 1st century CE, Pliny was well aware of the propensity of damp green spaces to attract mosquitoes (*Natural history* [19.180](https://archive.org/details/L371PlinyNaturalHistoryV1719/page/n545/mode/2up)) --

> And *culices* infest damp gardens, especially if there are any shrubs. These can be dispersed by burning galbanum resin.

(That is, the resin of *Ferula galbaniflua*, a Syrian giant fennel; it's still used in some cosmetics and fragrances.)

**Edit:** *I belatedly saw a response to a removed comment pointing out that the question was always about the pots rather than their contents. I apologise: I too misconstrued the question as being about organic residue rather than the pots themselves. On the question of whether stacked potsherds would make a good environment for breeding mosquitoes, I suggest /r/askscience is more likely to have someone equipped to give an answer to that.*"
AskHistorians,Why weren’t there diseases in the “new world” that would have effected colonisers similarly to how native Americans were wiped out by western diseases?,This is a very common question and is kind of a myth. I can link [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3ck97r/comment/cswt3wd/)  [wonderful](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/40myca/comment/cyvz8gv/)  [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3jll9c/comment/cuqoepv/?context=999) in the faq from u/anthropology_nerd (and the excellent u/400-Rabbits makes an appearance as well in some of these).
AskHistorians,"I am Peter Samsonov, author of IS-2: Development, Design, and Production of Stalin's Warhammer. AMA about Soviet heavy tanks!","Internet tank games frequently focus on the utility of tanks against other tanks, but the IS-2's design seems particularly informed by anti-infantry and anti-fortification considerations with the selection of the 122mm gun.

&#x200B;

How did the Soviets break down the various uses of the tank's main gun into roles, and how did the different guns considered compare, were there any targets like fortifications that the 122mm gun was effective against but the smaller guns simply weren't, or was it selected simply on the basis of being better at tasks all the guns could accomplish?"
AskHistorians,What’s the context behind this ancient Roman tombstone for a 4yo child who died in the mines?,"So what we have here is a funerary monument (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 2.3258, in case anyone wants to look it up) found near Jaén, Spain with a picture of a child holding a basket and hammer, and an inscription that begins:

>QARTULUS / ANORVIIII

The rest of the inscription is partially cut off but appears to have said *sit tibi terra levis*, a common formula of funerary monuments meaning ""may the earth be light on you"". The age of the child has actually been disputed. Whatever precedes the number is an abbreviated form of the word *annorum* ""of years"", but it could either be *annoru(m) IIII* ""of 4 years"" or *annor(um) VIIII* ""of 9 years"". People have argued both ways about it.

Regardless, Quartulus (or possibly Quintus Artulus) is definitely a child, and regardless of his age, the answer to both of your questions is a definite yes.

Yes, children worked in the mines in the Ancient Roman world, even though the working conditions were horrible and rough. Several sources from around the ancient Mediterranean mention this. For example Agatharchides of Cnidus, a 2nd-century BCE historian whose work survives in summaries and quotations from later writers, describes the gold mining process in North Africa and Arabia in detail; he says that not-yet-adult boys go into the mine shafts and bring stones out into the open, then men break the stones apart and women grind them in a mill. So—similarly to more recent child labor practices—children had a distinctive role in the mines because they were able to fit into small spaces.

It seems that when children worked in the mines it was often because their fathers did; adult male miners sometimes had wives and children working alongside them, migrating to and/or living in workers' camps with them. Mine laborers of all ages were sometimes enslaved, sometimes hired. A workers' contract from a Dacian gold mine in 164 CE actually specifies different wage rates for adults and children! (Adults made 70 denarii, children made only 10.) Several inscriptions, not just this one, commemorate children and adolescents who worked in Iberian mines.

To your other question, yes it was fairly common for Roman funerary monuments to depict the deceased at work or with objects related to their occupation. It was *more* common to just show the person standing or reclining elegantly or with their family or something else, or not to have a relief of the deceased person at all, but Roman funerary monuments vary a lot. They could be used to highlight many different aspects of a person's identity, including their profession. As the example of little Quartulus shows, this was not limited to high-status professions, but freedmen in particular liked depicting their professions on their funerary monuments as a way of showing off their upward mobility. As some random (and accessible online) examples, [this man](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1920-0220-1) was a grain merchant or a baker, and depicted corn measures on his gravestone; [these men](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1954-1214-1) depicted their metalworking and carpentry tools next to the reliefs of their own faces; [this relief](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/468268) (on a sarcophagus, not a stele) shows a deceased doctor with his surgical tools.

AskHistorians,"Vermont was the first state to ban slavery, having done so when it was an independent country in 1777. To what extent did slavery exist in the area that is now Vermont prior to 1777?","This question really sent me down a rabbit hole, OP. I hope you don’t mind me adding some further thoughts on top of what u/deadowl mentioned and sharing some of the problems I ran into trying to answer a deceptively simple question: what share of the Vermont population in 1777 was held in slavery? 

Perhaps your question was posed in response to some of the same challenges that I ran into looking into existing sources. 

I would like to discuss the (1) problem with the sources I found; (2) the relevance of finding exact figures; and (3) a list of potential resources for further research. 

There are two censuses that we can draw on to examine the composition of Vermont’s population in 1777. The province of New York conducted a census in 1771, which took into account counties and towns that would go on to make up the Vermont Republic in 1777. This appears to be the only colonial census of New York that includes Vermont. The other is the first U.S. federal census of 1790. Numbers in these two sources are helpful but there are a few problems.   

To set the lay of the land, the population of Vermont appears to be around 10,000 in 1771. This figure grew to 85,341 by 1790. 

The 1771 census was taken at a time when New York’s Albany County extended into land that would be partitioned to form parts of Vermont (alongside the counties of Gloucester and Cumberland that would be wholly incorporated into Vermont). This is the closest data on the population of Vermont that we have to the founding of the Vermont Republic in 1777. Although  New Hampshire claimed territories of Vermont at different moments, I am not aware of any census data from New Hampshire from this period that covers the territories of what would become Vermont.

The problem with the 1771 census is that the data as relayed in a 1849 “The Documentary History of State of New York,” edited by NY Secretary of State Christopher Morgan ([https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924055329670&view=1up&seq=739&skin=2021](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924055329670&view=1up&seq=739&skin=2021)) recorded the Black population in these counties but does not mark how many were held in bondage. 

A screen capture of the 1771 census page from the town of Dummerston, Vermont (then part of Cumberland County) that was made available by American Ancestors ([https://www.americanancestors.org/search/databasesearch/2741/vermont-windham-and-windsor-county-census-1771](https://www.americanancestors.org/search/databasesearch/2741/vermont-windham-and-windsor-county-census-1771)) does not even have a column for Black residents. (To be fair, the 1771 census only recorded a total of 19 Black people in all of Cumberland and Gloucester counties.)

Here, I want to flag that a lot of discussions on pre-independence U.S. population treat Cumberland and Gloucester counties as “Vermont” - sometimes with a tiny footnote that this is not all of Vermont. (See Colonial and Pre-Federal Statistics Appendix pg. 1171: [https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist\_stats\_colonial-1970/hist\_stats\_colonial-1970p2-chZ.pdf](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1970/hist_stats_colonial-1970p2-chZ.pdf))

The problem stems from parts of Albany county that became part of Vermont. This is where the 1790 U.S. federal census found all of the remaining slave population of the recently-admitted state ([https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1790/number\_of\_persons/1790a-02.pdf](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1790/number_of_persons/1790a-02.pdf) - the numbers themselves also come from 1791 as Vermont was not admitted until then). But the records from the 1771 census in the 1849 volume neither distinguishes between free and enslaved Black people or how many of these people lived in parts of Albany county that would form the self-declared Vermont Republic in 1777.

So, all 16 slaves identified in the 1790 census were recorded in Vermont’s Bennington County (formerly part of Albany county). 

While this appears to contradict the 1777 constitution, its text allows for continued enslavement of people if they are younger than 21 (for men) or 18 (for women). Additionally, people may be bound by law “for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.”

This means that it is possible that the 16 slaves left in Bennington county were men who were younger than 8 or women who were younger than 5 in 1777. But this assumes proper enforcement of the statute. 

We know this was not the case, per research by Harvey Amani Whitfield. (Excerpt from his book here: [https://www.flowofhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Problem-of-Slavery-in-Early-Vermont%E2%80%94excerpt.pdf](https://www.flowofhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Problem-of-Slavery-in-Early-Vermont%E2%80%94excerpt.pdf)) 

He notes that:

“\[In 1835,\] Lucy Caroline Hitchcock migrated back to Burlington from Alabama along with two slaves, 35-year-old Lavinia Parker and her 12-year-old son Francis. For at least six years, she owned these people as slaves in Vermont before manumitting them after Lavinia’s husband had paid her a sum of money.”

Moreover, there was a practice of Vermonters taking minors who were still held as slaves per the 1777 constitution and selling them in New York or Canada. This was apparently common enough that the state passed a law in 1806 that explicitly prohibited the trafficking of slaves in the state, noting that “there have been a number of instances of Negro persons, who were minors, having been transported by evil minded persons from this to the other States and \[the\] province of Canada, where slavery is established by law, and there disposed of as slaves.”

I wanted to also note that the Wikipedia page highlights a passage that suggests that the enslavement of the 16 people in Bennington might have been recorded in error:

“The careless clerk or copyist who did the work transferred the footing of the column of ""free colored"" persons to the foot of the adjoining column of ‘slaves.’”

However, this seems unconvincing because the 1790 census ([https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1790/number\_of\_persons/1790a-02.pdf](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1790/number_of_persons/1790a-02.pdf)) for Bennington county has a column for “all other free people” and “slaves” - and there are towns in the county where there are free people and slaves. 

So we don’t know how many enslaved people there were in Vermont in 1777 because we don’t know how many Black people in the Gloucester and Cumberland counties in 1771 were held against their will (if any) - and I have not examined the 1771 census closely enough to identify what populations covered under Albany county should be counted as Vermont. 

At this point, one could question the relevance of these numbers. Clearly the population of Vermont was miniscule compared to neighboring states - and correspondingly, the slave population would not have been substantial. 

Nonetheless, I think identifying the number of slaves and their location reveals more about the nature of slavery in the late 18th century. It would address questions like: 

* To what extent was Vermont’s slavery affected by its proximity ties to New York’s thriving slave trade? 
* How effective was legal enforcement in rural America in the late 18th century?
* Did slavery have a greater presence in western Vermont than the east before 1777, corresponding with what we see in the 1790 census? Why did this geographic division exist? And how does it relate to the political division that emerged between the west and east in the 1790s and early 1800s?
* Was the abolition in response to purely religious and ideological conviction, or does the measure hint at movements towards protecting small homesteads against larger farms?

Further pursuit of the topic might require digging into the township level data from New York’s 1771 census. Additional numbers might be available in a 1982 monograph “Vermont 1771 Census” ([https://heritagebooks.com/products/101-h4811](https://heritagebooks.com/products/101-h4811)).

I realized that I didn’t really answer the question at hand! But I wanted to share what I had stumbled on as I unpacked the data that was publicly available."

There's no theory here. Nor is there any convincing such people with all the evidence in the world, anymore than you can convince a flat earther the earth is a globe. They will simply declare it a fabrication and declare all evidences of it fabrication as well.

The Catholic Church could not have invented Roman era coins from South Asia. It never ruled South Asia. And the Brits weren't Catholics, and they ruled India through a period they were pretty anti-catholic. I hope I don't need to prove that the Reformation was a real thing.

The Catholic Church had no reason to construct a building for the worship of pagan gods, built by a worshipper of pagan gods, and rebuilt by other worshippers of pagan gods. Frankly no church has a reason to do this.

Also worth noting that the first were discovered in the 20th century, and the second items in the 21st. I think its safe to say the Catholic Church's ability to fabricate things in England would have been pretty limited by then.

The simple reality is that there are vast amounts of evidence for the Ancient Romans and their Empire. It consists of the sheer wealth of archaeological remains, not the least of which is the city of Rome itself. It consists of thousands of documents, which are, yes, copies from the Medieval era (though not all Christian. Many are also from Islamic sources. Huge chunks of Roman History and culture were rediscovered by Medieval Europeans). It consists of the very influence of language itself, giving name to the Arab dinar (from the roman Denarius) and terms such as the Kaiser-i-Rum, a title used by the Ottomans (very much not a Christian, let alone Catholic state) and a legacy of the Roman claims of the Byzantine Empire.

The idea that the entirety of Rome was fabricated is about as believable as the idea that the Moon is a fabrication and that New Zealand is a conspiracy theory. Or that birds aren't real.

Apologies to the mods for not giving more academic sources and referencing Wikipedia, but I really do feel like generic simple evidence is the best evidence here. I doubt a peer reviewed article will convince someone who can look at the Pantheon of Rome or read Caesar's Gallic Wars and call them Christian Fabrications. Hopefully this does satisfy the requirements for an indepth answer though and I hope this helps answer you OP."

I can't talk too much about why they went away because thats outside of my expertise, but I'll try to illuminate what Schnabelschuhe meant in the (late) medieval context. This answer will be focused on a dispute in Bern, Switzerland, that took place between 1470 and 1471, so if I talk about certain cultural norms, I'm talking about a specific place and date. The cultural meaning of crakwos might fundamentally differ in other places (although I've heard that it was mainly an european thing, so I don't know anything about this being a thing in China or the Ottoman Empire - maybe someone else can shed some light on that?).

**Twingherrenstreit**

A struggle for power raged in Bern in the middle of the 15th century. The city slowly but surely extended its reach, which culminated in the *Twingherrenstreit* (1469-71). The *Twingherren* were powerful members of the nobility who could settle disputes and judge on their lands (they held what was called the *Niedere Gerichtsbarkeit*, a *Twing* or *Zwing* is what we would call a judicial district nowadays), and those powers were what the nobles of Bern tried to undercut in 1469 and set up the city and its *Räte* as sole court. There were two *Räte* in Bern: The *Kleine Rat*, constisting of 27 members of the nobility, and the *Grosse Rat*, which consisted of 200-300 members of the guilds or were otherwise craftmen or trading people. The *Grosse Rat* was specifically built to inhibit the powers of the nobility - so as you can see, more power would be laid into the hands of non-noble people with this move.

The *Twingherren* were not amused. But the escalation came with an election in 1470, where the *Grosse Rat* voted the master butcher Peter Kistler for *Schultheiss* (mayor) of Bern, instead of one of the four *Twingherren* who wanted this highest office. The *Twingherren*, mainly [Adrian I. von Bubenberg](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/Mss-hh-I0003//727) (the guy on the horse with the war hammer - [here ](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/Mss-hh-I0003//692)he is shown in armour), [Niklaus von Diesbach](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/Mss-hh-I0003//215) (the guy in blue kneeling in front of the king) and [Niklaus von Scharnachtal](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/Mss-hh-I0003//738) (the guy on the horse with the fancy hat) were enraged by this coup-like move. They left the city, moved back on their country estates and threatened to get rid of their citizenship.

**But what about the shoes?**

The *Twingherrenstreit* had another dimension: Clothing as distinguishing feature of the nobility. Only they were allowed to wear *Schnabelschuhe* (as well as long trains for women and scandalously short dresses for men, that only reached their knees) - as it was worn at the Burgundian courts. Maybe you've already looked at the footwear of Adrian and the Niklauses in the links above?

The new elites, mainly the bourgeoisie in the *Grossen Rat*, tried to cut down those privileges and in 1464 they outright forbid to wear *Schnabelschuhe*, trains and those short dresses. Such sumptuary laws weren't new - in the 14th century the courts of Zürich tried to keep the people modest and tried to outlaw dresses that were 'sliced' (i.e. trousers), a scandalous new thing emerging from italy. But in this dispute, it was aimed at the nobility instead of the fashionable youth. \[The reason for this new law was - supposedly - a stolen church treasure and a dead priest - something the *Grosse Rat* took as a sign that god was angry at the people of Bern, most probably because of indecencies.\]

In 1470 voting in Peter Kistler as new *Schultheiss* wasn't the only provocation the Grosse Rat did: they simultaneously renewed the sumptuary law from 1464, which provoked the nobility even further.

Those years were years of rising power for Bern, which of course had to be shown off with a huge church, the [Bern minister](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/CH-NB_-_Prov._21_-_Collection_Gugelmann_-_GS-GUGE-PROV-21.tif/lossy-page1-1280px-CH-NB_-_Prov._21_-_Collection_Gugelmann_-_GS-GUGE-PROV-21.tif.jpg) (the start of construction was in 1421) - which by the way took centuries to build. When on the 25th of November the elite of the city was called to the construction site of the minister, the nobility showed up as well - they strode conciously down the halls with all of their forbidden privileges: The women wore long trails, the men short dresses and they all showed off their *Schnabelschuhe*.

Now the burgeoisie was enraged - this was seen (and meant to be) a blatant disrespect of their legislative power. They banished the involved nobility from the city for a whole month and after that a [mediation](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/Mss-hh-I0003//100) (can you spot the noblemen and -women?) took place in order to cool down the two parties.

**Aftermath**

In January 1471, the nobility returned to the city and a new contract for the Twingherren was worked out. Easter monday of the same year, the Twingherr [Petermann von Wabern](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/Mss-hh-I0003//490) (look at those sharp points!) was elected for Schultheiss, who abolished the sumptuary law from 1464/1470 for good.

Now for your question, as to why they completely vanished: I can't give you a definitive answer. The rise of other shoe types (bound shoes/*Bundschuhe* or patent shoes/*lagkeyen Schuhe*) which were worn by all of society/citizens and a further convergence of noble and burgeoise powers might have played a role.

What I wanted to highlight here is the role of the Schnabelschuh as a distinguishing feature of the nobility. While fashion certainly played a role (those shoes were seen as fashionable at the time, because of the the Burgundian court), fashion alone can't grasp the whole of it.

AskHistorians,"I am your average novel reader in Victorian England and I've just finished Oscar Wilde's ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"". How much am I picking up on the undertones, and what would I have known about LGBT activities in Britain?","(1/3)

Thank you for this question. *Dorian Gray* is the reason I got into queer British history as a teenager, so I appreciated digging back into it.

The first (13-chapter) version of *The Picture of Dorian Gray* was first published in the July 1890 edition of the American *Lippincott’s Magazine*. As with everything in Victorian Britain, readers’ understanding of the subtextual (and textual) queerness in it would depend a lot on their class, gender, and where they live. So let’s get a sense of where our  Average Novel Reader stand within that context, and then we’ll work on the juicier stuff.

We’ll begin with location. **Average Novel Reader probably lives in a city or town**. In the 1890s, about 80% of Britons lived in towns or cities of 2500 or larger.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1457s1d/i_am_your_average_novel_reader_in_victorian/#_ftn1) The population of Greater London was about 5,572,000 at the 1891 census.[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1457s1d/i_am_your_average_novel_reader_in_victorian/#_ftn2) Cities have a way of exposing their inhabitants to diverse ways of life, and the history of the city is bound up in both the way historians today understand queerness and the experience of queerness itself. ( /u/xyti099 wrote an answer touching on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ia9sas/history_of_gay_culture_and_mannerisms/).) Urbanization not only made it easier for queer people to find each other and develop communities, but it also put non-queer people in contact with queer people and subcultures. As an urban dweller, even if they’re not queer, Average Novel Reader might at least know that men get up to stuff with each other after dark in the little park around the corner.

**Average Novel Reader is probably middle class**. Unsurprisingly, literacy rates and reading levels were higher among the middle than working classes because working-class kids tended to leave school earlier to, well, work. This isn’t to say that working-class people weren’t voracious readers, but they would have had access to less expensive reading materials. *Lippincott’s* was fairly pricey, running at 1 shilling per monthly installment in 1890. (The [currency converter of the National Archives puts](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency-converter/) 1s in 1890 as equivalent to £4.10 in 2017 money, and a video exhibit at the Imperial War Museum estimates the average weekly wage at the turn of the century at about £1.40.) This was a magazine for the middle classes.

Class matters here because different classes held different expectations for behavior in the realms of gender and sexuality. Middle-class Victorians like our Average Newspaper Reader, were famously concerned with their relatively restrictive standards of sexual propriety (though not as much as we like to think; [the piano-legs-are-scandalous thing is a myth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/74v21l/where_exactly_did_the_victorians_were_a_bunch_of/), as /u/chocolatepot explains). These standards included a clear delineation between public and private, with the “public sphere” the domain of men and the “private sphere” the domain of women, the “angels in the house.” Women and girls were generally shielded from explicit sexual information, and sexual relationships before marriage were unthinkable. Men had more leeway. Perhaps counterintuitively, there was an uneasy acceptance that teenage boys at school—particularly at the prestigious public schools to which upper-middle-class and elite families sent their sons—might have sexual relationships with each other. The important thing was that, as the boys grew into men, they became more interested in women than other dudes, and the ultimate expectation was that a middle-class man would settle down to support a wife and children. Working-class Victorians tended to be more pragmatic than dogmatic in areas of gender and sexuality. Their living conditions did not permit the same public/private divide, and much of working-class Victorian life took place in communal spaces like the streets in front of a block of flats. Casual sexual encounters between working-class men weren’t exactly celebrated, but it was accepted that they would happen. Also, sex before marriage was perhaps not the ideal, but was certainly not ruinous to a working-class woman’s social life as it would be for her middle-class contemporaries. (See an older answer by /u/chocolatepot [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rjhkf/ive_read_that_it_was_incredibly_normal_for_brides/). It focuses on an earlier time period, but the vibes are the same at the end of the century.)

Anyway, as a middle-class person Average Novel Reader will be more aware of queer possibilities if they’re a man, less if they’re a woman. But our **Reader** **could be either a man or a woman.** *Lippincott’s* was a literary magazine with broad appeal across genders.

So we have our urban, middle-class Average Novel Reader of indeterminate gender. How would they have read Wilde’s text?"

AskHistorians,What is the current consensus on Roger Ekirch’s whole First Sleep and Second Sleep hypothesis about how pre-modern humans apparently slept in two periods with a segment of activity in between?,"I'll repost [an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fanssm/have_sleep_patterns_always_been_the_same_i_read/fizwti7/) from two years ago which comes from [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fanssm/have_sleep_patterns_always_been_the_same_i_read/) where myself, /u/antiquarianism, and /u/sagathain among others discussed this in depth.  

I don't recall seeing anything in the two big sleep journals in the couple of years since, and the only [major new article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721821000309?via%3Dihub) I found in a *very* brief search - it's worth keeping in mind you're asking this on a holiday - was a 2021 metaanalysis that bears this out in both the lit (the most recent paper cited was 2020) along with the conclusion, which continues to suggest modern era polyphasic sleep generally leads to a lower quality of sleep by most metrics.

---

How's this for an answer: some likely did, but others likely didn't.

One caveat: I'm coming at this from a slightly different angle, which is familiarity with the history of sleep research rather than that of the eras you're asking about - so it's one reason I'm hopeful some of the medievalists and early modernists here chime in as I'm quite curious what (if any) debate there's been on this in their fields.

That said, the main contributor to noctural biphasic theory (versus biphasic in general, which can refer to daytime siestas as well) is a historian at Virginia Tech by the name of Roger Ekrich, who back in 2004 wrote a survey of nocturnal habits throughout the world, *At Day's Close - Night in Times Past*.  While much of the book dealt with various societal oddities throughout Europe at night, the one that caught the most traction was his analysis of literature that suggested that pre-industrial age humans slept somewhat differently than we do today:

>Until the close of the early modern era, Western Europeans on most evenings experienced two major intervals of sleep bridged by up to an hour or more of quiet wakefulness. In the absence of fuller descriptions, fragments in several languages in sources ranging from depositions and diaries to imaginative literature give clues to the essential features of this puzzling pattern of repose. The initial interval of slumber was usually referred to as “first sleep,” or, less often, “first nap” or “dead sleep.” In French, the term was premier sommeil or premier somme, in Italian, primo sonno or primo sono, and in Latin, primo somno or concubia nocte. The succeeding interval of sleep was called “second” or “morning” sleep, whereas the intervening period of wakefulness bore no name, other than the generic term “watch” or “watching.” Alternatively, two texts refer to the time of  of “first waking.”

>Both phases of sleep lasted roughly the same length of time, with individuals waking sometime after midnight before returning to rest. Not everyone, of course, slept according to the same timetable. The later at night that persons went to bed, the later they stirred after their initial sleep; or, if they retired past midnight, they might not awaken at all until dawn. Thus in “The Squire’s Tale” in The Canterbury Tales, Canacee slept “soon after evening fell” and subsequently awakened in the early morning following “her first sleep”; in turn, her companions, staying up much later, “lay asleep till it was fully prime” (daylight). William Baldwin’s satire Beware the Cat recounts a quarrel between the protagonist, “newly come unto bed,” and two roommates who “had already slept” their “first sleep.”

>Men and women referred to both intervals as if the prospect of awakening in the middle of the night was common knowledge that required no elaboration....

Ekrich goes on to review a reasonable amount of contemporary literature that suggested this was fairly commonplace and to note a series of early 1990 [experiments by Thomas Wehr at the NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607034) that artificial light appeared to be one of the primary culprits responsible for disturbing biphasic sleep, along with a walk through what people actually used to do in the middle of the night.

So far, so good, and Ekrich continued this research across cultures and [published](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-history/faculty/a-roger-ekirch.html) in several fairly well respected journals, lectured in front of medical faculties, and even is on the board of the main publication of the National Sleep Foundation.

Except then in the early 2010s, his theory took a bit of a hit. Several anthropologists got interested in the subject, and realized that their field provided a fantastic opportunity to check on this with current day isolated preindustrial societies.  The result was a 2015 paper, [*Natural sleep and its seasonal variations in three societies*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720388/), that went a step further and put Actiwatches on current day pre-industrial societies near the equator - and noted precisely none of them experienced biphasic sleep.

[Ekrich's response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763365/#B4) is quite interesting, and in a sign of the importance his theories had gained it appeared in what's considered the main sleep research journal, *Sleep*.  But the relevant part for your question is this portion:

>As I have recently written at length, consolidated sleep to which the industrialized world aspires, if not always successfully—due perhaps to the persistence of this once dominant pattern—is for Western societies a remarkably youthful form of sleep, a product not of the primeval past but of forces grounded in technology (artificial illumination) and shifting cultural attitudes toward sleep over the course of the Industrial Revolution. ***This is not to argue that segmented sleep has been the predominant pattern of sleep among all preindustrial peoples in the non-Western world.*** [emphasis added]

So, the best answer is probably that it depended on the population and possibly where they're located, along with how much artificial light they were exposed to."
AskHistorians,Did witchfinders ever find anyone innocent?,"So, what I'm about to say must come with a significant caveat: I'm not a specialist in witch history, and only really know about witchcraft in the Holy Roman Empire. Regional variation was *massive*; in some areas (e.g., Normandy, if I recall correctly), men were prosecuted more than women! What I'm saying here goes strictly for only what I say, though my impression is that these observations are broadly representative.

What must be remembered when talking about witchcraft is that while it may seem ""irrational"" from our viewpoint - which is so much more ""modern"" and ""rational""! ...well, sometimes - most early modern people sincerely believed in witchcraft. They saw maleficent magical power as a genuine threat, and wanted to make sure that they took out that threat. Wouldn't you? Belief in magical maleficence is pretty common worldwide, after all.^(1) But they also believed in justice, and (generally) believed that they could be wrong.

Mild content warning for the next paragraph.

In 1527, one Margareth Los, an inhabitant of the Duchy of Württemberg, was accused of witchcraft. After being whisked away in the streets, she was brutally tortured; I won't go into the graphic details, but her account is translated in full in the paper I cite below. It was so bad, it seems her perception of time was completely thrown out of joint (consistent with modern understandings of the psychological impact of extreme physical torture). While the details are unclear, it seems she was tortured for days, if not weeks, on end. But she never confessed. As a result, she was locked up for three and a half years, and then expelled from the Duchy. However, she was never prosecuted for witchcraft.^(2)

As a result, she couldn't be prosecuted, since there was no other evidence to go on. The rule of law mattered even in witchcraft trials, something that can be seen in other examples (as that of Elizabeth Lorenz), even if not all the time.^(3) Lots of educated legal commentators were actively worried about how popular prejudice and fear could produce over-hasty judgements, and made sure that they influenced trials against this. In fact, Los actually launched a legal complaint about her treatment, and her torturer, Jakob Furderer (unfortunate name; I'm reminded of Hannibal Lecter), was criticized for his conduct in court. However, she didn't manage to secure more than some compensation for her properties that were sold whilst she was imprisoned.^(4) Even so, the point stands: not only was she not convicted, she managed to get a little bit of justice for her mistreatment.

More powerful people generally had recourse to better methods. Katharina, mother of the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler, was prosecuted for witchcraft in the 1620s, and he made sure to use all of the considerable intellectual and political friendships and favours he had to get her off. Unsurprisingly, he was successful.^(5) However, it wasn't always so easy. In the ecclesiastical principality of Bamberg in the late 1620s, one Dorothea Flockh was imprisoned and tried for witchcraft. She and her family were very well-connected indeed: they appealed first to regional authorities and powers, and then to the Emperor himself, Ferdinand II. However, even the Emperor ordering the Prince-Bishop to release her and stop the trial (so it could be conducted fairly in Vienna) couldn't save her, and in 1630, she was executed. Her newborn baby (she gave birth in captivity) was ripped from her arms moments before she was decapitated.^(6)

This caused *massive* outrage. Of course, part of that was because an Imperial prince had defied the orders of the Emperor himself, multiple times. However, a lot of it was because this was widely viewed as a perversion of justice. Witchfinders were *expected* to find innocent people innocent, and Flockh was widely perceived as an innocent woman - or at least one who hadn't properly been found guilty. That she had just given birth and was torn from her child before being judicially murdered just added to the tragedy, especially for the many powerful people who knew (or knew of) her.

So, yes, in answer to your question, witchfinders did find people innocent. In some places, they did it quite a lot; I believe overall across Europe, ""only"" 50% of those accused of witchcraft went to the stake.^(7) In some areas, this number was quite a bit higher, and it was certainly expected that anyone who was genuinely innocent would be let go - though it might well take torture to establish ""genuine innocence"". The witch trials were in many regards horrific, but it would be a mistake to regard them as wholly mindless exercises in random violence.

AskHistorians,"During the 69AD Roman Civil War, four Roman Legions fought against each other in the Battle of Bedriacum. 9 months later the legions were fighting side by side against the Batavians. How did Rome reconcile these groups?","Regarding your general remark in the body text, I can't be that sure on how the opponent Roman legions & soldiers could have cooperated after a civil war as a rule. I guess this would be explained in a general way by the mercenary character of the armies, by just changing sides, detachments, deaths, disbandments, reorganizing, strategic army movements and placements etc. But as in your title question you're mentioning the 4 legions in the battle of Bedriacum, let's see this specific case.

Main source for these events is Tacitus' Histories, and I presume that by the term 'battle of Bedriacum' \[Cremona\] you should mean here mainly the 1st one, between Otho & Vitellius, cause of the number of the involved legions.

For this first battle \[April 69 CE\] where Vitellius won, Tacitus \[Hist. 2.43\] is mentioning for Vitellius the legion XXI Rapax & the V. This last one \[the fifth legion\] has been mostly interpreted as the legion V Alaudae. And for Otho are mentioned the legions I Adiutrix, the XIII \[Gemina?\] and the XIV \[Gemina?\].

These three defeated Otho's legions, they all seem joining Vespasian afterwards against Vitellius again; but this time winning. And all three will participate against the Batavian revolt. Specifically:

* The legion I Adiutrix seems to be transferred in Spain after the battle by Vitellius so to calm down \[Tac. Hist. 2.67: 'ut pace et otio mitesceret'\]. Then it's mentioned that being still hostile to Vitellius has favored the following contender Vespasian in Spain in 69 CE \[Tac. Hist. 3.44\]. And afterwards it was called from there by Petilius Cerialis \[for Vespasian\] against the Batavian revolt in 70 CE \[Tac. Hist. 4.68\].
* The legion XIII \[Gemina?\] after the battle was ordered by Vitellius to build amphitheatres \[Tac. Hist. 2.67\]. The whole of it or part in Pannonia, still hostile to Vitellius, joins the following contender Vespasian \[Tac. Hist. 2.86\]. It participates in the 2nd battle of Bedriacum / Cremona in autumn of 69 CE \[Tac. Hist. 3.21 & .27\], where the forces of Vespasian won Vitellius. And it will be transferred by Petilius Cerialis \[for Vespasian\] against the Batavian revolt in 70 CE \[Tac. Hist. 4.68\].
* The legion XIV \[Gemina?\] after the battle seems remaining faithful to Otho and will be transported to Britain by Vitellius \[Tac. Hist. 2.66\]. It will be called to join Vespasian against Vitellius \[Tac. Hist. 2.86\], and an inclination \[favor\] for Vespasian is recorded in Britain \[Tac. Hist. 3.44\]. It will be called too from Britain by Petilius Cerialis \[for Vespasian\] against the Batavian revolt in 70 CE \[Tac. Hist. 4.68\].

Regarding the two legions of Vitellius:

* The legion V Alaudae after the 1st battle of Bedriacum seems remaining faithful to Vitellius during his war against Vespasian \[Tac. Hist. 3.14\] and fought in the 2nd battle of Bedriacum / Cremona in autumn of 69 CE \[Tac. Hist. 3.22\]. It's also mentioned as one of the two legions defending Vetera against Civilis during the Batavian revolt \[Tac. Hist. 4.35 & 4.21\], while the war between Vitellius and Vespasian was still going on. By this they should be understood as remaining detachments. The Vetera defenders seem to be killed by Civilis \[Tac. Hist. 4.60\]; thus most probably legion V too. At the time when this siege started, Civilis seems actually helping Vespasian \[cf. Tac. Hist. 4.21\], though Vespasian's victory was announced during this time \[cf. Tac. Hist. 4.31-.32\].
* The legion XXI Rapax after the 1st battle of Bedriacum fought again for Vitellius in the 2nd against Vespasian \[Tac. Hist. 3.18 & 3.22\]. After Vitellius' defeat, it will be transferred by Petilius Cerialis \[for Vespasian\] against the Batavian revolt in 70 CE \[Tac. Hist. 4.68\]. It's characteristic that in this last case the legion is specified as one the 'Vitellian legions' \[Vitellianarum\], more possibly distinguishing it from the rest.

From these the only case that seems to have the criteria you've set is the last one of the legion XXI Rapax; which fought for Vitellius against Otho and Vespasian, but then joined the army of Petilius Cerialis \[for Vespasian\] to suppress the Batavian revolt. It actually seems to travel along with the aforementioned opponent legion XIII \[Gemina?\] when Petilius Cerialis was gathering army \[Tac. Hist. 4.68\], and fighting against the revolt of the Batavi \[Tac. Hist. 4.70 & 4.78\].

It seems however unclear how close was with its former eneny legions; eg. when Petilius was moving these legions \[Tac. Hist. 4.68\] they are mentioned three different possible roads.

While a really interesting instance is narrated by Tacitus around their warfare \[Hist. 4.70\]:

>The legion XXI Rapax seems co-operating against the Batavian revolt with some forces of Sextilius Felix and an 'ala Singularium' formed by Vitellius but later joined Vespasian. So there's a clear example of changing sides.  
>  
>And right afterwards Tacitus writes that the Roman troops that had joined the Batavian revolt fought successfully against Sextilius Felix forces, but when the Roman legions approached, they committed an honorable desertion \['honesto transfugio rediere'\]; probably as they didn't want to fight against Romans.

So both aspects could appear."

AskHistorians,The “overkill” hypothesis suggests that humans were the primary cause behind the death of megafauna. Is there evidence of this predatory nature in more recent history about Native American hunting practices?,"##Part 1

The overkill hypothesis was first proposed in 1966 by Paul Martin who placed megafaunal extinction events in various parts of the globe alongside human migration patterns. Looking specifically at the Quaternary Extinction Event in the Late Pleistocene, he theorized that humans were the primary cause behind the disappearance of various megafauna through overhunting for subsistence means and then subsequent ecosystem collapses that occurred after the disappearance of herbivorous mammals, unabashedly proclaiming “man, and man alone, was responsible.” For this answer, I will be looking at North America and the ancestors of today’s contemporary Native Americans.^1

###Indigenous Peoples and Ideological Narratives

Key to understanding the relevance of this question for Indigenous Peoples is that the overkill hypothesis has been frequently cited over the last 50+ years to suggest that Native Americans, either our distance ancestors or our more recent relatives, are opportunistic primitive hunters that are anti-environment and abusive toward the natural world. This accusation usually gets bundled up as an observation about human nature purporting that we are entirely biologically driven beings focused on self-preservation. The accusation then becomes much more palatable as it is perceived as a comment about innate human activity rather than any single grouping. The overkill hypothesis has been used over the years as a clear example of the effect humans have on ecosystems and why we need to be mindful about our actions.^2

Where this becomes concerning for Indigenous Peoples is that we maintain an identity that is necessarily linked to the original inhabitants of our respective lands, thus being constantly defined in opposition to the non-Indigenous populations surrounding us. Interpretations of the deep past regarding human activity therefore have a direct insinuation for the descendants of said inhabitants and impugns upon our traditional customs that we choose to maintain as part of our distinct cultural identities. The implications assert that our knowledge and practices regarding the environment, what is now typically referred to a “traditional ecological knowledge” (TEK), are actually anachronistic components of a falsified assessment of the behaviors of Indigenous Peoples, working to devalue the knowledge of Indigenous Peoples developed over thousands of years of societal development, land stewardship, and value-system manifestation.^3 In other words, notions like the overkill hypothesis have significant sociopolitical ramifications for Indigenous Peoples today especially as we work to assert Indigenous-based values as a way to address our current climate and environmental crises. What my commentary here seeks to do is provide evidence that directly challenges some of the aspects of the overkill hypothesis by bringing in a more recent historical analysis of Indigenous hunting practices to dispel distorted narratives that are used to dismiss contemporary arguments about modern land stewardship advocacy and expose the ideological component that is at the core of such accusations present in ideas such as the overkill hypothesis.

###Megafauna Extinction: Humans, Climate, or…?

While evidence does indicate that extinctions of megafauna in North America roughly coincides with human *migration* patterns, some of the data is incongruous with other patterns of human *habitation.* For example, Surovell et al. (2015) indicate that Martin's hypothesis rests on the notion of human migration *into* the Americas coinciding with the beginning of mass extinction periods, providing several ranges of dates to confer this. Although this radiocarbon dating study initially agrees with Martin's estimate of the introduction of humans, approximately 13,600 BP, it is hampered [by the](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/03/when-did-humans-settle-north-america/10223278002/) numerous [findings](https://www.livescience.com/first-north-americans-30000-years-ago.html) that human [habitation](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53486868) in the [Americas](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53486868) extends further back than the estimations Martin was using. The Surovell et al. (2015) even state the following:

>The curve for [Eastern Beringia] suggests that megafaunal population levels remained relatively constant from ∼45,000 to 15,000 BP with a few minor periods of increase, most notably around the Last Glacial Maximum. This peak may imply that glacial climatic conditions are particularly favorable for extinct megafauna in arctic regions, when the so-called “Mammoth Steppe” flourished. This pattern conforms well to Guthrie’s hypothesis that size diminution among Alaskan Pleistocene horses was linked to post-LGM climatic and ecological change.

In other words, humans in the Americas were already coexisting with megafauna populations long before the extinction events took place, even according to a recent study that more or less endorses the overkill hypothesis (and despite it being less relevant due to not accounting for more recent human settlement dates). Rather than attributing the death of North American megafauna solely to Indigenous Peoples, perhaps we should turn to the fact that it was the end of the last ice age, meaning there were [massive changes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379110003963) to the climate that [undoubtedly impacted megafauna populations.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21201-8) Not only that, but evidence indicates that early peoples of the Americas didn't even hunt most of the fauna that went extinct during this period, let alone in such massive numbers as to be the sole cause for their extinction.^4

One of the more notable examples of humans actively hunting megafauna comes from one of the last instances of mammoth habitation prior to their extinction: [Wrangel Island.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangel_Island#First_human_settlements_and_the_extinction_of_the_woolly_mammoth) Despite the lack of archaeological evidence indicating the predation of the mammoths here, it is sometimes regarded as a sort of “control sample” where we can see the relatively quick extinction of a species once humans arrived to the island.

The issue with island data is that it *doesn't* function as a control sample in this regard. It is an isolated incident in where the mammoth population was already going extinct, encountering a genetic meltdown, experiencing the effects of climate change, and was boxed into a confined geographic location--all elements that made it convenient for their demise to be at the hands of human predation. As a counterexample to Wrangel Island, we need look no further than [St. Paul Island]( https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/st-paul-island-mammoths-most-accurately-dated-prehistoric-extinction-ever/) where the mammoth population experienced a rapidly changing landscape that led to its demise:

> Humans did not arrive on the island until 1787 C.E. The only large mammals present were mammoths … The island, which formed between 14,700 and 13,500 years ago rapidly shrank until 9,000 years ago and continued slowly shrinking until 6,000 years ago and now is only 42 square miles in area. While large animals like mammoths became extinct on the continents about 12,000 years ago due to climate change and habitat restructuring, the process was different on the island. The shrinking of the island concentrated the mammoths in a smaller area and diminished available water ... Both of these things increased erosion in the area and helped fill in the lake, decreasing the available water even more.

The reality is that the debate around this topic [is complicated,](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/laelaps/the-problem-with-ice-age-overkill/) but it is pretty clear that attributing the death of North American megafauna to Indigenous Peoples is becoming increasingly silly. This isn’t to say that early waves of humans didn’t hunt these animals as there is evidence to prove that this is highly likely. Nor am I suggesting that earlier humans in the Americas didn’t have an ecologically significant impact on their environments [as it is pretty]( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-downplay-the-role-of-indigenous-people-in-molding-the-ecological-landscape/) clear that [we did.]( https://archive.ph/MWuQ7) What I am saying is that a combination of factors—climate change, landscape changes, and predation changes—all culminated into a series of factors that interplayed with each other that ultimately contributed to the extinction of megafauna worldwide and the growth of the human population. To neglect the multitude of factors involved is simply an exercise in ideological rhetoric that is pointedly anti-Indigenous as the implications are conferred upon no other group but the successors to the first peoples of the Americas.

**Edit:** A word."
AskHistorians,"Reagan once told a joke where a Soviet man ordered a car, there being a 10 year waiting period. What was obtaining and owning a car actually like in the Soviet Union?","I regret to inform you that, in fact, 10 years of wait time was quite possible. In 1990 Nestorović (in _L'industrie automobile à l'Est_) gives a figure of ""2 to 12 years depending on the country"".

To backtrack a bit, the personal vehicle market didn't really jumpstart until the 1960s. In 1960 there was 1 car for every 424 people; in 1980 this went up to 1 car for every 35 people. Prior to 1960 a car for private use was not a priority for planners, but past that, development started to accelerate. Passenger car output went from 200,000 to 1965 to 1.2 million in 1975.

One historically significant plant in 1966 was a collaboration between Italy (specifically the company Fiat) and the Soviet Union. The VAZ plant started work on the first version of the Lada, a ""people's car"" modeled after the Fiat 124. The Fiat 124 was lightweight, but for the Soviet market it was beefed up with Russian driving in mind; suspension was raised (for rougher roads) the body was thicker, and a manual auxiliary fuel pump was added to handle ultracold weather.

The [VAZ-2101](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/1980_-_VAZ_2101.JPG/1280px-1980_-_VAZ_2101.JPG) eventually rolled out in 1970, and the same plant was extended to produce other car types (Moskvich and Zaporozhets), leading to a tripling in auto production from 1970 to 1975.

For actually obtaining a vehicle, there was a process dependent on status. High ranking officials, medal holders (things like the Lenin Prize), managing executives, and Heroes of Labor were the sort of person given top priority, followed by people in rural areas, followed by distinguished production workers.

People who didn't fall into a special category went on a longer waiting list, where a wait of 10 years was indeed not absurd. Hungary had up to a 6 year wait, Bulgaria had up to a 12 year wait.  Uzhgorod, Ukraine in 1977 had a 5-7 year wait on average, and even those of ""elite"" status needed to wait a year. At the end of the Cold War the waiting list for GDR hit somewhere between 1.5 and 1.8 million requests, although it is unknown how many of those were ""real"" orders, because people without the money for a car would put themselves on a waiting list (hopeful that by the time X years had passed, they would have the money by then). Relatedly, vehicles were costly compared to salaries. Surveys conducted from 1978 to 1983 gave an average of 8 years as the amount of time it took to save for a vehicle.

Infrastructure also lagged; in 1982 ""more than"" 160 parts were hard-to-find and service stations were only at roughly 30% of demand.

While there was an ""official"" used car market (not counting the black market, here) it went through the authorities, with a charge for safety inspection. There was enough demand that people were willing to pay more than the official posted prices (often double); in such a case two people would do a person-to-person agreement, where the car was bought officially, and then the buyer also paid the excess agreed upon to the seller.

The black market aspect is hard to quantify; a 1987 study on 1982 data estimated for the fuel consumption of private cars (7.5 billion liters) a full three quarters of it was done on the black market. By its very nature any sort of illicit change of money is obscured in the data.

The USSR threw great energy into production but never managed to match the West. By the end of the Cold War the USSR (and the Eastern Bloc) as a whole had a motor vehicle production of 3.2 million per year (population 398 million); France (just France) produced 3.7 million units per year. That is, France produced more vehicles than the entirety of Eastern Europe.

AskHistorians,"When Constantinople was established as the new capital of the Roman Empire, was there a migration of officials and institutions from Italy or did Constantine and his successors rebuild the Roman government from the ground up?","Basically, he did both, though more the former than the latter. Our early sources on Constantinople are not the best (and what we do have is more church-oriented), so a lot of it is based on conjecture, but we can vaguely understand how the process worked.

As you rightly say, the idea of the imperial court and bureaucracy creating ""new Romes"" in the frontier regions was not new, even including the construction of certain buildings imitating Rome. Licinius, whom Constantine defeated in the civil wars, had even done this in Byzantium (probably one of the motivating factors for Constantine's move there). Of course, these structures are always shifting over time, but they remained relatively fixed after Diocletian's reforms, despite their varying locations. With that said, Constantine certainly reformed the administration and centralized it more directly under imperial authority. It's hard to say too much, given the sources, but it seems like he mainly expanded and modified the existing bureaucracy rather than adding new institutions *de novo*. And this was also largely separate from the founding of Constantinople itself, with the bureaucratic center being instead tied to wherever the emperor was, as it had been under the tetrarchs and before.

But what Constantine did was quite different, signaled clearly by his creation of a new senate. According to Hesychios (fragments of whose *patria*, a sort of mythologically infused history of the city, survive), they were partly made up of imported senators from Rome, for whom Constantine built the kind of luxurious manses they would expect back in Italy.  But they were also drawn, as you suspect, from the provincial elites of the Aegean world. The sources are often very degrading toward them (describing them as sons of butchers, cheesemongers, etc.), but they seem to have been perfectly reputable local elites who were now promoted to senators by Constantine and given a cushy place in the new capital. Now, the senate did not have much authority with regard to the military or foreign policy, but they were certainly important to the local civilian administration, playing much the same role they had settled into in Rome.



**Sources/Further Reading**

Raymond Van Dam is probably the most prominent scholar who covers this topic, and both his  *Rome and Constantinople: Rewriting Roman History during Late Antiquity* and *The Roman Revolution of Constantine* are great places for further reading, as well as sources for this answer. I'd also direct attention to the *Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine*, especially the article on ""Bureaucracy and Government"" by Christopher Kelly."
AskHistorians,Marcus Aurelius' writings implied the possibility that gods might be unjust or non-existent. Did this cause much controversy in Roman society? How did Roman religious authorities respond to his writings?,"As pointed out in the thread you linked, the execution of Socrates also had underlying political reasons, due to his connections with the Thirty Tyrants' regime; this is stressed by u/KiwiHellenist in [his answer on the matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/imlp2g/how_far_was_socrates_execution_a_response_to_his/).

Also, the *Meditations* were written as diaries and not published until after his death (""Aurē'lius, Marcus"" in *The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,* 3rd edition, 2011, ed. M.C. Howatson), so there was no reaction to the work in his lifetime (not that we know of certainly until the Byzantine period). In addition, Marcus Aurelius was the emperor; it is not like anyone would try him in court. The Caesars could face rebellion or conspiracy of course, but it is unlikely the publication of some personal ideas that were religiously unorthodox would have caused that; for instance Elagabalus, who tried to introduce radical changed to the Roman religion (and, if we believe our sources, also completely flouted gender and sexual roles) reigned for over three years before being assassinated. The same was true to a certain extent with Gaius 'Caligula' and Nero.

 Furthermore, it is clear from other parts of the *Meditations* that Marcus Aurelius did believe in some kind of divinity, and appears to have been a devout participant in religious rituals:  this is explained in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6ate8w/did_roman_emperors_actually_believe_in_the_gods/) by u/QVCatullus and u/BaffledPlato, as well as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/da0cmj/did_roman_emperors_actually_believe_in_the/) by u/toldinstone.

AskHistorians,How did Jains (the Indian religion with a radical commitment to nonviolence against any and all beings) react to germ theory and the discovery of microorganisms?,[removed]
AskHistorians,Was the Ghost Dance seen as a real threat? Was the religion used as a scapegoat in the aftermath of the Wounded Knee Massacre?,"The short answer is yes: despite both posing little threat and not really trying to offer one, American settler colonists thought the Ghost Dance was a real threat. But this was true mainly in a specific time and place.

Americans began to read about the “Ghost Dance” or the “Messiah craze” as it was often called in 1889/1890 newspapers, about a year after Wovoka/Jack Wilson began to have his visions. Newspapers breathlessly reported on how tribe after tribe began to indulge in this, noting how it spread to nearby and faraway reservations. They consistently misunderstood the tenets of the theology and interpreted it as a hostile religion bent on exterminating the white man, resurrecting fallen indigenous Americans, and so on.

You need to read these in the context of the racism of the time. Americans thought that Indians were destined for a slow and steady oblivion. The “good” side of the mainstream thought that they ought to be assimilated into white society and their culture erased forever; the “bad” side of mainstream thought this was a fools’ errand. Closely tied up with this was the twin understanding that Indians were innately hostile and that American frontiersmen had to prove their mettle by defending the homestead. You can see this in the language of the time—people consistently termed the idea of an indigenous rebellion an “outbreak.”

The rising of an “Indian Messiah” was understood to be a provocation for an outbreak. Newspapers especially began to fixate on this when it came to the Lakota Sioux, who had only recently been subdued, and were of course the subject of the most famous American frontier legend, Custer’s Last Stand at the battle of Little Bighorn. Despite the fact that the Lakota’s horses had already been confiscated in the previous peace treaty, the “Messiah craze” was widely understood to be driving them into a frenzy, and that they would possibly attack and kill neighboring settlers. This was amplified by “yellow journalism”—or what we in the modern age would probably call “fake news”—the practice of newspapers to reprint or plagiarize (with or without attribution) reports by other newspapers, neither of which probably had a reporter on the scene. Stories began to spread that Ghost Dancers believed the dance and the eponymous “ghost shirts” would protect them from bullets.

(It is unclear whether or not these “ghost shirts” actually existed. The earliest scholarship gives them a lot of benefit of the doubt. Later scholarship is more mixed. Note more generally, however, that the general nonviolent ideology of the Ghost Dancers—Lakota and others—is no longer disputed by modern historians, due especially to some interesting archival sources only rediscovered in the last twenty years.)

This escalated further, as famous Lakota were implicated in endorsing/not endorsing the Ghost Dance (the latter wasn’t exactly taken as exonerating evidence), especially the legendary Sitting Bull (one of the leaders in Little Bighorn). Yellow journalism repeated stories about supposed Indian plots to trap and kill military soldiers, supposedly overheard from Indian scouts.

Meanwhile, the Indian Agents in charge of the reservations tried desperately to keep a handle on the situation, even as settlers called for the Army to be deployed. Eventually, the military did deploy to the Lakota reservation at Pine Ridge.

It seems most likely that the Army was itching for a fight pretty much regardless of what went down. (Notably, one of the units deployed to Pine Ridge was the Seventh Cavalry, formerly Custer’s unit.) Tensions were already high when local Indian police assassinated Sitting Bull; they got higher when Chief Big Foot led a band of starving, freezing Lakota across South Dakota, hoping to find food and shelter at Pine Ridge. The Seventh Cavalry moved to regulate their approach, and confiscated their weapons. Mid-confiscation, a gun went off (most likely in a struggle between a young Lakota warrior and an army private trying to secure it), and the Army slaughtered the Lakota with repeating cannon. It was a few days after Christmas.

(There were some wounded on the US side; they were almost certainly entirely from friendly fire. The Army awarded over twenty Medals of Honor for participation in the massacre.)

The Ghost Dance, then, was absolutely a trigger here, and whites definitely thought it was a genuine threat. But this is only one of several causes; the US news media only really thought it a threat because it was happening on the Lakota reservation. This is almost certainly because of the recency of the Sioux Wars, the fact that Custer had been martyred only fourteen years before, and that even after these wars, the Lakota were probably the most powerful tribe within American borders. Racism played a huge role as well, as did the amplification by careless newspaper reporting.

And notably, outside the Lakota area, basically nothing untoward happened. The Ghost Dance continued to be practiced for decades after Wounded Knee. It was largely suppressed on Pine Ridge and other Lakota reservations, but there were numerous dances in the Oklahoma/Indian Territory reservations in the years immediately after; Wovoka continued to receive indigenous representatives near the Paiute reservations, and large dances were still held there and across the Southwest at least into the 1920s.

No military effort was made to stop these. Note that Wovoka himself was never under threat from military or police; he lived a free man until his death. Americans largely considered the movement to be dying/vanishing/ending. The anthropologist James Mooney, the first to study it, ended his book with Wounded Knee. More generally, it fit into a narrative that the Indians were vanishing—the Ghost Dance was seen as a “last gasp” of Indianness. Because this was (and is!) such a powerful trope, the newspaper reports well into the 1920s say the exact same thing—every iteration of the Ghost Dance was presented as the last gasp of a dying race.

So, to summarize:

Yes, it was seen as a real threat—especially among the Lakota—but this largely went away after Wounded Knee. This brief panic was almost entirely stoked by yellow journalism, and probably gained credence because of the recent history of the US conflicts with the Lakota.


For further reading, the best overall treatment of the ghost dance is Louis Warren, God’s Red Son. A couple of pieces that deal with the newspaper-stoked panic include Hugh Reilly’s The Frontier Newspapers and the Coverage of the Plains Indian Wars, and Oliver Knight’s Following the Indian Wars.

AskHistorians,Why did women so often stay in bed with headaches in the Victorian period?,"This is a very interesting question! Although headaches are not specifically my area of focus, I do focus on popular medicine and it appears that the 19th century saw significant changes in the treatment of the headache, as well as its identification. Towards the start of the 20th century, physicians’ identification of types of headaches shifted from bilious and sick headaches to the more modern understandings of migraines and headaches (1). As much as the victorians would have loved to have denied it, many of their medical practices and traditions were still very much galenic in practice, and the practice of physic was slowly shifting from treating symptoms to identifying specific etiologies. 

Many victorian and 19th century medical texts identify women as being more at risk for headaches, migraines, and more feminine-oriented diseases, but menstruation had a very different set of terms. Headaches were not a female-specific disease, as many of the popular medical publications of the time show (2), but there were diseases considered to be specific to women. Similarly, headaches could be caused by some of these feminine issues (5). Examples of these include the suppression of the courses, menses-related diseases, and diseases of virginity like green sickness. (3) By the 1800s the names for diseases had changed quite a bit from the century before, where menstrual issues were often described with terms like “suppression of the courses” (4), but the act of menstruating and cramps from menstruation weren’t alluded to via headache. Issues with menstruation could be a cause of a larger issue, like pleurisy, according to some medical manuals (5, 284).

That being said, there are times where the cure for the headache is simply rest and times in which the recommendation is something stronger. Books like Gunn’s *Domestic Medicine* describe nervous headaches as “[arising] from the same causes as those which produce tooth aches in female diseases, and which may be produced, also, by grief or any of the depressing passions, and should be treated by gentle stimulants.” He, earlier in the book, claims that toothaches in females arise from “stoppages of certain evacuations.” (5, 304). He also claims that about a half of all female complaints of toothaches are often the result of bodily habit or nervous sympathy. Basically, the idea of women as being of delicate constitution meant both that headaches could be from some issue with her period, a nervous issue, or simply a headache. The section on headaches refers to a woman with a “sick headache” (one that originates in the stomach and comes with nausea) curing herself with citric acid — whether true or not, the variety of headaches and treatments at this time meant that many assumed headaches were either a result of nervous disposition, menstrual issues, or another issue with her body (5, 328). Apologies about the formatting, I’m doing this on mobile and have absolutely no clue how to do superscript.

AskHistorians,"Was Jerry Lee Lewis really as surprised as he was portrayed in later retellings at the backlash outside his community to his marriage to his underage cousin? For that matter, how normalized actually were such marriages in his mid-20th c. rural Louisiana/Mississippi context?","For my answer, I will be heavily referencing the book *Hellfire: The Jerry Lee Lewis Story* by Nick Tosches. As a warning, this answer is long and requires a lot of context.

For the context of the time period, Elvis had just joined the army and was out of Lewis's way in terms of competition. Lewis himself had just starred in the upcoming film *High School Confidential*, which would earn $1.4 million in profit ($14 million in today's money) and had just released a single of the same name that just barely missed the top 20. Sun Records was also about to release his first LP. And on top of it all, Jerry Lee Lewis was about to tour England thanks to Oscar ""The Baron"" Davis; thirty shows, $26,000 ($267,024.50 in today's money), and a whole new market to sell records.

For the context of his marriage, Jerry Lee had married Myra Gale Brown - the daughter of his cousin J.W., making her his first cousin once removed - twice; the first marriage (taking place in December of 1957) was unlawful, as Jerry Lee had still been married to Jane Mitchum, his second wife. The scandal broke out before Jerry and Myra had married the second time in June of 1958. Nonetheless, there had been some concerns among Jerry's circle regarding the wedding; during a pre-tour stop in New York to wait for Oscar Davis, Jerry was approached by Sam Phillips (the owner of Sun Records) and Sam's brother Judd. Both had previously advised Jerry to keep the marriage a secret, but Judd now asked how Jerry was going to approach the press about the matter.

""She's my wife,"" Jerry replied, ""there ain't nothin' wrong about that.""

And technically, Jerry was right. First-cousin marriage was not illegal in the state of Mississippi (where the marriage occurred) until 2010, and to this day first-cousin-once-removed marriage is still legal under current Mississippi marriage law. Nonetheless, Judd wasn't buying it, telling Jerry that:

> ""Right an' wrong don't have anything to do with it, those people ain't gonna like it.""

Jerry was adamant, though, and insisted that:

> ""People want me, they're gonna take me no matter what.""

Jerry Lee Lewis was very wrong in this regard. As they got off the plane in London, reporters asked who the young woman was. Despite Oscar attempting to distract them, Jerry revealed that Myra was not only his wife, but fifteen, and that they had been married for two months. The only truth here was that they were married; she was actually thirteen, and it had been five months.

Myra then was asked by the press if she didn't think that fifteen was too young to marry. She replied that:

> ""Age doesn't matter back at home. You can marry at ten if you can find a husband.""

This was also true; Mississippi had no official minimum age, but since the passing of Section 93 of the Mississippi Code 1972 the state had required either parental consent if the girl was as young as 15 or - under certain conditions - a judge's approval if the girl or boy is younger; boys were prohibited from marrying before the age of 17 unless a judge allowed. In this case, Jerry - then 22 - didn't need anyone's permission but Myra's; the night of, Jerry had told J.W. that he was going to take her to see his new movie *Jamboree*. Instead, he asked her to marry him, she said yes, and they were wed the same night. 

Jerry was also fully prepared to marry her, having gotten a marriage license with the help of a female friend in Fayette the day before; there, he stated Myra was 20. 

(On top of this, during their remarriage in 1958 in Fayette, Louisiana, Jerry wrote ""None"" for the question on relation of bride to groom. Louisiana did not set a legal marriage age until 2019, and Louisiana too allows first-cousin-once-removed marriage.)

After keeping the marriage secret for a week, Jerry finally told J.W. and J.W.'s wife Lois. The two were livid to the point that J.W. threatened to skin Jerry alive and annul the marriage. Somehow, though, this did not happen.

Now, how did Jerry Lee Lewis handle the reactions from the British press and listening audience? 

By accounts, he seemed more cocky than surprised. A reporter in England asked if Jerry thought the scandal would hurt his career, to which Jerry simply said:

> ""Back in America, I got two lovely homes, three Cadillacs, and a farm. What else could anyone want?""

And when he got back to the states, he assured American reporters that the English simply did react to rock and roll like Americans did, and said that he ""got homesick."" 

He finally raised his voice when another reporter asked if he didn't think it was a bit odd for a man to marry a thirteen-year-old. 

> ""You can put this down. She's a woman.""

And when Myra was asked?

> ""I think what Jerry thinks about it.""

And by the time he and Myra had their first child - a boy named Steve - in 1959, they had bought another home. Tosches had this to say:

> ""Jerry Lee would sit by the pool in the early evening, at that hour when the sun began to fall and the darkling, sighing colors came. He would sit there and not smile and not think. It was only a matter of time, he knew, till he would once again be redeemed. He would sit there, gazing at the tame, purling water, and he would know that. And he would make a fist, wishing that there were a horse that he could knock to its fucking knees."""
AskHistorians,How comparable was Chinese westward expansion to the same phenomenon in the United States and Russia? Did the Chinese ever romanticize their western frontier in the same way the Americans romanticized theirs?,"'Chinese westward expansion' as a phenomenon is perhaps less straightforward of an idea as it may at first seem. This was not by any means a continuous process whereby bits of Inner Asia were gradually grafted onto an expanding Chinese core state, but instead can be broken down into at least four episodes, arguably six if you want to be a little more precise:

1. The westward expansion of the Han Empire, which culminated in the establishment of a relatively loose protectorate over the 'Western Regions' corresponding roughly to today's Xinjiang between 60 BCE and roughly the 130s;
2. The establishment of a similar protectorate in the 330s by the post-Han state of Liang in what is now Gansu, which lasted until the 460s when the remnants of the Liang, having evacuated to the Tarim Basin, were conquered by the Rouran;
3. The establishment of yet another protectorate by the Tang Empire in the 640s, which became essentially defunct after the outbreak of the An Lushan Rebellion in 755;
4. The Qing conquests in Inner Asia between arguably 1634 and 1758;
5. The Qing reconquest of Xinjiang between 1875 and 1878 after the region revolted in the 1860s; and
6. The annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1951.

Here I will primarily discuss the fourth and fifth events because these are the ones I know best and which also serve as the primary basis for the PRC's territorial claims.

When discussing the Qing conquests in Inner Asia we really, *really* need to discard the idea of just thinking of the Qing as a 'Chinese' state in even loose terms. Qing emperors did not see themselves merely as Chinese emperors in the mould of the Ming, but as several rulers at once: the Great Prince of the Manchus, Khagan of the Mongols, Emperor of the Chinese, and the great patron to the Tibetan priesthood. Moreover, they did not necessarily see their state as simply one in a succession of Chinese empires. If anything, there is quite a strong case to be made that the Qing, at least in the earlier period, privately saw themselves less as successors of the Chinese Ming and more as successors of the Mongol Yuan. It is often incorrectly stated that the 'Qing Dynasty' began in 1644, but that date simply marks the fall of the Ming and the Qing capture of Beijing. The Qing Empire was actually founded in 1636, a year after the Jurchens – soon renamed the Manchus – subjugated the Chakhars, whose ruler was the last holder of the Yuan seals. In the eight years following, the Qing subjugated much of what is now Inner Mongolia before the collapse of the Ming drew them into China proper, the conquest of which occupied their attention for much of the next half century.

The Ming, too, can be understood as a Mongol successor state, one that experienced great tension between acting as a continuation of the Yuan versus a repudiation of it. The ostensible 'de-Mongolification' of Chinese state and society by the Hongwu Emperor often dismantled vestigial Song structures while leaving Yuan ones largely untouched; the emperorship became considerably strengthened at the expense of the bureaucracy. And so too did the early Ming espouse both a sense of their own civilisational superiority in reaction to Mongol dominion (and earlier rule by the Jurchens and Khitans in northern China) while also entertaining ambitions of taking as much of the former Mongol realm as possible for themselves, not just limiting themselves to China proper and its ancillary territory in Liaodong. In this they succeeded only in taking over Yunnan; steppe warfare was simply not something the Ming ever really got good at. The ultimate embarrassment in this regard was the Tumu Crisis of 1449, which saw the Zhengtong Emperor captured on campaign by the Oyirads and held hostage. Too militarily inept to meaningfully challenge steppe polities, but also too proud and chauvinistic to negotiate with them on equal footing, the Ming settled for a policy of fortification, eventually stumbling into building a near-contiguous line of fortifications, now known as the Great Wall, across their northern frontier over a number of decades. Intellectual changes followed in step. It is generally accepted that most Chinese elites of the late Ming adhered to some variation on the idea that the more modest size of the Ming was in fact a good thing – that it was ordained by the impersonal forces of the heavens that the 'civilised' and 'barbarian' realms were to be kept separate.

These narrative threads collided in the 1640s as the Manchu Qing, aspiring perhaps towards recreating as much as they could of the old Mongol empire, came to rule a people whose political class had not only long abandoned such ambitions, but had also broadly come to regard them as morally incorrect. This would prove somewhat of a quandary when the Qing ended up in a protracted rivalry with the Zunghars, a tribe of the Oyirads that had gained dominance in western Mongolia after the collapse of their parent confederation. The first (and technically last) Zunghar khan, Galdan, attacked the Khalkha tribes in 1688; this led to the Khalkha seeking Qing protection, and the Qing launching a series of campaigns that finally resulted in Galdan being assassinated by one of his officers in 1697. These campaigns were predominantly handled by the Manchus and their Mongol allies, with very limited Han Chinese involvement.

Han Chinese military officers and personnel would come to take on a larger role during the eighteenth century, though not a dominant one. Han troops would be involved in the conquest of Tibet in 1720, in a counterattack against the Zunghars' subjugation of the Khoshut Mongols, Tibet's previous suzerains, in 1718. The Yongzheng Emperor, who came to the throne in 1721, came to rely heavily on two Han Chinese generals, Nian Gengyao and Yue Zhongqi, who generally advocated for a cautious policy in the west but who were willing to follow their instructions to the letter when the emperor called for aggression. Evidence of involvement is not evidence of ideology, however. In any event this period was short-lived: Nian would be executed in 1726 on accusations of corruption and treason, accusations supported by Yue Zhongqi, who was himself dramatically sidelined in 1733 as a somewhat overdue reaction to the 1727 Zeng Jing scandal, only to be rehabilitated after the Qianlong Emperor acceded to the throne in 1735.

A digression into the Zeng Jing affair is warranted as it gets across how differing ideas of empire clashed at this stage. Zeng, a failed scholar from Hunan influenced by the privately – but widely – circulated writings of the Ming loyalist writer Lü Liuliang (1629-1683), had petitioned Yue Zhongqi to revolt against the Qing, appealing to his ancestry (Yue was a descendant of Yue Fei, who had fought for the Song against the Jurchens and thus came to symbolise opposition to foreign conquerors). Zeng was tracked down and arrested, but instead of immediately being executed for treason, he ended up in an exchange of letters with the Yongzheng Emperor, which was edited and published into a volume called the *Dayi juemi lu* ('Discourse on Great Righteousness to Resolve Confusion'), and he himself would be pardoned. Zeng's argument, deriving from Lü's, was fundamentally of a racialist character: he argued that the correct interpretation of the Confucian canon entailed the belief that 'civilised' or 'barbarian' status was a matter of birth, and that these realms were supposed to be separate. The emperor's response was to employ the 'culturalist' interpretation of the canon: actually, 'barbarian' rulers could be legitimate, because 'civilisation' could spread and those of 'barbarian' birth could become 'civilised' themselves, and thus become entitled to rule. It is worth noting that he does not necessarily mean that 'civilisation' entailed the broad adoption of Chinese cultural practices; he instead referred in relatively general terms to the idea of absorbing the Confucian code of ethics, acting with 'virtue' (*de*) and maintaining the proper relationship between ruler and subject. While these arguments primarily addressed Qing rule in China, they could be, and were, extrapolated out to the Qing imperial project: *should* China share territory with peoples who were not historically part of the Chinese realm? In the racialist mode, no: let them wallow in their barbarousness. In the culturalist mode, perhaps: to paraphrase Peter Perdue, the Yongzheng Emperor wrote of the Qing's Great Unity and its allegiance from peoples 'both inner and outer'. The argument was not simply one in favour of Qing rule in China, it was one that could be deployed to justify Qing rule *anywhere*.

Whether the Yongzheng Emperor was *successful* in this endeavour is a somewhat different matter. It's not clear that he necessarily convinced many people in the Chinese literati, and one person he definitely failed to convince was his own son, among whose first acts on his accession was to declare the *Dayi juemi lu* to have outlived its usefulness, burning any copies he could get his hands on and having Zeng Jing executed for good measure. The Qianlong Emperor would complete the Qing Empire's western conquests in 1758, overseeing first the genocide of the Zunghars after the revolt of his former client ruler Amursana in 1757, and then the subjugation of the cities of the Tarim Basin. This was not the last Qing conquest under his rule: Lesser Jinchuan, a region in the Tibetan-Sichuan borderlands, was theoretically in Qing territory but functionally completely autonomous; it would be brought to heel in 1771-6. These wars were the subject of enormous commemorative efforts, which Joanna Waley-Cohen argues to have been motivated by a desire to both shore up Manchu martial vigour and also to inculcate that same sense of martial qualities among the Han Chinese, whom the Qianlong Emperor may have perceived as too 'soft' in temperament to have supported those campaigns."

AskHistorians,Was Spain really “like a mouth” that took in the riches of the Americas and immediately passed them on to other European powers?,"The Spanish Crown was in colossal debt since the reign of Charles V, when His Holy Catholic Caesarean Royal Majesty was constantly involved in wars, which cost an insane amount of money.

His first major loan was contracted with Jakob Fugger the Rich, for the sum of 300,000 ducats in order to get himself crowned Holy Roman Emperor. That was a very large sum of money, but he had to bribe the princes-electors in order to be chosen as Emperor, and the princes take no small bribes.

Then came the wars with the Lutheran princes in Germany, the wars with the Turks throughout the whole Mediterranean and in Europe (the Ottomans laid siege to Vienna), the Italian wars against the king of France, and even some insurrections in Spain (Comunidades and Germanías). That makes for a very hefty bill, which left the Crown in constant debt.

Then came his son Philip II of Spain, who was a war just about his whole reign against England, France, the rebellious Dutch provinces, or any combination of those, plus the wars in the Mediterranean against the Ottomans. The war with the Dutch provinces was by far the longest and costliest, spanning all the way to the reign of his grandson Philip IV.

Philip III and Philip IV also had to fight the French, the Dutch, the English, the Barbary pirates, and occasionally the Ottomans. At one point, Philip IV saw war everywhere: the Portuguese war of Independence, the Catalan insurrection, uprisings in Naples and Sicily, the eternal war with the Dutch.

In the end, Francisco de Quevedo put the cash situation quite succintly in a poem called ""Don Dinero"", where he says about gold: Nace en las Indias honrado / donde el mundo le acompaña / viene a morir en España/ y es en Génova enterrado. (He is born honoured in the Indies / where the world is with him / he comes to Spain to die / and in Genoa he is buried).

Besides the Fuggers and the Welsers, the Spanish crown was in colossal debt to Genoan bankers, who usually set very high interest rates due to the very serious risk of the debts going unpaid."

AskHistorians,What kind of person built a Sears mail order house?,">Was it an average Joe who figured, “how hard can this be?” and built it themselves? Or was it a skilled laborer who had a pretty good idea of how to build a house and just needed the stuff? Or was it a mom and pop construction company that bought pre-constructed houses to save time/money?

All of the above.

Mail-order homes of the kit variety were a 20th century phenomenon;
while there are instances of pre-fab homes through the 19th century,
this is more like a genuine IKEA set, with every single part down
to the nails given separately. Sears was only one of multiple companies
that offered kits. The first, Aladdin, started selling in 1906.

The typical (although not only) model was to stagger out shipments. The idea was you'd assemble
the first set, then be ready by the time the second set arrived. So you'd
start with lumber and frames and by the time the last shipment came you'd
get the laundry tub and any fine woodwork.

Materials arrived by train. In the very early days, horses and carts were then used to take the materials to the site.

There are certainly plenty of testimonials of ""ordinary people"" who just decided to go for it. One letter in the book _Houses by Mail_ on a 1928 house specifies:

>My dad did the carpentry and subcontracted the masonry, electrical, and plumbing work.

George E. Aller in 1913 decided to add a house to his farm and he wrote letters to his wife giving his progress:

>April: Dug the post holes

>July: Have the cellar done

>August: All sided up, window frames in and painted

>September: All the carpenter work done

Other letters (from the time or from testimonials later) indicate the use of carpenters or contractors. The entire
mail-order enterprise was in fact contentious for local workers, who were having jobs taken away. There were
full-page ads from trade unions claiming the manufacturing quality of mail order homes were inferior, and
a April 1928 ad from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters put out an ad demanding that union carpenters do the
building of the kit homes.

The other element that made people go with one of the kit homes is loans: Sears was their own mortgage lender and offered fairly generous terms. They even started to cover the labor itself (assuming you were paying people to do the assembly, not uncommon) as part of the mortgages. (This did lead to some negative publicity for Sears during the Great Depression, as they ended up having to foreclose on a great many of their own kit houses.)

There are also letters from people who were experienced home-builders who ordered the mail-order homes to save on cost. However, the most elaborate ""professional purchase"" I know of is from the Austin Motor car factory in England.

This was at the end of 1916, during World War 1. The services of Austin were heavily in demand, and the plant in Longbridge was growing exponentially -- it went from 2000 at the start of WW1 to 20,000 by the end. Most of the workers were women, and there were an enormous number of buses needed to bring all the labor that was needed.

The owner, Lord Hebert Austin, decided to make an entire village. In order to make this happen quickly, he went with
Aladdin (who, recall, were the very first house kit company). 200 kits were ordered in December of 1916 for $115,000. The 200 houses were then assembled over a year, and the houses
held an average of 7 people (for the smaller houses) or 12 (for the larger ones). You can [still visit the Austin Village](https://www.theaustinvillage.com/visit) today and some of those kit houses.

I think most people still associate the kit houses with an old-timey, early-20th century phenomenon, but they lasted longer than you might think; Aladdin lasted all the way to 1981. [Here is one of their catalogs from 1963](https://archive.org/details/AladdinReadiCutHomes/page/n1/mode/2up). On the back testimonial page, a Mr. Alto from West Virginia is quoted as saying:

>May I add, if any one can follow written instructions, they can build an Aladdin House.

I have a YouTube channel called [We Have Always Existed](https://www.youtube.com/@TransgenderAncientHistory) \- it's a show about the variety of transgender histories we can find in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. The Romans and earlier, essentially.

I've posted a few videos, but one of my favourite stories is the *enarei*, the transgender priestesses of the Scythians. It's on my channel, but in the interest of doing more than just shameless self promotion, there's a primer below.

**Who Were The Scythians?**

The Scythians lived in a region today known as the Great Steppe. It's a swath of grassland stretching from modern Bulgaria to the Pacific coast of China. If you're familiar with Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire, this is where they first started, though that was about a thousand years later.

Like the Khans, the Scythians did a lot of horseback riding. It plays a big role in their art.

The Scythians were an illiterate culture. As a result, we know the most about the ones who lived near the Black Sea, because the Greeks wrote about them.

**Sources On The Scythians**

We have three ancient sources of interest from a transgender perspective - Herodotus, Pseudo-Hippocrates, and Ovid. 

***Herodotus*** needs no introduction in this subreddit. He traveled a lot while writing his *Histories*, in the 5th century BCE, including mainland Greece, Persia, Egypt, Babylon, and of course, Scythia, where he writes about them.

***Pseudo-Hippocrates***, on the other hand, we know almost nothing about. We have a collection of writings on ancient medicine called the Hippocratic Corpus. It’s based on the teachings of Hippocrates. We don’t think Hippocrates wrote any of it, and it was likely written by more than one person. But we don’t really know any of their names, so we just say the whole thing was written by Pseudo-Hippocrates. One of the writings is called ***On Airs, Waters, And Places***, where the author talks about the Scythians as though he'd been there. It dates to the 5th or 4th centuries BCE.

***Ovid***, on the other hand, lived in the 1st century CE. He lived in Rome, and was one of the great poets of the Augustan era. But at some point, he did something to upset Augustus so badly that he was kicked out of the empire altogether. The empire was most of the known civilized world at the time, so Ovid settled in Tomis on the coast of the Black Sea, where he wrote the ***Amores,*** among other things. 

**The Enarei**

Both Pseudo-Hippocrates and Herodotus talk about a group within Scythian society which they referred to as the *enarei* (singular enaree). We don't know what they called themselves, but this is a Greek word that essentially means ""effeminates"".

In chapter 22 of On ***Airs, Waters, And Places***, Pseudo-Hippocrates tells us:

> And, in addition to these, there are many eunuchs among the Scythians, who perform female work, and speak like women. Such persons are called ***enarei***. The inhabitants of the country attribute the cause of their impotence to a god, and venerate and worship such persons, every one dreading that the like might befall himself...They put on female attire, reproach themselves for effeminacy, play the part of women, and perform the same work as women do.

These were, it seems, assigned male at birth. They play a woman's role in society, speak like women, and are described as eunuchs.

We also know Scythian women often served as horseback archers, so when Pseudo-Hippocrates says they play a woman's role, we're not sure if he means from his perspective - that they were homemakers, took care of children, etc - or from a Scythian perspective. But based on what else is described about them, it seems like the former. 

Herodotus, on the other hand, tells us more about the spiritual role of the enarei.

>“There are among the Scythians many diviners, who divine by means of many willow wands as I will show. They bring great bundles of wands, which they lay on the ground and unfasten, and utter their divinations laying one rod on another; and while they yet speak they gather up the rods once more and lay them one by one; this manner of divination is hereditary among them. The enarei, who are androgynous, say that Aphrodite gave them the art of divination, which they practice by means of lime-tree bark. They cut this bark into three portions, and prophesy while they plait and unplait these in their fingers.” 

– ***Histories****,* Book 4, Chapter 67

Earlier, he provides us with a mythological reason for why he thinks this was the case.

>When the Scythians came on their way to the city of Ascalon in Syria, most of them passed by and did no harm, but a few remained behind and plundered the temple of Heavenly Aphrodite…and all their descendants after them, were afflicted by the goddess with the female sickness, and so the Scythians say that they are afflicted as a consequence of this.

\- ***Histories***, Book 1, chapter 105

So, let's take a look at we've gotten so far.

We're told the *enarei* were assigned male at birth, as are all eunuchs by definition.

We're told they appeared feminine, which may suggest that they were castrated at a young age, before puberty. The fact that they sounded like women is further evidence.

We're told they played a woman’s role in society.

We also know at least one of the unique roles they played in Scythian society. When the king was ill, he would call upon the three most respected *enarei* in the community to use their divining skills to figure out what was cursing him. 

Assumingly they had other roles as well, since the king probably wasn't sick every day. But we don't know the specifics. However, this seems important, so they must have been respected in Scythian society.

AskHistorians,"Every time I mention Ronald Reagan to my father, he says that he ""arguably won the Cold War"". Was Reagan's presidency an important factor in ending the Could War?","It depends. First I'll tackle the myth, which is pretty persistent, namely that Reagan's military spending (or sometimes strictly that related to the Strategic Defense Initiative aka ""Star Wars"") bankrupted the USSR and ended the Cold War. A repost of an old [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8cnm73/comment/dxgq0lh/) of mine:

**Part I**

The short answer is that while the Soviet Union did collapse in no small part because of budget deficits and economic stability, and while SDI did play a complicated role in arms control negotiations towards the end of the Cold War, responses to SDI were not a major factor in either the collapse of the Soviet Union, nor in the end of the Cold War.

First, about the Strategic Defense Initiative.  SDI, simply, was a defense program that was supposed to render nuclear weapons obsolete by creating a system of anti-ballistic missiles (or lasers) that would be able to intercept any Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles with nuclear warheads fired at the United States or its allies. The first call for such a program was in President Reagan’s “Address to the Nation on Defense and National Security”, [given]( https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1983/32383d.htm) on March 23, 1983:

>”What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?
I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century. Yet, current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort. It will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs. And as we proceed, we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response. But isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war? We know it is.”

Now, while this was a momentous announcement, it is largely a concluding section to a larger speech, one that effectively is given to justify increased US military spending since Reagan came to office in 1981. The general thrust of the speech was: “the Soviets have increased their military spending and research since the 1970s, the US has fallen behind, and needs to spend more to catch up.” Small note: while it has been argued, with some documentary evidence from Reagan’s diary, that the film “The Day After” had a profound influence on his desire to eliminate the nuclear threat, that made-for-TV film was broadcast in November 1983, some eight months after this national address.

Congress [appropriated]( https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/12/us/cost-of-missile-defense-put-at-70-billion-by-1993.html) $1.39 billion for the initiative in 1984, but this was largely for research. The project was considered to have a final cost of $70 billion, soon [rising]( http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-12/news/mn-7383_1_star-wars) to $170 billion, with no operational defense before 2000. Ultimately SDI was renamed in 1993, and then reorganized again in 2002 as the Missile Defense Agency. While it continues to conduct anti-ballistic missile research, the results have been mixed, and to date there is no ballistic missile shield rendering nuclear weapons obsolete.

So, so much for SDI. Now let’s look at the Soviet response to the program. The impact that the announcement of SDI had on Soviet strategic thinking has been debated. First, it’s worth noting that the Soviet defense industry and the Politburo *did* plan responses to SDI:

>A decision of the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of 15 July 1985 approved a number of ""long-term research and development programs aimed at exploring the ways to create a multi-layered defense system with ground-based and space-based elements."" It should be noted that no commitment to deployment of any of these systems was made at the time. The goal of the research and development effort was ""to create by 1995 a technical and technological base in case the deployment of a multi-layered missile defense system would be necessary.""

These “symmetric” defense responses largely revolved around developing a ground-based missile defense, and a space-based defense. However, it’s also important to note that the Soviet ministries proposing these measures were largely repackaging projects that they already had on the books, rather than creating entirely new systems from scratch, and that in any case no development to the point of deployment was considered for at least a decade. Furthermore, Soviet ministries involved in defense projects were confident in developing “asymmetric” responses to SDI (ie, mechanisms for allowing ICBMs to bypass SDI defenses). 

Ultimately, as stated by Pavel Podvig, an independent analyst on Soviet and Russian nuclear forces:

>”The new evidence on the Soviet response to SDI largely corroborates the prevailing view that the Soviet Union eventually realized that this program does not present a danger to its security, for it could be relatively easily countered with simple and effective countermeasures. The evidence also helps answer some important questions about the concerns that the Soviet Union had about the U.S. program, the reasoning behind the choices that the Soviet leadership made, and the process that led to those choices.

So SDI does not seem to have greatly altered Soviet military spending. 

Which is not to say that the Soviet government did not care about SDI! The key difference is that it is not that SDI caused a new round of massive military spending, but that there was the fear that it and similar programs might at a time when Gorbachev was already committed to lowering defense expenditures. It clearly was a major item in arms control negotiations between the US and Soviet Union, most notably in the Reykjavik Summit in October of 1986: Gorbachev offered massive reductions in nuclear weapons if Reagan would agree to scrap deployment of (the then-nonexistent) SDI. Reagan refused, but offered to share the technology with the Soviet Union, which Gorbachev was suspicious about (“You don’t even want to share petroleum equipment, automatic machine tools, or equipment for dairies, while sharing SDI would be a second American revolution.”). The end result was that both parties walked away without any agreement. As Reagan noted: “Gorbachev is adamant we must cave in our SDI – well, this will be a case of an irresistible force meeting an immovable object.”

SDI played a major role in US-Soviet arms control negotiations in the 1980s, but it was more of a complicating factor, rather than a decisive factor – if anything it made coming to a comprehensive arms control agreement more difficult. 

Now, I’d like to turn to the Soviet economy and its role in the Soviet collapse."
AskHistorians,Did Greeks and Romans drink wine to excess nearly as often as people do in modern drinking cultures?,"> ""Drunkenness is harmful to mankind; and neither would I myself agree, if I could help it, to an excess of drinking, nor would I recommend it to another - especially when his head is still heavy from a bout the day before.""

-- Plato, *Symposion* 176d

The ancient Greeks - or more specifically, ancient Greek men who could afford it - drank a lot. They knew all about the bad effects of alcohol, but they still regularly participated in the ritualised drinking parties called *symposia*, which were so central to (elite) men's lives that they designed and built their houses to accommodate them. At these parties, friends would gather and recline on couches, and they would pass around flat drinking vessels ([the *kylix*](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1952-0204-24)) which were filled from a large mixing bowl ([the *krater*](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1772-0320-1-)) in which the mixture of wine and water (and sometimes honey) was prepared and kept cool. The men would take turns making a toast, performing a song, making a speech, or reciting some poetry, and were then expected to empty their *kylix*. Many rounds of this, emptying *krater* after *krater*, would inevitably get the participants plastered.

> ""For sensible men I prepare only three kraters: one for health (which they drink first), the second for love and pleasure, and the third for sleep. After the third one is drained, wise men go home. The fourth krater is not mine any more - it belongs to boastfulness; the fifth is for shouting; the sixth is for rudeness and insults; the seventh is for fights; the eighth is for breaking the furniture; the ninth is for depression; the tenth is for madness and unconsciousness.""

-- Euboulos fragment 93 Kassel-Austin (a surviving fragment from a lost comedy)

Knowing exactly where excessive drinking would lead, many Greeks urged moderation. Various sources urge revellers to add more water when they mix the wine, to serve fewer kraters, and to go home while they're still steady on their feet. The Spartans, who were required by law to drink with their messmates every night, supposedly had a rule that those who were going home after these drinking parties were not allowed to take a torch; it was hoped that this would encourage them to leave while they were still sober enough to find their way home in the dark. Several anecdotes also tell of how the Spartans would force their helots to drink wine and perform embarrasing acts to show young Spartan men how undignified it was to be drunk.

But the passage from Plato that I quoted earlier shows the tension between the ideal of moderation and the reality of drinking culture. Rationally, everyone knows drinking is bad for your health. But we still do it, largely because it is a social activity. Among friends it is easy to go along with the fun, and knowing when to stop was as hard then as it is now. In fact, these ritualised drinking parties (which were also furnished with other forms of entertainment, including music, performances, debates, drinking games, and sex) were a very important part of social and political life, in which deals and alliances were made, ties affirmed, political schemes hatched, and so on. It was important to be part of the piss-up. Wine was the lubrication of the old boys network. It was a dreadful thing to be known, like the orator Demosthenes, as a ""water-drinker"" - someone too dull and austere to participate in alcohol-fuelled funtimes.

The reality, then, was that Greek men, for all their talk of moderation, regularly got very drunk. They mocked themselves for it by putting images in the bottom of their *kylikes* of [people throwing up](https://peoplingthepastcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/cj-intro-blog_fig.-5.jpg?w=855); the image would only become visible once the drinker had emptied the bowl (it was a [common theme](https://i0.wp.com/s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a0/66/97/a06697e93cca1be03936a5201f7d91bb.jpg?resize=586%2C579&ssl=1) to depict a woman or child holding the hair out of the vomiting man's eyes). Infamously, their drinking parties would often spill out into the street, when revellers would form a *komos* - a mock procession, somewhere between a mob and a conga line - and wander around the town or crash other drinking parties. These roving gangs of drunk men were prone to getting themselves in trouble, as another fragment of a lost comedy by Epicharmos confirms:

> A sacrifice leads to a feast, and a feast leads to drinking. But drinking leads to wandering the streets drunk, and a *komos* leads to swinish behaviour, and acting swinishly leads to a lawsuit, [and a lawsuit leads to being found guilty], and being found guilty leads to shackles, stocks, and a fine.

Even philosophers who use a *symposion* as a setting for philosophical debates accepted the reality that such parties and debates could be suddenly interrupted when a *komos* from another drinking party invaded and derailed the proceedings. Plato's *Symposion* (223b) ends in this way:

> So Agathon was getting up in order to seat himself by Sokrates, when suddenly a great crowd of revellers arrived at the door, which they found just opened for someone who was going out. They marched straight into the party and seated themselves; the whole place was in an uproar and, losing all order, they were forced to drink a vast amount of wine.

So, in short, yes: despite their ideals and their habit of drinking wine mixed with water, Greek men still drank too much, and indeed shared a whole culture of excessive drinking, with its own rituals and expectations. The participants in Plato's *Symposion* set up their drinking party while complaining about their hangover from the last one. Whether this was the same across all social classes is much harder to answer, since our sources focus so much on the wealthy. However, at least in Athens, it seems that *symposia* were ""democratised"" somewhere around 500 BC, spreading from the social elite to a much wider section of the population. It seems very likely that anyone who could afford it - using cheaper wine served from cheaper pottery - tried to imitate the lifestyles of the rich. Meanwhile, there are also some hints that women may have organised their own gatherings while the men were busy at their *symposia*, and may well have imitated their habits too; certainly Plato suggests that any entertainers who were no longer of interest to the company of men could be sent to the women's quarters to provide their services there. The same rule would apply in those circles: the ideal was moderation, but the reality was that the wine flowed when the mood was high."
AskHistorians,"Modern jokes aside, what’s the latest known instance of English people (presumably nobility and/or military) still being sincerely sore about the loss of the 13 colonies?",[removed]
AskHistorians,Why were medieval armies so much smaller than classical armies?,"The disparity between Medieval army size and Classical/Antique army size really is down to one major thing, state capacity, and I'm sorry if that's not an answer that you find compelling or sufficient, but it really does boil down to the nuts and bolts of military planning and supply, or logistics.  

The medieval world was filled with states that were just simply not able to muster the same amount of men under arms because of the constraints that medieval armies and societies faced compared to Roman, Hellenistic, and other Classical world states because they lacked the administrative capacity, the levels of urbanization, and coercive political systems that the states of Antiquity enjoyed.  However this level of uneven army size is mostly applicable to western Medieval Europe, nor was it constant.  

Let's start with the basics, as the Western Roman Empire disintegrated over time its institutions and bureaucracy likewise collapsed.  The ability of the Post-Roman ""Barbarians"" to maintain Roman systems such as the large standing army (which was already much smaller than its heyday some centuries before), large urban centers, and efficient (relatively) tax collection was extremely limited.  The collapse of long distance trade, the Roman bureaucracy, and the diminished ability of post-Roman, and even post-Carolingian states to effectively administer their territories, meant that actually getting tens of thousands of individuals into a single army was a logistical nightmare.  Likewise, the same reduction of capacity in logistics and administration meant that the ability of Medieval governments to *pay* and *feed* such large hosts would have been doubtful at best.  The Romans did not have these same limitations, by being able to call upon the vast tax revenue of the empire, and requisition supplies from all around the Mediterranean, the Roman army could put together, and sustain (and this is the really important part) large armies on a permanent basis.  

I'll just link /u/Celebreth's excellent answer on Roman logistics so that you can get a sense of just how large and involved the Roman logistical machine was.

After all as you note, other polities such as the Britons and Gauls were able to raise very large hosts as well, and they too lacked the Roman penchant for logistical organization.  Now we can chalk some of the huge number of men under arms in Germanic, Gallic, and so on army sizes to the hyperbole of ancient authors, but even taking this into account it does appear to be the case that even less urbanized and bureaucratic states were able to leverage a larger amount of their population into soldiers.  The major difference here is going to be that Medieval states had additional layers of what I will call fractured authority.  

The king of France in the year 1000 was theoretically in charge of all of France as one would assume, however, his practical power extended a few tens of kilometers around the city of Paris and that was about it.  The lords of Normandy, Southern France, Aquitaine, and more functioned essentially as independent figures, and the idea that the king could exert effective coercive power over their economies, military, logistical networks, and the like was laughable.  This was the case in much of Western Europe.  As Roman social organization, urbanization, and the like broke down, local powers, what we might place as the ""nobles"" of the ""Feudal system"" stepped in, however these lords came with their own interests, quarrels, and power bases which precluded most post-Roman Western European states from exerting effective control fully over their own nominal territory.  Throw into that mix the utter lack of maintained infrastructure like roads, supply depots, and all the other things that make huge armies possible, and you've got a series of issues that were plaguing any would be large Medieval army from the outset.

This was also heightened by other factors as well.  The Medieval World's armies were not like those of the Roman or Hellenistic worlds.  Most Medieval armies were not made up of, contrary to popular depictions, of rabbles of peasants given a little training and sent off to fight.  By the time of the High Middle Ages, around the year 1000 or so, the Medieval armies of groups like the Normans, Anglo-Saxons, Byzantines, Italian States, and so on were rather professionalized.  By the time of the 100 Years War in France, the armies of France and England were thoroughly professionalized that drew on large pools of mercenaries, wealthy urban dwellers, and other manpower pools.  So why weren't these armies the same size as armies of Antiquity?  The answer is rather simple really, cost.  The armies of the Middle Ages were relatively more expensive to the states that fielded them than the Roman Empire's armies.  Given the vast logistical network of the Roman army and the incredible financial resources the Roman state could rely upon the small size of Medieval armies makes a lot more sense.  Now throw into that other elements, the much more expensive demands on individuals for Medieval soldiers for their equipment (Medieval Europe lacked the capacity to provide uniform equipment, including weapons and armor to their soldiers), the reduced ability of the state to adequately fund large armies over a long period of time, and again the answer becomes rather clear, it is all down to state capacity and logistics.

Despite these limitations, there were still states that were able to assemble large armies from time to time.  The English under the Anglo-Saxons maintained a system called the *fyrd* that could be called up as essentially a mass levy to fight off attackers, but the state still lacked the capacity to *maintain* them as a standing force, and even when called up they could only be fielded for a certain amount of time, they would eat themselves to death otherwise.  Now in some cases, such as in the Byzantine Empire, the various Islamic states, or during the Crusades much larger hosts were assembled, Thomas Asbridge for example estimates the strength of the First Crusade at over 100,000 people (many of whome were not combatants, knights, soldiers, or fighters really) when all is said and done, but they were not one cohesive army, they couldn't be really.  The logistical nightmares facing Medieval armies really come home in looking at the First Crusade. It was to be frank an embarrassing display of Western Military competence at the time.

Because if its disparate and disorganized nature the crusaders were barely able to keep their army together, and indeed at times utterly failed to do so!  The followers of Peter the Hermit for example were nearly all killed or enslaved when they arrived in the Holy Land too early, much of the Eastern European countryside was subjected to looting by the crusading forces, they consistently ran out of food, and were such a shambles at time that it is honestly a miracle they managed to seize Jerusalem at all.  Their armies often fought divided, bickered over how to conduct sieges, arrived at different staging points at different times, and all of this was probably still the best that they could actually manage to do.  

Keeping large armies fed and cohesive has been a challenge in all states that field armies, and there are always draw backs to different approaches.  In the Middle Ages, the collapse of state authority compounded these problems, and it was only later on in the Middle Ages as state capacity rebuilt itself through renewed urbanization, the creation of a new bureaucracy, and the gradual consolidation of power in royal figures that army sizes started to consistently approach the sizes of Roman armies at the empire's height."

AskHistorians,"In the Quran, Mohammed's family are referred to as ""Hanifs"" - members of a sect of monotheists, who were neither Jewish nor Christian. What were the beliefs of these Hanifs, and how were they different from Jews and Christians?","Great question, one for which we do not have a certain answer! So instead I'll tell you some interesting information which may point to an answer. The word *hanif* in Arabic is related to a word *hanpa*/*hanfa* in Syriac, which was a (predominantly Christian) dialect of Aramaic (i.e., the language Jesus spoke) and the lingua franca of the Near and Middle East until probably 1000AD or so. Syriac-speaking peoples have long had contact with Arabs, including before the Islamic period, and their texts give us some of the best insights into early Islam. (See, for instance, Michael Penn, *When Christians First Met Muslims*, but there are a ton of books on this.) 

So this should solve the problem, right? We just need to see what this means in Syriac. Well, it turns out to be more complicated, because in fact the word *hanpa* is curiously the Syriac word for pagan! How did a term of opprobrium in Syriac become a positive word for the monotheistic qualities of Christians and Jews? *Hanpa* and consequently *hanif* must have had a broader semantic range (range of meaning) than simply ""pagan."" Rather, in Syriac it probably encompassed the sense of Gentile -- that is, a non-Jew, but of course the term Gentile acquires a more positive meaning in Christianity, since Jesus commands his followers to make disciples not only of the Jews but of the Gentiles. 

So what does this word mean in the Qur'an? Pagan? Gentile? In fact, it seems to take on a new meaning, meaning something like a ""righteous, Abrahamic monotheist."" Abraham is the paradigmatic *hanif*. Q2:135 is very clear about this: ""The Jews and Christians each say, 'Follow our faith to be rightly guided.' Say, O Prophet, 'No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the *hanif*...'"" So *hanif* does not only mean a kind of pre-Abrahamic devotion to God (which elsewhere in the Qur'an is referred to as the paradigmatic *islam,* that is, submission) -- *hanif* is also an integral part of the Qur'an's polemics against Christianity and Judaism, to the effect that those groups have fought each other and corrupted their sacred texts so that what they believe is no longer the pure monotheism and submission of Abraham, but something much different and decidedly less good.

AskHistorians,"Two maxims inscribed in the Temple of Apollo at Delphi are famous — ""Know Thyself,"" and ""Nothing in Excess"". But the third is rarely mentioned and opaque — ""A Pledge Brings Trouble."" Do we know what was behind this third cryptic maxim, and why the Greeks thought it was important?","For reference, the phrasing in Greek is ἐγγύα, πάρα δ' ἄτα. There's some wiggle room in the translation, since πάρα could be either adverbial or a poetic postposition. Most renditions treat it as an adverb, with a comma after ἐγγύα. It doesn't change the translation hugely -- 'a surety, followed by disaster' or something similar.

Do we know what's behind it? Kind of yes, kind of no. It isn't nearly as widely attested as the other two proverbs, which are supposed to have been present on a column at Delphi. But it does appear in enough places to think it's a traditional maxim in a similar vein. We don't know the specifics of its original context, but we know the general generic context in which that maxim and others like it appeared.

These proverbs are sometimes ascribed to one or other of the Seven Sages, a traditional canon of seven early philosophers. For your maxim, the usual ascription is to Thales of Miletos. An anonymous poem in the *Palatine anthology*, summing up aphorisms from all the 'seven sages', includes all three of them in slightly modified forms (*Anth. Pal*. 9.366) --

> Of the seven sages I declare their cities, names, and sayings.  
Kleoboulos of Lindos said 'measure is best' (μέτρον ... ἄριστον);  
Chilon [*sic*] in hollow Lakedaimon said, 'know yourself' (γνῶθι σεαυτόν).  
Periandros, who lived in Corinth, said, 'control anger' (χόλου κρατέειν).  
Pittakos, 'nothing to excess' (οὐδὲν ἄγαν), who was from Mytilene by race.  
'Look to the end of life' (τέρμα ... ὁρᾷν βιότοιο), Solon in holy Athens.  
'Most men are evil' (τοὺς πλέονας κακίους), Bias of Priene declared.  
**'Avoid suretyship' (ἐγγύην φεύγειν),** spoke Thales of Miletos.

Stobaios 3.1.172 lists several maxims for each of the Seven Sages, including all of the above, in more standard forms:

* Kleoboulos of Lindos: 'measure is best' (μέτρον ἄριστον), 'one must always honour one's father' (πατέρα δεῖ αἰδεῖσθαι), 'keep a healthy body and a healthy mind' (εὖ τὸ σῶμα ἔχειν καὶ τὴν ψυχήν), and many more.
* Solon of Athens: 'nothing to excess' (μηδὲν ἄγαν), 'don't sit down as judge' (κρίτης μὴ κάθησο), etc.
* Cheilon of Lakedaimon: 'know yourself' (γνῶθι σαυτόν), etc.
* Thales of Miletos: 'a surety, followed by disaster' (ἐγγύα, πάρα δ' ἄτα), etc.
* Pittakos of Lesbos: 'know the right moment' (καιρὸν γνῶθι), etc.
* Bias of Priene: 'most men are evil' (οἱ πλεῖστοι ἄνθρωποι κακοί), etc.
* Periandros of Corinth: 'look after the whole' (μελέτα τὸ πᾶν), etc.

A few other references attribute your maxim to Pittakos or Bias instead. The ascription is at best doubtful, because Thales doesn't seem to have left any written works -- there's some reason to think books didn't start to written down until after his lifetime -- and a lot of the material attributed to him seems to have been transmitted by Anaximander, a somewhat later Milesian philosopher.

But there's no doubt it was a traditional maxim, and that all three aphorisms are linked to famous sages, and they all appear intermittently as quotations or allusions in various poets from the 400s BCE onwards.

The sense of the aphorism doesn't strike me as all that obscure: the idea seems to be simply, 'if you offer a surety, you're going to get into trouble when you have to put your money where your mouth is'. If you compare the other aphorisms above, most of them don't really come across as statements that are meant to apply to all aspects of life. They're pithy statements which work better in some situations, not so well in others. They're best compared to biblical proverbs, which were another manifestation of the same literary genre -- 'wisdom poetry', where the speaker addresses a named individual and offers them advice and pithy proverbs, was a standard genre throughout the early Near East, and became popular in Greece too: its best known early proponents were the Hesiodic *Works and days*, Theognis, and figures like Solon (one of the Seven Sages). A maxim like this is best thought of in that context, rather than as an embodiment of Greek culture or anything like that.

A hundred years ago Eliza G. Wilkins, at Hood College, Maryland, wrote a series of articles on the Delphic maxims. The relevant article for this maxim is:

* Wilkins, E. G. 1927. 'ἐγγύα, πάρα δἄτη in literature.' *Classical philology* 22.2: 121-135. [[JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/263511)]

She gives a copious supply of references, cross-references, and contexts for this maxim and its various appearances. She also discusses a range of alternate interpretations, which revolve a bit more around transcendental philosophy than the more practical advice I take it as. Her work hasn't been superceded as far as I can see, and for a 1920s article it's first-rate work. The only thing she misses is the wisdom literature angle (of course Near Eastern wisdom literature was still poorly known at that time)."

AskHistorians,Why are turkey legs at Renaissance fairs?,"The ""visionary founder"" of the Renaissance faire is Phyllis Patterson, and I need to do a little lead-up history, because
it's relevant to the question.

Patterson's first job after graduating high school (1949) was hosting a TV show called _Phyl's Playhouse_ reading
stories and poetry, which ran as a Saturday broadcast while she went to Memphis State College. She got friends
from college to be the ""acts"". The educational aspect made her determined to focus on learning through the arts, and
after moving to LA she started teaching high school English. In 1960 her first child was born, and she looked upon
a new job that would allow her more flexible time to take care of her child. She found a job at a youth
program (""Wonderland Youth Center"") teaching drama to children.

She was, remember, a high school teacher, and had not thought to ask about the age ranges of children, so was surprised
when she found out there were 80 children from ""six to thirteen"".

(This has to do with the turkey legs, I promise.)

To manage the class she decided to use portions of historical plays, and divided the children into fairly small groups,
everything from ""caveman"" costumes for early storytellers on up. What ended up being remarkably popular was
the commedia dell'arte.

This was a form of theater during the Italian Renaissance with ""stock characters"", but importantly for the children,
involved improvisation, acrobatics, and loud noises. As they were in a film industry area (LA, remember,) there ended
up being enough connections with parents to put out an elaborate production with a high-end ""traveling troupe"" style cart:

>...when that summer was over, by that time, the father of one of the kids had built a cart for the commedia play. So that made that the most traveling theater. Because the stage that was loaned to us by NBC got taken back to NBC. The lights went back to CBS, wherever they went back to ... Several years later, kids who came up to my backyard said, ""You know that cart? We want to do that cart again.""

The American National Theater and Academy asked the group to redo the commedia at a LA festival, and the kids,
emboldened, wanted to take the cart to other schools. The commedia -- feeling like a slice of a historical fair -- was the imagination-spawning point of the Renaissance
festival, as (in an interview with Phyllis Patterson and her husband Ron)

>We imagined everyone in costumes and no microphones or other 20th Century mechanical devices. Perhaps it could develop into a real fair!

Many of the ""touchstones"" of the Renaissance faire developed directly from the commedia dell'arte (acrobatics, street characters,
""stock"" characters, improvising) -- you can think of it essentially as the commedia writ large.

This all eventually led to Patterson's interest in the local radio station. Pacifica Radio is generally considered the first ""listener-sponsored"" radio and it was founded as a pacifist station in 1949. The local station to the Pattersons, KPFK, was politically aligned with Phyllis's ideas, so she went to the board in January of 1963 to pitch a fundraiser: an ""open-air festival"". It became the Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California, trying to reproduce a English country fair in the spirit and time of Elizabeth I (hence a bit of a crossover with Italian and England), but also with inspiration from medieval times. In fact, the original idea was to call it explicitly medieval, but a lawyer for the radio station expressed concern about the level of ""human rights"" in medieval Europe, hence it got the name Renaissance Faire.

So the Faire was always a little bit of a historical amalgam as proposed, although the center of it was the commedia dell'arte. The commedia was popular in **16th century** Europe, in other words, after turkey legs were a perfectly normal food. Hence there was nothing ahistorical in their inclusion, and the point was never to be fully historical in the first place.

This means turkey legs were completely appropriate to have! (I should emphasize fussing over the actual word, ""medieval"" or ""renaissance"", and the exact time period, was missing the point of the event in the first place. The only reason it didn't become a Medieval Faire is that a pacifist radio station was staffed by pacifists. Plenty of modern Renaissance Faires explicitly use the term ""medieval"" anyway.) I'm unclear their exact first appearance; [an ad for the 1963 Faire](https://imgur.com/1mO9u4y) lists sweetmeats (quite Tudor-associated), tarts, gingerbread, herbs, pork pies, and sausages. Turkey did start showing up in the 60s.

One extra odd element on all this is King Henry VIII -- not quite Queen Elizabeth I's reign, but close enough for amalgam purposes -- who is probably the person most associated with turkey legs. He lived a little before the right period but some people remember [this Hans Holbein picture as him holding a turkey leg](https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/hans-holbein-the-younger/henry-viii.jpg) -- it's really gloves, Mandela effect ahoy -- and there's plenty of pop-imagery, like [Homer from The Simpsons as Henry VIII](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/King_Henry_VIII). Henry + turkey leg certainly had the association prior to the first Faire (""[Jehli tore me apart with all the delicacy of Henry VIII attacking a turkey leg](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Americada/RW2ueoileaIC?hl=en&gbpv=0&bsq=henry%20viii%20turkey%20leg)"" from 1959) so the relation wasn't created by the Faire, but by aiming for Tudor-food, it was an easy choice to make even if the chronology is a little mixed up.

AskHistorians,How did the Soviet Union just collapse?,"A repost of this [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/axu4i3/mikhail_gorbachev_is_viewed_as_a_hero_by_the/ehwc8l1/) I wrote:

**PART I**

Gorbachev's reforms are ultimately responsible for the Soviet collapse, which saw the end of Soviet superpower status, a massive reduction in the Soviet military's size and strength, the unilateral evacuation of all territories in Central and Eastern Europe occupied at great human cost in the Second World War, and a rapidly declining economy fragmented into fifteen separate states. Much of the argument that the Soviet political system and economy needed reform needed change to avoid collapse came directly from him - the phrase ""Era of Stagnation"" to describe the Brezhnev years is actually a piece of Gorbachev's rhetoric.

However there seems to be a strong case (made by Stephen Kotkin in Armageddon Averted), that while the Soviet economy was growing at ever slower rates, and increasingly unable to close the ever-present gap in living standards between the USSR and the West, probably could have continued to muddle on - there was no imminent danger of political and economic collapse in 1985.

It's also important to note that Gorbachev's reforms did not cause the collapse of the USSR on purpose, and Gorbachev was always committed to maintaining the union in some reformed shape under an economic system that was still socialist. However, his reforms both began to pick apart the centralized economy without really creating new institutions, which caused severe economic disruptions, and his political reforms unleashed new political movements outside his control, while all of these reforms antagonized more hardline members of the nomenklatura (party establishment). Ultimately he lost control of the situation.

The Soviet system was highly-centralized and governed in a top-down approach, and it was Gorbachev who put reforms into motion and also removed members of the Soviet government and Communist party who opposed reforms.

Gorbachev's period tends to get divided into roughly three periods: a period of reform, a period of transformation, and a period of collapse.

The period of reform lasted roughly from 1985 to 1988, in which Gorbachev and his supporters in the government (notably Eduard Shevardnadze, Gorbachev's foreign minister and the future President of Georgi, and Aleksandr Yakovlev, Gorbachev's ally on the Politburo and the intellectual driver of reforms) tried a mixture of moderate reforms and moral suasion to revitalize the Soviet economy as it was, echoing Khrushchev's reforms of 20 years previous. While the goal was a revitalization of Soviet society and the economy, there was a very strong focus on morality: this period notably featured the anti-alcoholism/prohibition campaign, and very public campaigns against corruption (Dmitry Furman called this a ""sort of Marxist Protestantism"").

When these efforts did not secure the results that Gorbachev and his reformers desired, more far-reaching reforms were pursued in the 1988-1990 period. This is when Gorbachev made massive changes to Soviet foreign policy, such as withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1989, announcing unilateral cuts to military spending and forces at the UN in 1988, and more or less cutting the USSR's Eastern European satellite states in 1989. On the domestic sphere, this is when Gorbachev pushed through major political changes to the Soviet system, pushing through a new Congress of People's Deputies to be filled through semi-free elections, removing the Communist Party's monopoly of power and creating the office of President of the USSR for himself in 1990. This is also the period when glasnost (""openness"", ie the lifting of censorship) took off, and these all were largely attempts to establish a new base of support for continued reforms once it became clear to Gorbachev that most of the Communist Party was uninterested in this.

These reforms ushered in the 1990-1991 chaos, at which point Gorbachev essentially lost control. Falling oil prices and the crackdown on alcohol sales (which were a massive part of the Soviet budget), plus Gorbachev's loosening of management and sales restrictions on state firms while maintaining most of their subsidies, plus plans for importing of new Western machine tools and technology to revitalize the economy, seriously destabilized the Soviet budget, and caused the government to turn to the printing presses to cover ever increasing deficits."
AskHistorians,How accurate were busts of famous people in the ancient world? If I am looking at a bust of Caesar or Augustus how likely is it that I am seeing the face of the person who the image is meant to represent?,"Augustus is probably the most recognizable “face” from the ancient world. For our purposes, I’m going to link to an image of [Augustus of Prima Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_of_Prima_Porta), probably the most famous statue we have of the man. But I am also going to link to an article [from the Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-unearth-marble-bust-augustus-italy-180977655/) from two years ago wherein some archaeologists suspect they found a head of Augustus. Probably the only other figure as easily identified right out of the ground is Antinous, the “consort” of Hadrian who was deified after a very mysterious death. Quite a legacy. 

The ancient biographer Suetonius working for Hadrian more than a century after Augustus’s death (and probably looking at some of the statues around just as we would) in Book II chapters 79-80 of his *Twelve Caesars* gives an account of his appearance. The serene expression, bright eyes, and overall handsomeness *in his youth* were commented upon. This is reflected in the depictions we have of him, but Suetonius may have been working from the same stuff we are. Suetonius also said his eyebrows met and that his skin was covered with blemishes, something we don’t see much evidence for in the unpainted depictions we have of Augustus now. I’ll leave it to the reader to decide how closely the surviving statues match the description. 

So, were the portraits “taken from life?” We don’t know. Unfortunately, we probably can’t know. But we can guess a lot! Augustus was a fairly young man when he became emperor and his portraiture remained eternally youthful even as he lived until 75. Mary Beard in her *Twelve Caesars* (not really about the Suetonius at all, actually!) notes that while we have 20 *pedestals* that once had the image of Julius Caesar above them, we have 140 from Augustus during his own lifetime. A few scholars say that there may have been as many as 25,000 portraits in the empire. Luckily for us, a few of the statues that do exist have a name attached to them (we don’t have that for any statue for JC), and they all are alarmingly similar, down to the way curls fall on the forehead. It seems very likely that there was some kind of imperial model that was sent to disparate parts of the empire and imitations were set up in the public areas of various cities and towns in what could only be described as a mass propaganda program, although again we have no proof, just dozens of statues with similar enough that the locks of hair are arranged the same way on a forehead. (Beard, pages 65-68). 

So what we see seems to have been what Augustus wanted his empire to have seen. I think it’s doubtful that Augustus would have wished that his exact image, warts and all, to be the face the new Roman Empire. We know already he never wanted himself to age. Instead, it seems likely that he wanted to express stability and unity by spreading imperial portraiture across the empire and that he chose an eternally youthful, perfected image of himself and his family to do so. Maybe he sat at one point for a portrait, maybe he just approved one. 

Why would he do this?

When Augustus came to power after the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE, a 75 year-old Roman would have seen the Social War, Sulla’s purges, the Cataline Conspiracy, Caesar’s March to Rome, the war between first Caesar’s assassins and Antony and Octavian and then the war between Octavian and Antony and Cleopatra. Most Romans were not that old and merely would have seen harrowing events once a decade or two, and Roman subjects at the edges of the empire would have known there were troubles at the heart. Octavian, merely one man who could not be everywhere at once, needed to be known everywhere as the rightful leader of Rome. He took the name Augustus but also called himself *Caesar,* as did his successors. Jesus in the Bible says “render unto Caesar what is Ceasar’s,” and this earthly ruler seems rather distant from the happenings in the eastern edge of his empire, more a name than a person, a statue in the town square and someone whose name the tax collector invoked. There’s no reason for a realistic portrait. 

And the name Caesar stayed. Beard points out that it’s often difficult to differentiate portraits of Ceasar’s successors or would be heirs as they often fit a “type”  first seen with Augustus himself (Beard 69). Augustus reigned 40 years and no other emperor after that came particularly close and as primogeniture was not practiced in Rome establishing legitimacy was paramount for any new emperor. Harkening back to the old ones was a very good way to do that. 

So yeah, most historians think we see a heavily idealized image of Augustus when we look at his portraits and that portraits of later Caesars were as political as ones of earlier ones.

AskHistorians,"Why did the British lose the American War of Independence, according to the British in the 18th and 19th century?","The short version is that high-ranking British leaders and politicians felt that the war had been lost because of incompetent bungling. Those who had been opposed to the war blamed the British ministry as a whole, the army blamed the navy, and the navy blamed the politicians. There was no consensus on who or what was at fault, and in the end many leaders took their portion of the blame, and tried to move on with their careers.

But the longer answer is that the war engendered intense acrimony between individual leaders, and though the competing interests of the ministry, the army, and the navy all had their place in the post-Yorktown world, the most intense debate was between the two seniormost army officers in North America: Sir Henry Clinton and Lord Charles Cornwallis.

Immediately following the defeat, as was customary in any army, both men wrote reports and letters giving their view on events, and casting blame on perceived failures in order to explain how it had come about. Initially, Clinton blamed the navy for failing to deliver promised reinforcements in a timely manner.

Cornwallis, writing his official report of the action, however, seemed to suggest (in the polite and indirect manner of 18th century gentlemanly discourse) that he had been compelled to stay in Yorktown despite his desire to relocate because Clinton had both promised reinforcements and had, in any case, *ordered him* to stay despite his advice to the contrary. Bristling, Clinton wrote to Cornwallis asking for an explanation of the perceived slights, and Cornwallis somewhat limply replied that he wrote in haste and was fatigued, and didn't mean to make any implications. But the damage was done, the report was public, and Clinton felt that his reputation had taken a dramatic hit regardless of the polite intentions of his subordinate. This was exacerbated in part because, on his return to England, Cornwallis was quite warmly received, where Clinton felt his own had been cold. How much of this is reality, and how much is a bruised ego looking for comfort is hard to tell. 

After a short letter-writing campaign, Clinton composed a pamphlet of his own intended to refute Cornwallis' official report, in which he blamed the failure in North America *firmly* on Cornwallis. Not only did he append some of his official correspondence in the pamphlet, he also alleged that far from Cornwallis being forced to stay in Yorktown in unfavorable conditions, he had led himself to that state himself by willfully violating previous orders, and marching into Virginia against his advice. The argument was that if Cornwallis had simply stayed in the Carolinas, he wouldn't have been in a position to need reinforcements from the navy in any case. But at least in this pamphlet, there was no blame placed on the navy at all, it was all Cornwallis. This, too, could have been politically motivated, because while the navy had taken something of a black eye in public perception in 1781, it had soundly thrashed the French fleet in 1782, and the British public were once again proud of their navy; if Clinton tried to push too hard in blaming Admiral Rodney he might suffer a public backlash.

There's not much more to get into; high ranking members of the British leadership blamed each other for perceived failures and hounded each other for perceived slights that set back their careers and harmed their prospects. No one agreed on exactly why the war ended in failure, but everyone agreed that it certainly hadn't been *their* fault.

This is all rather typical of post-action politics, by the way. No victory is as clear-cut as history might make it seem, and we can add *finding a person or institution to blame for a defeat* to the rest of the necessary skills of a military leader. Sometimes these acrimonious accusations follow even *successful* battles or campaigns.

Most of this is just a summary of Richard Middleton's *The Clinton-Cornwallis Controversy and Responsibility for the British Surrender at Yorktown*, which I'd recommend you read if you're interested in the topic. Mine is a pretty concise summary and you might find the whole thing interesting.

As always, I'd be glad to answer followups."
AskHistorians,How did Silent Film makers deal with Illiteracy?,"Here’s a question I may actually be able to answer. A lot of this answer is drawn from my college film studies which is now coming up on a decade ago, so apologies if any of my info is out of date. I think your question may be based on a faulty assumption, namely that silent film was primarily a narrative format or that it was understood narrative first. Film today certainly is primarily understood that way, but that wasn’t yet true in the early days of cinema.

Many of the earliest silent films were more visual experiences. Some of the earliest examples were little more that live shots of various everyday places or events. One famous example shot by the Lumiere brothers consisted of nothing but a train rushing onward toward the camera, and is best known today for, as u/aldusmanutius points out below, the exaggerated or entirely mythical reactions it was said to have created in audiences, more a visual marvel than a narrative device.

As film advanced it’s certainly true that narrative filmmaking began to take shape, and that narrative aids like inter-titles were introduced. That trend would continue through the silent era, and toward the end of the era you have entire complex narratives being told by the interplay between visual storytelling and the written word. But if you were to take the average silent film and remove every inter-title, it would still make plenty of sense. Inter-titles aren’t necessarily a requirement for the audience to understand. They’re an additional tool to reinforce a visual story.

It’s interesting that in your question you point to several famous examples of Soviet film which is a favorite topic in film schools the world over. You ask if the films were only intended for the literate, I’d tell you that it’s largely the opposite. Socialist/Revolutionary filmmaking has a long and storied history on every continent with quite a few famous examples in both the silent era like *Potemkin* and *Oktober*, and in later eras like *La hora de los hornos* from Argentina and *Memorias del Subdesarrollo* from Cuba. Socialists, Communists and Revolutionaries the world over have chosen to invest in film institutes and directors precisely because they believe film is the perfect way to reach the illiterate and the less educated.

Unlike pamphlets or treatises which must either be read or read to you, film can be directly experienced by everyone regardless of their level of education. Many of the Soviet directors who worked throughout the movement pointed to the democratizing power of film, and treated it as a people’s art form. Lev Kuleshov noted film theorist, director, and a leading figure in Soviet cinema during that period, is best known for the effect that bears his name. Basically the Kuleshov effect is the concept that viewers will draw conclusions about a frame in a film from the frames that come before it. The idea is that the viewer will interpret a montage differently as the sum of its parts. The ultimate realization of that concept is telling a complete story in a purely visual way. That became the foundational idea of the Soviet montage movement that men like Kuleshov and Sergei Eisenstein, the director of both the films you mention, pioneered. It’s a visual storytelling technique, no inter-titles necessary. That isn’t to say they weren’t in there, but they weren’t a requirement.

The Soviet’s precise goal in these cases was to promote an art form that everyone from the most educated critic to the poorest peasant could take part in and appreciate, an art form for the revolution. Those ideals may not have always been put into practice but the purpose was always to create an art form that could truly belong to everyone.  


EDIT: To address the clarification kindly provided by u/aldusmanutius down below, check out his comment for more info about the Lumiere's early work"
AskHistorians,"Ancient Rome is famous for its road building, but what was the situation like in China around the same time period? (Say 200BCE to 200CE) Was there a similar network of roads spanning the Empire?","The road system within the Han Dynasty was largely built upon the foundation established by the Qin Dynasty. As the first unified dynasty, Qin needed to establish a nationwide road system to consolidate its rule and transport its armies, much like the Roman and Persian Empires. However, the roads of the Qin and Han dynasties were not as ""luxurious"" as the Roman Empire. They were wide(about fifty feet) and had street trees, but don't have layers, only paved stones on some important roads.

https://preview.redd.it/y4xvxatloq4b1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=83119c8b9a9a3b26c92588972556afe4f0d44cb8

Take a look at this small map of Qin (I couldn't find a clearer version):

．The east-west purple and green road is ""Chidao (馳道，*Fast Riding Road*)""

．The north-south red road is ""Zhidao (直道，*Straight Road*)""

Chidao were the backbone of domestic transportation during the Qin and Han Dynasties. And Zhidao, specifically, was built to counter the threat of the Xiongnu and directly connected to the Great Wall region.

The Orange Road was a plank road that traversed the Qinling Mountains. According to records, a section of this route was carved into the mountainside with square wooden beams inserted and wooden boards laid to create a suspended pathway. However, it was burned down by Liu Bang during the Chu-Han Contention and was not rebuilt until more than a hundred years later. It seems to be replaced by the ""Baoxiedao (褒斜道，*A Slope Road to Bao*)"" constructed by Emperor Wu of Han.

Lastly, there is the purple-colored ""Shudao (蜀道，*Sichuan Road*)"" . The route was initially established during the Qin Dynasty and was extended for military purposes to northern Vietnam during the Han Dynasty. This road was incredibly challenging to travel, with certain sections being suspended pathways. The renowned Tang Dynasty poet, Li Bai, described the difficulty of the Shudao as ""like climbing to the sky.""

In the Western Han Dynasty, a few more roads leading to the southeastern cities were built. And the newly built roads in the Eastern Han Dynasty were concentrated in Jiaozhi (交趾，Guangdong and northern Vietnam).

AskHistorians,"[Examples in Text Body] What are some interesting examples of early records describing/depicting something seemingly so fantastical that reviewers viewed these depictions as myth, only for more recent review to suggest that these records may hold some credibility?",">but - to my knowledge - there’s been some acceptance that these early recording were simply attempting to convey the existence/discovery of the king cobra

The problem with this argument, and it is symptomatic of a lot of identifications like this, is that there are actually cobras in the Near East, [they are prominently depicted in the iconography of Egypt.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uraeus) It does not really make sense for someone in the Eastern Mediterranean to be confused by the description of a cobra! This is a basic problem with a lot of these sort of two step explanations, in which you have some fantastic story, some real world things that can sort of explain it if you squint and turn your head, and so boom, that's done and sorted. It is the same basic methodology as Mr. Portokalos in *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* uses to prove that kimono is a Greek word (derived from *chimona,* ""winter"", when you want to wear a robe).

Incidentally this enterprise can be called ""Euhemerism"" after the Greek philosopher Euhemerus, who theorized that the gods were actually ancient kings whose attributes had grown in the telling. This is not always wrong, there are absolutely cases where real historical figures gain mythological characteristics (there is also the inverse, when mythological figures become interpreted as historical, for example the Chinese historian Yan Kuan famously argued on linguistic grounds that the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were deities who became interpreted in a historical manner) but it requires a lot of care and context.

That aside, yes! There are absolutely cases where texts and stories that were widely doubted have been vindicated by archaeology or later research. Perhaps most famously, or infamously rather, is the case of the peoples and cultures of the Americas before Christopher Columbus. Many of the early ""explorers"" described fabulous sights, great kings and civilizations, Francesco de Oreana depicts the lower Amazon river as densely populated with settlements stretching for miles, and reports from Hernando de Soto's expedition tell of large cities and great kingdoms in what is now the southern United States. But writing centuries later historians cast doubt on this for reasons that could be understandable (conquistadors are not known for the scrupulous truthfulness) but were undeniably tinged with racist assumptions about the capabilities of Native Americans. But archaeology has vindicated them, the archaeology of the Amazon in particular is a very exciting field right now and has really upended the understanding of south American history in the last few decades. And there are plenty of cases like this, and one could easily argue that early scholars bear a great portion of the blame for the rise of charlatans like Graham Hancock and the ""ancient astronaut theorists"" reaching for fantastical explanations for sites like the moai of Easter Island.

This is really all part of the process of scientific research in the classical sense, the steady accumulation of knowledge disrupting early theories and replacing them with more durable ones."

AskHistorians,"If Medieval Society Had No Police, What Did They Have?","I wrote an answer to a question that was similar, asking about murder investigations in early Medieval England, I'll repost it below.

___

So the stage is set, the body is in the street, bloodied dagger some yards away, and you, the guilty party, have fled across town (probably not all that far truth be told given the size of London at this time [though it is still by far the largest city in England]).

Now the time frame that you've specified places us in Norman England though early enough that the majority of the populace was still using Anglo-Saxon law codes and practices; we don't really get into major Norman overhauls of the legal code until the 12th century.  London is a little bit of a weird case, but we can be general enough to lay out some possibilities.  

For the sake of simplicity I'm going to assume that you and your victim are both free (slavery was still around legally for at least 5 more years in England) able bodied men engaged in some local craft.  So you've killed someone, left the body in the streets, and made it back to your dwelling seemingly undetected, what happens next?  Well obviously someone will find the body in the morning and report it to a local authority.  Who would that be?  

Now for much of the world until modern times there was no independent (ostensibly) and investigative group of institutions that sought to enact, enforce, and execute the law. Modern media translates modern municipal police departments into medieval-esque institutions such as the ""town guard"" (think the *Skyrim* Hold guards), but is that how it worked in the actual Middle Ages? In short, no.  Nor would soldiers of any description be permanently stationed within the city of London at this time for the express purpose of hunting down and investigating criminals.  So the people who are going to be looking for you are not the medieval equivalent of detectives and beat cops.  Instead word will likely spread until someone directly connected with the victim can identify the body.  Though people might simply know them based on sight depending on how well known the person was in the community.

In Anglo-Saxon England vigilantism, not a town guard or much less police force, was more or less the ""default"" method of conflict resolution between equal members of society. There was no real distinction between vigilante justice and ""official"" justice, nor did independent courts, lawyers, etc... exist at this point in England's history. Especially in the Early Anglo-Saxon period our ideas of objective justice and an independent judiciary/police force just simply were not a part of society. Justice and revenge were extremely interlinked, and the line between official prosecution and a lord taking justice ""into his own hands"" was significantly blurrier than we might imagine. 

So the kinds of people who would be investigating the murder would be the people who were responsible for/to the dead person in some way.  These could be their surviving relatives such as brothers, sons, fathers, in-laws, or it could be someone connected to them by social/political bonds, if you've killed a thane or some other dependent of a local big wig he might get involved and round up some others to look around.  Let's say that your hapless victim's family is made aware of their death and have rounded up some cousins, people who owe them favors, and others to look around and find out what happened, your victim's local patron has also been notified.  So these people who were tied to the victim in some way would then start essentially an investigation, this could be questioning potential witnesses, tracking down people known to have had problems with the deceased and so on. 

But how could these people find you specifically?  You've gotten away scott free, or so you think.  While you may have discarded the weapon and left the scene of the crime unseen, did you arrive home unseen?  You probably don't live alone in a medieval city so who saw you come into your dwelling at some ungodly hour?  Did they see the blood on your clothes that you surely have from the murder (if you are not extremely wealthy you probably don't have tons of spare clothes lying around to change into)?  Do you have nosy or chatty neighbors who might rat you out?  And let us not forget the murder weapon!  

You like any other self respecting Anglo-Saxon well to do man probably have a knife on you most of the time, and its probably what you used in the murder.  So know you're out a knife that people might recognize as yours that is alongside the dead body, and your neighbors might be a little suspicious if you were making a noise at some freakishly early hour.  So things aren't looking good, but this is all circumstantial right?  Well...that might not matter much

All of this would add up and make you a figure of suspicion, but in the absence of damning obvious evidence what would happen next?  Unfortunately for you, your personal weapon has been found at the scene of the crime and one of your neighbors recalls that you came home very late and in something of a rush with blood all over your clothes.  So things aren't looking good.

Your victim's brother formally brings a suit against you at the next meeting of the local hundred meeting (basically a monthly community court/assembly) and accuses you of murder, what happens next?  

Well this depends a great deal on a variety of factors.  Do you want to admit that you killed the man, but there were extenuating circumstances?  Did he owe you a great debt?  Had he recently insulted you?  Was he involved in a crime against you or your family?  All of these factors would be taken into account and could change both the way the ""trial"" is handled and potential consequences you might face.  In that case local notables such as important peers such as other craftsmen, the local churchmen, and a representative of the king would likely convene and decide on a sentence that befits the crime and any extenuating circumstances.  This could be exile, the death penalty, or if the extenuating circumstances were strong enough, you could instead be ordered to undertake penance instead.

But lets say that you deny everything, you've never shared more than a word with the man, your knife was stolen a week ago, and you were arriving late because you were out and about on business.  So its your word against the word of the people accusing you.  

Now this is where it can get complicated and it really matters who you know and how much they like you.  You have the option of essentially calling in a series of character witnesses to swear that you would never be involved in such a heinous crime.  These kinds of people would be your relatives, in-laws, your patron and his networks, etc...  If you are a man of good repute with no prior black marks against your honor, and able to call in some favors from your own influential patrons, this will probably be the end of the matter...unless it can be demonstrated that you're lying.

This would be a huge problem for you as you have now sullied not only your own honor by lying, but the honor of those who stood up for you.  This could entail its own punishment (likely some form of mutilation of your face or mouth alongside not being able to call witnesses or bear witness in court in the future)

However if you cannot call in these favors, or if you have previously run afoul of the law before, the number of witnesses you need will be higher and you might be in trouble.  You can appeal to an ordeal instead if you'd like to try and play for time or put the matter in the hands of God, but the Church and local authorities might not allow this if they think you are plainly guilty and trying to get out of punishment.  The ordeal is a process by which you must plunge your hand or (if you have an ill reputation) your arm into a cauldron of boiling water and retrieve a stone.  The would would be examined some time later to determine if God had said you were guilty or not.  Now this is actually probably not what would actually occur however.  If you invoked an ordeal, it was more like declaring an appeal to the Church according to Peter Brown, and in the time before the actual ordeal itself the Church would try and find some agreement between the two parties.  

This could be something like a monetary payment, dependent on the social status of the person you killed, and an agreement to undergo penance as well as swearing an oath to not pursue the matter further or try to take further violent action.

So if you decide to not go with an ordeal, the assembly will likely render a judgement based on the evidence presented, the witnesses (both in the sense of actual witnesses and character judges/patrons), and taking your own history into account.  The end result, especially in Norman times, is more likely to be physical punishment up to and including death, rather than the earlier practices of paying wergeld (literally man price, or the amount of money that was attached to people depending on their station in life).  Now depending on if you've actually been physically restrained or apprehended, you might try and escape, and this would have you declared an outlaw, able to be killed on sight by anyone, little more than a wolf as far as the law was concerned.

Now notice what isn't mentioned here, evidence, trials by lawyers, juries of your peers, judges evaluating evidence, precedent, and case law.  All of these hallmarks of modern law quite simply did not exist.  Indeed, the actual fact of your guilt isn't really as important so much as your ability, or the suing party's ability, to claim innocence and have it backed up by other members of good standing, the actual facts, evidence (rudimentary as methods the of collecting it were), and so on.  What matters is not your actual guilt, but your ability to be convicted based on your social reputation and that of your victim."
AskHistorians,Is it a fringe theory to assume Jesus was influenced by Buddhism?,"To add to what /u/SentientLight provided, as I understand it from a historical context, the first Christian notice of Buddhism is with Clement of Alexandria in 212AD. In his *Stromata* (ie, Miscellanies), he recognizes some Indians who obey the precepts of Boutta, ""whom on the account of his extraordinary sanctity they have raised to divine honours."" Clement spoke highly of Buddhism, calling it a philosophy ""first in its ranks"" for shedding light over the nations."" He likely had access to Buddhist texts thanks to Ashoka's command to spread the dharma amongst Greek rulers in the 3rd century BC (Rock Edict XII). It wouldn't be far fetched for him to see similarities between the Buddhist ""prajna"" (roughly ""wisdom"" or ""insight"") and the Greek ""sophia"" (also, roughly ""wisdom"" or ""insight into the true nature of reality"") given the esoteric meanings of the words and their presence in cosmopolitan Alexandria.

I wrote a little bit about this in an answer related to the [lack of Buddhism's spread to the west](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4txvom/why_didnt_hinduism_buddhism_taoism_or_any/d5lepl0/?context=3) in a post awhile ago. Some more context is provided there around the ""freeflow exchange of ideas and rituals"" that fit within the early contexts of Christianity's interactions with various locals. That doesn't mean Jesus was influenced by Buddhism; the *Stromata*'s time in the early 3rd century CE being the first Christian reference does seem to imply those ideas were not at the forefront of anyone's mind at the time. Then again, the exact timing of when various Buddhist texts were available on a wider scale is not something I know. Given trade routes and the melting pot that was Alexandria, it's likely there was awareness. But ""awareness of"" doesn't mean ""influenced by"" in my opinion.

David Scott's paper on [Christian Responses to Buddhism in Pre-Medieval Times](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269964) may be worth a read!"

AskHistorians,"In the late 1800s the Irish were widely despised in the US. How were they able to dominate police departments, which is a very high-authority position? Did they face any pushback from racist politicians?","This response is largely focused on the Boston police force, which is one of the first two professional police forces in the US (New York was the other). Boston also has a very large Irish population.

Policing in the US was not always a very powerful position. Constables in the US were one of the earlier forms of police. They were both officers of the court (serving papers, brining in witness) and act at a public safety officer (killing feral dogs, clearing road obstructions, making arrests, etc) but their powers were limited.

On top of this was the night watch. It's a system carried from England where every adult man was responsible for taking turns patrolling the street and raising the hue and cry calling every able bodied man to help apprehend criminals. People could pay a substitution fee to have someone else take their turn. The night watch became the job of the old, unemployable, and undesirables. In Boston, they would walk with a rattle and many a night watchman would swing the rattle as he walked to alert criminals he was near to avoid having to raise the hue and cry.

In 1838 Boston began a reform of their policing force after a number of riots. One riot was caused by a company of Italian firefighters and an Irish funeral procession getting into a brawl as neither wanted to move off of the sidewalk so the other could pass. The Irish took over the engine house and the firemen retreated into a church and rang the bells, calling other companies to come help them. The public also joined in, generally siding with the firefighters. The Irish were pushed back to their neighborhoods and the supporters of the firefighters broke windows, busted into houses, and destroyed property. The mayor called out the militia and stationed a man at every church to prevent false alarms from reigniting the fight.

In 1838, Boston hired six officers who would be paid by the city instead of court fines. They were a day police force to begin and answered to the marshall. Their duties were largely the same as the constable and their power was likewise limited. The city soon added a night police force and over the next 15 years or so, The police force grew to about 44 day police, 22 night police, and 5 detectives. 

Many of the officers and detectives were complicit in the crime they were supposed to stop. Police were paid off by vice lords and even committed burglaries. To stop this, the city fired the night police and some day police but kept the night watch in place.

Similar to the night watch, police at this point were not well loved nor terribly trusted. They were largely jobs for the lowly. 

In 1852, James W. Gerard traveled to London to observe the London police, who had a uniformed and professional police force. He published findings about the difference between New York and London police and urged the New York police to adopt the London model. London had 7,000 to 8,000 officers to New York's 1,040. The London police stood out in a crowd because of their uniform while American police blended in with everyone, making it difficult to identify them at need. 

Gerard also stressed the moral character required by the London police.
>The candidates for the place must be men of character and intelligence they must be young and vigorous, sober and ambitious, of a forbearing temper, and of unquestioned honesty.
Gerard also stressed the need for London police to be physically fit and intelligent. He also called for a military structure with military drilling. 

Gerard also recommended a board of commissioners appoint police rather than alderman and for merit based retention rather than political retention, allowing the best police to remain on duty. In other words, a professional police force.

While it's unclear whether Boston aldermen read the report, it seems likely given that the city started similar reforms in 1853. They created a police chief with captains under him. The captains had lieutenants under their command who supervised street patrolmen (In 1857, sergeants were added to supervise patrolmen and lieutenants worked on more administrative tasks).
In 1885, the Massachusetts General Court placed the department under state control allowing the governor to appoint a person commissioner board approved by the council.

Uniforms entered the Boston police on November 1, 1859. They were a blue coat, blue pants, black vests, and police buttons. Chiefs and captains got dress coats while patrolmen and deputies got frocks. Gerard believed the military look would frighten criminals and the uniform would give police a sense of respect for their job and selves.

In this, Gerard was wrong. Both the police and the public resisted the uniforms. The public saw the militarization as a threat to their liberty, harkening to the long held fear of standing armies. They also opposed the cost of outfitting the police. The police and their supporters felt the uniform would put them on par with servants and some compared the uniform with servant livery. In Philadelphia, some officers would change out of their uniforms after leaving the station. 

In Boston, these changes continued through the end of the 19th century. The legislature unified all police under a single department structure headed by a 3 person commission. It also ushered in changing the focus of the police from community safety (housing drunks for the night, delivering food to the poor, still killing those poor dogs) to that of crime fighting and protecting the wealthy from the ""criminal class."" Professional and militarization continued from that point until today.

All of this is to say that police power as we know it today was not an aberration in the past, it simply wasn't the same. Yes, political machines could aim the power of the police forces they controlled, they still weren't the political forces they are today. Rather, they were the arm of a powerful body but not necessarily powerful by themselves. The fact that Irish men became police is rooted in political machines, population statistics, and the larger public perception of who was fit for the job. The police accumulation of political power was a gradual thing that was slow to start but picked up steam along the way. Boston police tried to use it in 1919 when they went on strike to affiliate with the AFL. They were crushed, however. Today, though, police unions, though they look nothing like traditional unions nor what the Boston police attempted in 1919, are some of the strongest lobbying forces in many cities.

Do we have any idea how many animals bronze age hebrew people were aware of? Do we know of any examples of ancient jewish natural philosophy?","I can't answer this:

>Do we have any idea how many animals bronze age hebrew people were aware of?

And can only partially answer this:

>Do we know of any examples of ancient jewish natural philosophy?

But there is a potential issue with your premise:

>In the biblical story of the Flood, Noah takes two of every animal onto his ark to ride out 40 days and nights of flooding.

It's by no means a fatal issue, and likely won't affect the answers to your core question much, but the idea that Noah took two of every animal is an oversimplification of the Biblical narrative. In particular, this is relevant when contemplating, say, the logistical issues of feeding the carnivores.

Genesis 6:19-21 ESV

>And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.”

So ""two of every animal"" is certainly a reasonable conclusion for a quick reading.

However, when one keeps reading...

Genesis 7:2-3

>Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate, and seven pairs of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.

So for many animals, they actually had *fourteen* specimens.

This is relevant to answering your latter question about ancient Jewish natural philosophy. This is by no means an area I've made any particular study of; I would greatly welcome elaborations and corrections. But I can at least give you some starting points by pointing out a few salient verses from the Old Testament.

Probably the most significant part of ancient Jewish natural philosophy in the OT is the distinction between ""clean"" animals (e.g. sheep) and ""unclean""/""detestable"" animals (e.g. pigs). This distinction is used in Levitical law to distinguish between animals that are not to be consumed by Israelites and those that they may eat, among other things. For example, unclean animals are also considered to make those who touch them ""unclean"" when, for example, a person touches their carcasse.

Leviticus 5:2 ESV

>if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt;

Leviticus 11:41 ESV

>Every swarming thing that swarms on the ground is detestable; it shall not be eaten.

Note that despite what modern laymen often presume, something being ""unclean"" is not exactly the same as being ""evil"" or ""bad"". There's no sense that ""unclean"" animals are truly evil (except perhaps the serpent's temptation of Eve in Genesis) or need to be eradicated. ""[Un]clean"" status is not something I completely understand, but it is a strange-to-modern-readers mixture of grossness (or lack thereof), ceremonial status, something akin to ""evil/bad""-ness, and physical suitability for consumption / healthiness (see Daniel et al's pseudo-vegetarianism).

For example, as shown above, someone who touches an ""unclean"" carcasse is said to have ""guilt"". But ""unclean"" status is often attained by obviously innocuous things or events beyond the individual's control (for example, menstruation and leprosy) and is generally separated from guilt of true evil. For example, levitical law prescribes the death penalty for murderers and such but almost never describes them as ""unclean"" (though ""detestable"" is fairly common).

But to return to answering your question, you'll probably be interested in distinguishing between clean and unclean animals. For that, your main resource would be Leviticus 11, snippets of which I'll quote here from the ESV:

>Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat. Nevertheless, among those that chew the cud or part the hoof, you shall not eat these: The camel, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. And the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not part the hoof, is unclean to you. And the pig, because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.

That is, ruminants with multiple hoof ""toes"" are ""clean"".

>These you may eat, of all that are in the waters. Everything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, you may eat. But anything in the seas or the rivers that does not have fins and scales, of the swarming creatures in the waters and of the living creatures that are in the waters, is detestable to you.

So seafood is generally clean, but not shellfish, dolphins, etc.

>All winged insects that go on all fours are detestable to you. Yet among the winged insects that go on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs above their feet, with which to hop on the ground. Of them you may eat: the locust of any kind, the bald locust of any kind, the cricket of any kind, and the grasshopper of any kind. But all other winged insects that have four feet are detestable to you.

So insects are generally unclean, but locusts, grasshoppers, etc. are clean (significant when one considers that John the Baptist subsisted on those very insects).

> And all that walk on their paws, among the animals that go on all fours, are unclean to you.

So dogs, lions (see the account of Samson in Judges), etc. are unclean.

>And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground: the mole rat, the mouse, the great lizard of any kind, the gecko, the monitor lizard, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.[...] Every swarming thing that swarms on the ground is detestable; it shall not be eaten. Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, any swarming thing that swarms on the ground, you shall not eat, for they are detestable.

On a different note, there also seems to be a significant distinction between birds, land animals, and marine life. For example, the account of Creation distinguishes between birds and marine life when they are added on the fifth day. Land animals are added on the sixth day.

Another note of interest is that Solomon, renowned wise king in the biblical narrative, is described so:

>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. [...] He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish.

AskHistorians,What are some common mistakes that an amateur history enthusiast might make in understanding history?,"Valuing primary sources over secondary, and first person accounts over records.

Primary sources are great in that they are created in or near the moment; however, the lack the scope and broader understanding hindsight provides to secondary sources.

First person accounts are great until you start accounting for perspective bias, mirror imaging, qui bono, intended audience, and time between experience and narration; all of these can have drastic effects on first person accounts."
AskHistorians,Why was the Korean War so much less controversial in the US and the rest of the Western world than the Vietnam War when the ideological dynamics behind the two Wars was essentially the same?,"To take things backwards:

First I'll link to a previous [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16cfixo/at_the_end_of_the_vietnam_war_the_us_negotiated_a/jzjjx0a/) I wrote for a quick timeline of US involvement in the Vietnam War, which depending on how you define it can stretch from 1964 to 1973 (conventional military involvement) to 1945 to 1975 (any sort of indirect involvement). Also worth checking out is this [answer](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8cgcip/did_we_win_or_lose_the_vietnam_war_the_shift_of/dxfcgkx/) I've written about US support for US involvement in the Vietnam War. The reality is that the initial involvement was actually pretty popular - a majority (albeit declining one) of Americans supported US involvement in the war from April 1965 to April 1967, and a majority of Americans didn't *oppose* US involvement until August 1968, with that growing to 60% opposition by 1973 (and from May 1968 to January 1973 negotiations were dragging on in Paris to end US involvement). Studies I cite in that answer note that the fall in US public support was pretty strongly linked to rising US casualties, and overall concerns of the cost of the war (as it was feeding into rising inflation at the time). It's also worth noting that disapproval of US involvement in Vietnam did *not* translate into approval for the US antiwar movement.

Some further reasons why support for the Vietnam War eroded, even within the US government can be explained by the reasons the Johnson Administration entered the war, as I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11g7l5n/why_did_america_get_involved_in_the_vietnam/janyfaf/). In short, the Johnson Administration not only sold the war on questionable-to-false pretenses with the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964 (which prompted Congress to authorize conventional military involvement in the conflict), but also because the Johnson Administration entered and prosecuted the war under wrong assumptions: they thought that the war was actually a Korean War-style aggression on the part of the People's Republic of China (ie, that North Vietnam was just acting as proxy forces for the PRC), and that the US needed to maintain ""credibility"" and not risk appearing weak or appeasing by intervening, which could result in a decisive military victory in a very short period of time. Despite public announcements to this effect, no quick decisive military victory was achieved, nor was it clear just how the US could force one, and so support began to ebb.

A few differences between this situation and the Korean War: the whole Korean War lasted just over three years: June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953. Even in this period, armistice negotiations were in progress from July 10, 1951 to July 1953, and during that period the war was mostly in a stalemate. Both during the stalemate phase and the previous year of wildly fluctuating fortunes for both sides with offensives and counteroffensives, the war was very conventional, with fairly clear frontlines and engagements. It looked far more like World War II than like a counterinsurgency, and so it was much clearer who controlled what at any given time. Actually, it looked *so* much like World War II that when Gallup [polled](https://news.gallup.com/poll/7741/gallup-brain-americans-korean-war.aspx) Americans in 1950 and 1951, a majority thought that they *were already fighting the opening stages of World War III*, which I think is a very underappreciated piece of context for the Korean War. A lot of Americans thought it was a theater in the next world war, like the Pacific Theater and European Theater were for the Second World War (and the US government did somewhat treat it this way - it sent army units to reinforce Western Germany during the Korean War to prevent a supposed Soviet attack there). 

Anyway, a further interesting point from those Gallup statistics is that the Korean War wasn't actually particularly popular among Americans, whose opinions as to whether the war was a mistake or not fluctuated wildly in relation to the course of the war itself, but neither the mistake nor not mistake side ever hit 50%, until ironically early 1953 when a majority said it wasn't a mistake (presumably because the armistice talks were close to concluding). Public opinion soured [even more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating#/media/File:Gallup_Poll-Approval_Rating-Harry_S_Truman.png) on President Harry Truman, and one can see how his approval ratings tanked with the war. He ended up getting the lowest approval rating of any president to date (22%) twice during the war, in November 1951 and February 1952 - much of this was fallout from Truman's dismissal of General MacArthur, which was deeply unpopular. The low opinion polls led Truman (much like LBJ in 1968) to not seek re-election in 1952.

Lastly, the US involvement in Korea had a stronger sheen of legitimacy: it was authorized by a UN Security Council resolution (because of a Soviet abstention - they made sure never to make that mistake again), and UN Forces were present exactly as that: a UN Command, albeit one under US control and that was mostly American troops (but did have contingents from 14 other countries included). The US public was very broadly supportive of prosecuting the Korean War through the UN (and again it had echoes of World War II, as the Allies were also formally known as the United Nations during that war) and this seems to have significantly contributed to the war being seen as legitimate.

So - overall the war in Korea wasn't really ever *that* popular, and Truman's prosecution of the war was *deeply* unpopular.  But it was a shorter, more conventional war, and one that Americans saw as having a connection to a potential (if not an actual, already-happening) global conflict, and one that had a legitimate cause."
AskHistorians,Why were the physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project so young?,"To avoid just falling into a selection trap, [here is the actual distribution of ages at Los Alamos](https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Los-Alamos-age-statistics.jpg). Bohr is the one on the old end, Ted Hall is probably the one on the youngest end, as a bit of trivia. This graph comes from the _[Manhattan District History](https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/09/05/general-groves-secret-history/)_, an internal, secret history of the project. The scientist graph is [a little younger](https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Los-Alamos-age-distribution.jpg) than a graph of ""all personnel,"" but in general Los Alamos was a pretty young place.

My sense is that there are a few factors here. One is that the cross-section of the kind of talent they want probably produces this kind of curve generally. [Here's some more recent data from the American Institute of Physics](https://www.aip.org/statistics/data-graphics/ages-physics-degree-recipients-classes-2019-and-2020-combined); that peak around 29 is basically the same as the other one, but it is (understandably) missing the people who are well-ensconced in jobs (the people in their 30s and 40s). So you can think of the Los Alamos ""set"" as being lots of people who recently got their PhDs, plus a lot of people in the category of ""mid-careers"" (30s-40s). What it lacked were people who were ""late career"" (Bohr being an interesting and extreme exception). 

It has been remarked in most recent times (e.g. in Traweek's ethnography of high-energy physicists, _Beamtimes and Lifetimes_) that the life-cycle of physicists tends to cause productive scientists to move into administrative roles over time. One finds such people in the Manhattan Project, but not in a research laboratory like Los Alamos: the ""scientist-administrators"" like Vannevar Bush, James Conant (neither physicists, but the point stands), Richard Tolman, Arthur and Karl Compton, and so on. 

Comparing this data to Nobel Prize winners is going to be a fallacy on the face of it, because it takes a long time for work to generally be recognized as Nobel Prize worthy. A more interesting thing would be compare Nobelists ages at the point in which they did the research that got them the prize; that is usually decades prior. (Bethe, for example, got a Nobel Prize in 1967 for work he did in 1938.)

Anyway, it is an interesting question. I think one can come up with various ""just so"" stories about why the age distribution was what it was, but before speculating too much I would want to see if it was actually anomalous compared to other wartime research projects, like the MIT Rad Lab or other OSRD efforts. One also wants to avoid overgeneralizing about the ""physicist"" nature of Los Alamos scientists. They may get all of the glory and cultural credit, but there were far more non-physicist scientists at Los Alamos than physicists. (One of my complaints about the Nolan film is that it makes Los Alamos feel rather small — no more than a couple dozen scientists, all apparently crammed into one building, rather than several thousand spread out across a fairly large site.)"

AskHistorians,"As I understand it, sword duels between gentlemen were rarely to the death, but rather ended at first blood. Why then did English duellers switch to using pistols when this could more easily kill them or their opponent?","So part of the issue here is the misunderstanding about how a sword duel functioned. ""To First Blood"" is a very popular image of it, but generally a misnomer. Generally speaking, duels with swords were *not* ""To first blood"", and insofar as that is a phrase that is applicable, it was only a concept that arose in the mid-19th century, characterizing *épée* duels in fin-de-siècle France^1 .

Dueling with swords was actually *very deadly* in earlier periods, and the shift to the pistol actually made dueling *safer*, insofar as that word can apply to a deadly activity. A talented swordsman can quite easily kill their opponent if they want to, and this was a very common result in duels from the beginning of the practice, up into the 1700s. The shift to the pistol  in Anglo dueling culture was driven by two factors. The first was simply the decline in the wearing of swords in daily life, but the second was the recognition that a duel with swords could be *so* unbalanced if one duelist was an accomplished swordsman, and thus many duels were little more than cold blooded murder in practical terms. The pistol was thus seen as an 'equalizer'. To be sure one could be a marksman, but it was much easier to create expectations around the conduct of a pistol duel that diminished the difference offered by skill as much as possible, including the brief firing window (usually three seconds), starting the pistol unaimed, and the duelists not looking at each other, but at the second giving the signal, and an emphasis on a quick, snap firing with little time for proper aiming, compounded by the comparatively inaccurate nature of the pistols of the period.

As such, while statistics about dueling are always hard to call definitive, the shift to the pistol is generally seen as lowering the fatality rate of the duel. Skill was taken out by a large degree and replaced by a good amount of luck. A great marksman, to be sure, had an edge against someone inexperienced, but no where near that of a great swordsman against a diletante. As such, the switch to the pistol as the most common dueling weapon - and by the beginning of the 19th century, the *only* dueling weapon - for the British duelist wasn't seen as making it more easy to kill, but rather seen as equalizing the duel, and in practical terms likely made dueling less fatal.

*But* there is an irony to it all. The pistol, it might be said, puts a high end 'cap' on the mortality rate of a duel, which, despite fluxtuations, stayed fairly consistent for the half-century after is adaptation until its demise in the 1840s. But it also has a low end bottom which is comparatively high. Pistol duels *will* result in death or injury as long as people are aiming and pulling the trigger... and while deloping (the intentional missing of your opponent by visibly shooting wide, or simply straight up) became more popular in the 19th c., this was seen as a mockery of dueling by purists ([see here for more on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a4uycc/when_aaron_burr_learned_that_alexander_hamilton/ebhz0f6/). And they weren't entirely wrong either, of course, since dueling *would* become absurd if everyone deloped! But in any case, not everyone did, and people coninuted to die, or suffer serious injuries, in duels. The final end of dueling in Britain came in the 1840s, [which I detail more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/naog6l/to_what_extent_can_the_demise_of_practice_of/gxv97tj/), but the main point as it pertains to the shift from sword to pistol is that low end 'cap'. Dueling's social meaning had shifted through the early 1800s from being less about the offended party proving their manhood to the offending party offering apology, *but while this shift logically would accompany a desire to see dueling become less fatal, the pistol prevented it from happening*. The shift had lowed the mortality rate originally, but it prevented the mortality rate from *going away* which might have preserved dueling for decades more to come. 

This *is* what happened on the continent, primarily with French and Italian duelists, where the pistol never fully supplanted the sword. The sword offers much more *control*, which meant while French duelists might be trying to stick each other like a pig in the 1600s, and doing so successfully, the accepted style of dueling could easily accomodate the shifting *social* meaning of the duel, and thus for the most part the duelists would be dancing around trying to scratch each other on the wrists. Deaths did happen, but they were rare occurances, with sometimes years going by without a fatal duel despite sometimes hundreds being fought in a given year. This allowed the duel not only to survive, but even to flourish, in Third Republic France and post-Risorgimento Italy, where the duel took on special meanings about martial manhood and the rising power of the bourgoise and their growing political conciousness. It would only be the scale of death and destruction in World War I that brought a swift decline to the duel there, from which the institution never really recovered ([more on this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z2cslw/the_last_official_duel_in_french_history_took/ixhcelq/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9ga62m/real_dueling_and_staged_dueling/e62w1zi/).

So in summation to it all, the pistol in the duel was something of a blunt instrument. It brought with it certain equalizing factors that first caused its appeal and brought about the shift, but it couldn't really adjust to changing expectations of the time in a way that was acceptable to English duelists. The sword, in comparison, is a versatile weapon, which whatever the era, and whatever the expectations for the duel, it could adjust to reflect them, either being used in deathly seriousness, or in near harmless posturing.

**[Please consult here for sources and further reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/georgy_k_zhukov/dueling)**

1: Not imporant here, but also it ought to be understood that even then the duels were not supposed to be openly agreed to end at first blood. The Seconds, under the code of the time, could decide whether the offense was seirous enough to end the duel after blood was drawn *but were not supposed to tell the duelists themselves* if this was the case, but rather simply end it after. If they had not determined that to be the case, then after blood was drawn the challenger would be asked if he was satisfied, but he was under no obligation to say so, and could continue."

AskHistorians,"Sigmund Freud is known as the father of psychology, and his ideas are immersed in our culture. But it seems like Freud was a disaster for every patient that ever worked with him. Were his ideas actually useful for treating patients, or was he just a good marketer of his ideas?","Sigmund Freud isn't really the father of psychology - though it depends on what you mean by psychology. The discipline of psychology usually traces itself back to Wilhelm Wundt, who is ultimately the reason there are scientifically-focused psychology departments around the world - Wundt really pumped out the PhDs, and many of them went to the US and Britain and other places and started psychology departments. And Wundt ultimately predates Freud by a generation. But Wundt was a researcher interested in the nature and structure of consciousness, who did experiments to try and understand things like visual perception - he wasn't a talk-therapist. But there was a lot of philosophically-minded writing about psychology and topics like the mind well before Wundt - his major innovation was to see it as a post-Scientific Revolution scientific discipline, rather than a branch of philosophy - and so there's pre-Socratic Greek philosophers who make claims about the mind, because of course philosophers are going to be very curious about that. But I digress.

Freud himself was ultimately a mix of a Wundt-styled scientific psychologist, a physiologist, a medical doctor and a philosopher. He first studied physiology, and published (pretty dry and scientific) papers on the nature of neurons, before ultimately deciding that he was too Jewish to get a job at a Vienna university and ultimately doing the training to become a medical doctor.

He clearly wasn't that excited by being a doctor, and wanted to become a big name in a field; apart from the infamous 'On Coca' paper, he wrote an unpublished manuscript a decade or so before he became known for *The Interpretation Of Dreams*, called *Project for a Scientific Psychology*, which was an attempt of sorts to make a contribution to the Wundt-derived scientific psychology literature. But ultimately it was his development of 'psychoanalysis', his talk therapy method, and the theory behind it, that became what made him famous. It's fairer to say that he's the father of talk therapy (as opposed to the kind of not-necessarily-about-mental-health research that is done on the way people think and behave).

Freud's ideas about trying to help people with mental illness by actually talking to them about their lives seem kind of obvious today - but they were surprisingly revolutionary at the time. It had generally been considered by theorists before Freud that mental illness was the result of genetics and biology, one way or another (whether based on the humoural explanations that led to words like 'melancholy' and 'sanguine', or based on more modern explanations based on the much smaller amount that was known about damaged brains). The fundamental idea in Freud that mental illness was a sort of symptom of a mismatch between biology and situation (i.e., we're animals  that are not really designed to live in civilised society) is a very post-Darwinian way of thinking (though Freud read Haeckel rather than Darwin) - but more importantly, it offered a way forward, which was breaking the various mental defenses that we've accrued as a result of years of trying to deal with the situation. There certainly are also parts of Freudian psychoanalysis that take the implications of this basic equation to its extreme - all the Oedipus complex stuff that grosses everyone out, and the in-general focus on sex that lots of people are uncomfortable with. 

In terms of how Freud's therapeutic ideas are judged today - yes, as a therapist, he was more interested in finding confirmation for his theoretical ideas than in actually helping his clients. Where the people that he gave pseudonyms to in his writings have been identified later, they don't particularly think he helped them, and often found the whole process frustrating. However, it's hard in some ways to know whether those particular clients were a bit out of the ordinary because they were the ones he was intent on writing about. And there's no particular reason why, as a talk therapist, that you have to be the kind of confirmation-bias-influenced bully that Freud was. Beyond the basic idea of talking to people and challenging some of the ways they are interpreting and dealing with the world in a systematic way, there are specific parts of Freudian thinking that are still respected by modern clinical psychologists - in particular the ideas of 'transference' and 'counter-transference', wherein the client projects their feelings about others onto the therapist, and vice versa, and the ideas of 'defense mechanisms' - all the ways we deflect uncomfortable thoughts and ideas.

In psychotherapy, there is a (still controversial) thesis called the 'Dodo Bird Verdict', which argues that all talk therapy techniques kind of work, whether it's Freudian psychotherapy, CBT, Rogerian techniques, dialectical behaviour therapy, or any other number of therapeutic styles. The extent of the Dodo Bird effect is controversial, but the fundamental insight the idea gives us, perhaps, is that the specific therapeutic techniques are all well and good, but there is something about the act of being in therapy that helps, whether your therapist is telling you about Oedipus complexes or not - having the space to talk through your problems to someone paid to listen to you is useful, as it allows you to find your own ways to reinterpret what has happened to you and how you should be feeling about it, which clearly can help a bunch of people. The specific help you get from individual treatment types is kind of icing on the cake, goes the argument. A bit like modern therapies!

I think that it is definitely more complex than the Dodo Bird verdict suggests - it's probably the case that different techniques will work better for different people, and that psychologists could do better at figuring out why that is and thus better targeting different treatments to different people. But what it suggests is that, for people in the era where psychotherapy was predominantly psychoanalytic in focus (i.e., based on Freudian ideas) it probably helped a few people a fair bit, helped a few people a little, but not to the extent they wanted, and didn't help some others."

AskHistorians,"Why isn't Spain ""good at science""?","The period you are citing wasn't exactly the most politically stable moment in Spain's history, and without stability it is close to impossible to do sny research.

The 19th century was especially turbulent in Spain. In 1808 the country got invaded by the French forces, which resulted in a very bloody 6 year long war throughout the whole country, with focuses pf insurgency everywhere. Some notable guerrilleros were Juan Díaz Porlier, Cachamuíña, Juan Palarea AKA El Médico, el Chaleco, Julián Sánchez AKA el Charro, Mina el Mozo, the Mayor of Otívar, etc. The war spared no city, town, or village.

After the war, king Fernando VII was restored on the throne, and as soon as he got his royal arse on Madrid's throne he abolished the Constitution of 1812, restoring an absolute monarchy. This, in turn, resulted in a general exile of liberal intellectuals for fears of being persecuted by the king ans his agents. Brain drains of this scale are no joke.

In the year 1820, Colonel Rafael del Riego marched with his troops to force Ferdinand VII to swear fealty to the Constitution again, which the traitorous monarch did reluctantly. So reluctantly, in fact, that he solicited the intervetion of the Holy Alliance in order to restore absolutism again. The Alliance answered the call and marched an army of 100,000 soldiers (the 100,000 sons of Saint Louis they were called, you go figure of what it is a euphemism) under the command of the Duke of Angouleme. This expedition succeded, not without sone fighting, most notably against the liberal forces of general Evaristo San Miguel. Thus, in 1823 tyranny was restored again, and more intellectuals fled the country. The decade that ensued until Ferdinand's death is called the Ominous Decade, and mot without reasons.

After this Ominous Decade of abhorrent tyranny, infante Carlos María Isidro (an absolutist) challenged Ferdinand's daughter's right to the throne, which led to a very long war the spanned the whole country. Carlos María Isidro's side finally capitulated in 1840, after seven long years of brutal war all over the country.

The reign of Isabel II was relatively peaceful, with the major exception of another carlist insurrection that lasted between 1846 and 1849. During her reign, the political situation was completely volatile, with generals O'Donnell, Espartero, and Narváez staging coups against one another on a regular basis. During the reign of Isabel there was also a small but relatively costly war in Morocco in 1860, and the Spanish participation in the French invasion of Indochina.

In 1868 the monarchy was ousted by a revolution led by generals Serrano and Prim, and admiral Topete. After quite some uncertainty and a number of proposals in parliament, Amadeo of Savoy was appointed king of Spain in 1870 under Prim's pressure. Amadeo did not fare well, considering that when he arrived in Spain the first he had to do was attend Prim's funeral, as the general had been murdered a few days prior. Amadeo's reign was short and ill-fated, ending in 1873, when he was completely saturated by the problems, including another carlist war that had started in 1872 and which was notably bloody. The 3rd carlist war did not end until 1876. 

Meanwhile, a republic was proclaimed, but a dozen cantonalist insurrections erupted, pronouncing themselves in favour of a federal-cantonal republic. The I Republic only lasted for a year, during which there were four presidents. After those four presidents, general Serrano was established as dictator, but he did not last long, with the fornal republic and his effective dictatorship ending with the coup d'état of general Manuel Pavía and the proclamation of Alfonso XII as king in 1876.

Only in 1876 Spain managed to catch a break after 70 straight years of civil wars, revolutions, tyranny, and political instabiity in general. As development is cumulative, so is lagging behind. So, more or less generally speaking Spain civil-warred and coup-d'etated itself out of any relevance."

Your question has different answers when you narrow the question to certain locations, periods, and possibly even the time of year. I can't begin to speak to all of them. But what I can do is provide a great example.

The most important thing about the lazy meal, as your mom discovered with frozen pizza, is facility... You know, easiness. As any fan of leftovers can tell you, nothing is easier than eating something that's already made!

**Pottage** was a thick soup or stew made by boiling grains and... just about anything else you have on hand. Vegetables, fish or meat if you have them, maybe even some herbs and spices. Pottage was so ubiquitous that the name's origin itself means ""food cooked in a pot."" It could be kept over or near the fire for days, with new ingredients added to replace the portions that you had already eaten. This also meant what was in your pot could be constantly changing throughout the week, or even over the day. Pottage was the quintessential peasant gruel of the middle ages and a staple food for centuries. To make it more exciting, pottage was ideally eaten with bread. The middle ages heard you liked carbohydrates, so it gave you starches with your starches.

The more luxurious evolutions of pottage *mortis* and *frumenty* were written down in what is possibly the oldest English cookbook, *The Forme of Cury* (1390). Mortis was made from blanched almonds with fish and sugar and ground with mortar and pestle, moistened with milk into a pudding or *pâté*. Frumenty was made with cracked wheat, either milk or broth, and venison and eggs.

Although this moves past the ""lazy dinner"" answer portion, I'll add that plum pottage in the 1500s was the origin of the traditional English plum pudding that's served for Christmas today.

If you're interested in more reading on the histories of food (global, but Eurocentric), Alan Davidson's *The Oxford Companion to Food* (1999) is your book."

I can also provide some answers to the questions at hand. In short, patients with type I diabetes invariably died, and died relatively young. Conversely, there is evidence of historical physicians associating what we now know as type II diabetes with lifestyle and diet choices, and recommending relevant treatment plans, with some success.

First, a brief history of the disease . There is evidence that diabetes as a disease has been known, if not fully understood, by the Egyptians as early as 5th century BCE, the Greeks and Chinese in 2nd century CE, India by the 6th century CE, and the Arab-Islamic world by the 11th century CE.^1,2 Early reports of the disease describe patients as expelling excessive quantities of strangely sweet urine. In 1776, Matthew Dobson demonstrates that diabetes patients have sugar in both their urine and their blood. In 1857, Claude Bernard discovers glycogen in the liver and proposes that the liver stores sugar in the form of glycogen in order to modulate sugar levels in the blood. The work of a dozen different individuals throughout the 1800s establishes that a diseased, damaged, or removed pancreas is associated with diabetes. And finally, in 1921, Frederick Banting and Charles Best isolate insulin for the first time.^1

So what did physicians actually recommend prior to 1900? The answer is a mix of dietary restrictions, lifestyle changes, and snake oils, to varying degrees of success.

In earlier times, remedies focused on what foods to eat, or what medicines to consume. Egyptian physicians recommended a ""decoction of wheat, bones, and other substances.""^1 Indian physicians, who recognized that late-onset diabetes was correlated with obesity, diet, and a sedentary lifestyle, suggested ""freshly harvested cereals and bituminous preparations containing benzoates and silica.""^1 In the 17th century, Thomas Willis - who was the first European medical writer to describe sweetness in the urine - believed that the disease could be treated with a ""thickening and moderately cooling diet and cordials"" and thereby recommended one patient to consume slimy vegetables, rice, white starch, and a milk drink ""distilled with cypress tops and egg whites, two powders (a mixture of gum arabic and gum dragant), rhubarb and cinnamon.""^2 Willis' patient actually improved over the course of a month but relapsed after returning to his former dietary routine. Opium was also a popular remedy in the 18th and 19th centuries, likely more for its treatment of diabetic complications than any direct treatment action.^3 Other interesting prescriptions included ""oil of roses, dates, raw quinces and gruel, jelly of viper’s flesh, broken red coral, sweet almonds and fresh flowers of blind nettles.""^3

More recently, treatments transitioned towards exercise and calorie restrictions. For example, in 1797, Thomas Rollo proposed a low-carb, meat-based diet that did lead to weight loss and a reduction in symptoms.^1 In the 1800s, exercise was popularized as a management method. In 1913, the Allen's diet, consisting of intermittent fasting followed by high fat, increased life expectancy for insulin-dependent patients from less than 18 months to over five years.^1 And in 1923, Dr. Murray Lyon and Sister Pybus began to count calories and weigh out diets for their diabetes patients, thereby laying the groundwork for modern dietary management of the disease.^1 These are, notably, not wholly distinct from a present-day treatment of diabetes, save for insulin injection.

As such, although physicians have long recognized the importance of diet and lifestyle on type II diabetes, the specific knowledge of *how* diet improves diabetes outlook - and thus, the important knowledge of what kind of diet a patient should use - was largely determined post-1600. Even so, dietary management of diabetes largely succeeded only in extending the lifespan of a diabetes patient, and the ability to live with diabetes as seen today - let alone the ability to survive at all, for patients with type I diabetes - is entirely dependent on the development of insulin.

Not only for what was discussed, but in its portrayal of someone like Stimson. Stimson very much did not believe the Japanese to be intractable, was already very concerned about the long-term consequences of the invention of nuclear weapons, did not spare Kyoto on a whim (or as easily as that), and definitely never framed it as bomb or invade.

The atomic bomb was never framed as an alternative to invasion at the time; it was bomb-and-invade, not bomb-or-invade."
AskHistorians,"""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" Are there any instances in history where scientists stopped to think and halted something before it even began?","Siddharta Mukherjee's *The Gene: An Intimate History* offers a good contextualized account of the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA. 

The short version is that the conference established, with considerable debate and internal controversy, the creation of some restrictions on research in recombinant DNA at a time when  some researchers felt that work was progressing too fast without any safety protocols or agreements about the dangers of certain kinds of work. The most important outcome was the creation of a nested series of safety protocols that are still widely used and agreement that certain kinds of research with known pathogens ought to remain off-limits. (Though I think many people suspect those restrictions have been violated in secret in bioweapons research.) 

The conference didn't put genetic engineering in humans or otherwise completely off-limits but I think you could say that it established that some kinds of research had serious ethical and policy implications as well as posing concrete dangers to the wider public if carried out in unsafe ways.

AskHistorians,"When it comes to Norse mythology, Valhalla is far more well known that Folkvangr, where half of the dead of battle went. Why is this? and did the Norse view Folkvangr as preferable or a worse fate than Valhalla?","I've written on this topic a few times before, so I'll post one of my older answers below this

___

You seem to be under the impression that the average viking raider even had an expectation of Valhalla if he died in battle and that this belief was widely shared among the Norse culture at large.  I can't really blame you, many misconceptions about the Norse have seeped into popular understandings of the Norse world that have little basis in academic consensus.  Neither of these assertions, that warriors expected to go to Valhalla or that the average non-warrior did, are really on solid ground however.  We quite simply do not know what the average beliefs of the Norsemen were prior to Christianity.  We don't even know if all of the Norse worshiped the same set of deities, and it seems overwhelmingly likely that they did not. Simply looking at the deities invoked in place names gives you the idea that certain deities were more popular than others in different parts of the Norse world and at different times, and in ways that do not match up with more popular understandings of the Norse people.

This is the first step towards understanding that Norse religious practices and beliefs were not uniform either in time or space.  What a Norseman might believe if he was a raider in the 9th century was different from what a farmer might believe in the 11th, and in turn both would be different to what a trader living in the lands of the Rus might believe in the 10th century.  Our modern western (ie Judaic/Islamic/Christian) understanding of religion gives us a certain expectation of what religious life *should* look like, but this expectation need not accurately map onto history.  

There never was one single ""Norse religion"" that was doctrinally consistent over the Norse/Germanic world, either temporally or geographically.  The stories that Snorri Sturluson edited and compiled into his own works almost certainly were not the same as the stories that held sway in Sweden, or Geatland, or Saxony before its conquest by Charlemagne.  Indeed Snorri's own work was compiled centuries after conversion to Christianity in Iceland, long after remnant communities would have stayed pagan.  Indeed, even the Eddas are inconsistent on who gets to go to Valhalla or Freyja's Halls, many sources make no mention of Freyja's halls at all, and this ambiguity and inconsistency shouldn't be surprising.  

This inconsistency in the sources seems to indicate to me at least, and certainly plenty of scholars who have fancy degrees and DO read Old Norse, that there was never any sort of doctrinal coherence to Germanic paganism or Old Norse practice.  So this is a roundabout way of saying that while your question is a reasonable one and certainly an interesting one, it unfortunately will likely remain an unanswerable one.

Perhaps it might be best to conclude on an analogy.  I do not know your particular religious affiliation, but I'm going to assume that you're roughly familiar with Christianity.  Christianity has many things that Norse paganism lacks, such as a single coherent book from which the majority of the religion's theology is derived, and yet any conversation with different denominations or a cursory examination of religious history will show that getting everyone to agree what constitutes Christianity and what the various beliefs of the religion should be is extremely complicated.  Hell, theological debates, excommunications, and the like have raged between old and storied Churches over a single word in a prayer.  Now take all of those divisions, and remove the Bible as an authoritative source.  Now imagine what that might mean for the religion.  Indeed, it might seem that it would be all but impossible to construct a religious system with firm answers to a lot of questions in the absence of such a central work.  

How can this be you might ask?  Norse mythology is almost as well known these days as Greek mythology, surely we have an extensive source basis to rely on such as the Sagas?  Unfortunately however, we cannot treat the sources available to us like we would religious texts such as the Bible, Talmud, or Koran.  The only literary sources on Norse religion come from outsiders, ie Adam of Bremen and Ibn Fadlan, or are centuries removed from the actual practice of Norse religion, ie the Sagas.  The Sagas in particular come in for a hard time when it comes to their accuracy in regards to Norse religious practices.  They were compiled in a specific cultural context (13th century Iceland) and for specific aims (to legitimize and glorify extant Icelandic families for the most part), and not to accurately retell the beliefs of the pre-Christian Norse.  Indeed Iceland had become Christian some two centuries before the Sagas were written down.  For reference, the United States has existed for about 250 years, and religious expression has changed dramatically in the intervening centuries.  Imagine how religious practice might be different in the absence of what we take for granted in religion today such as professional clergy, written scriptures, dedicated houses of worship, and so on. 

What does this mean for your question though?  Mostly that all of our ""common"" conception of Norse beliefs are not really applicable to the Norse people as they actually existed.  This applies to Valhalla as well.  While it might be unlikely that Snorri Sturluson invented Valhalla completely as a part of the Saga compilation, much of his work is infused with Christian influences already, the importance of Balldr as a sacrificial/redemptive figure for example.  Did a Norse warrior in the 9th or 10th centuries have an expectation of going to Valhalla?  Did the people who lived in Scandinavia as farmers despair over the fact that they would never enter Valhalla?  Its really impossible to say, but I find it unlikely they spent a good deal of time worrying over it.  Our understanding of Norse religion is incomplete, and we will never really be able to reconstruct the belief system of the Norse in all of its diverse manifestations."

AskHistorians,"How and why did the ""9/11 was an inside job by the U.S. government"" and ""jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" conspiracy theories gain so much traction and prevalence in the years following 9/11?","It is about two to three years too early to give a full answer to this question, according to the sub rules. While some conspiracy content did appear in Europe from 2001 to 2003, the most important works for popularizing the conspiracy theory in the United States were two online videos. The first, *911: In Plane Site*, was released in 2004, and the second, *Loose Change*, was initially released in 2005 then recut in 2006 and 2007. The rise of the ""9/11 Truth Movement"" as a community can be traced to around 2005 to 2007 (see Michael Butter and Lisa Retterath, ""[From Alerting the World to Stabilizing Its Own Community: The Shifting Cultural Work of the Loose Change Films](https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/cras.40.1.25)"").

One of the directors of *Loose Change*, an Iraq veteran, spoke to [the Washington Post](https://wapo.st/45MxRSC) in 2021 about his sources of inspiration.

> Looking back, Korey could see a fairly straight line between his wartime trauma, the distrust it elicited and the 9/11 Truth conspiracy theories he embraced. He also recalled in particular how “Fahrenheit 9/11,” the 2004 antiwar documentary by Michael Moore, shifted his thinking about the conflicts and his own role in them.

I'm not sure how much else I ought to write here because it seems unfair to provide an answer just to address whatever was bubbling below the surface in 2001-2003. I could try to tie this backwards to earlier conspiracy theories in American history and the impressive cultural power of mainstream media depictions of conspiracy like Oliver Stone's *JFK*, but a lot of the popularity of 9/11 conspiracies in particular comes from the growing feeling of confusion and helplessness about the Iraq War, which is a trend that started after 2003."

AskHistorians,Has a country ever been on the road to fascism and a concerted effort pulled it back from the brink?,"The problem with your query is that it rests a bit on a counter-factual. There is no straightforward road to fascism in any linear sense. Even in interwar Europe, plenty of countries flirted with elements of fascism without going all the way (as it were), and some of those that *did* eventually go all the way ended up at that point due to contingencies rather than inevitabilities. Romania is a good example here in my view – Romanian politics veered sharply to the nationalistic right in the 1930s, leading to a ‘royal dictatorship’ under King Carol II in 1938 that borrowed heavily from fascist methods and ideas (including corporatism), but actively suppressed the main domestic fascist movement, the Iron Guard. It took the upheavals resulting from the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (which saw Romania lose significant territory to the USSR) to topple Carol’s regime, and see it replaced by a more straightforwardly fascistic regime in which the Iron Guard was predominant (which itself was relatively short-lived, replaced by yet another varietal of right-wing authoritarianism with shades of fascism). Your mileage might vary as to exactly when Romania became ‘fascist’ (and when it stopped), but the sheer instability and variability of the situation *after* a far-right takeover points to just how far twisty the path to/around/within fascism could be.

It also hopefully helps demonstrate how far any such answer depends on two bigger questions – first, how specifically you define ‘fascism’ itself (in that different people would place Romania’s descent into fascism at different points) and second, what the best overarching explanation for fascism is. The latter is probably more important here – while we can probably (hopefully) all agree that Romania had a series of unideal governments in the 1930s and 1940s that it would have been nice to avoid, understanding why they were on this path is pretty crucial for understanding how they might have gotten off it.

Perhaps the biggest question here is the classic historian question of structure vs agency. That is, do historical phenomena like the rise of fascism happen because of big, impersonal shifts in political and economic systems (ie without the First World War ending the way it did or the Great Depression happening at the time it did, would, say, Hitler’s rise to power have been possible?)? Or do they hinge more on ideas, contingency and personality – that is, without the specific worldviews, abilities and personalities of Mussolini or Hitler, could fascism have emerged at all, or would it have had fundamentally different characteristics? Most historians would probably not take either view to the extreme, though different schools of thought certainly exist. Marxist historians, for instance, have tended to understand fascism as a broad consequence of the failures of capitalism as a world economic system – capitalists resorting to naked violence to preserve an unstable economic regime on the verge of (socialist) revolution.

The problem is, the more we want to allow the importance of big structural factors, the cloudier the issue gets regarding prevention. I’ve discussed this before in relation to [1930s Britain](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8ssqqv/inspired_by_the_turn_the_western_world_seems_to/e122x1n/) – do we consider the eventual failure of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley as the result of Britain’s relative political stability after the First World War which left little room for radical fascist solutions at home, or because the BUF was effectively throttled (figuratively!) by the active intervention of its opponents? The former undoubtedly has some relevance to understanding the history, but an attitude of ‘eh, it’ll be fine, fascism sorts itself out by itself’ is also not a useful sentiment – if nothing else, active and unopposed fascist movements have a lot of capacity to hurt people even if they ultimately don’t succeed in taking over the system.

With these possible divergences in mind, I’ll try and give some idea of what societies could and couldn’t do to prevent fascism in 1930s Europe. Not all, to be clear, are immediately applicable to other contexts…

# 1. Try not to be poor

Economic insecurity was almost always an important ingredient in the attractiveness of fascism. Not only did things like mass unemployment weaken some of the traditional bastions of left-wing political strength. Trades unions – and therefore most social democratic parties – lose out in particular, since they are generally organised on an industrial basis, and if there are fewer workers in any given industry, the number of union members also drops (as does their bargaining power over wages etc). This in turn fed into the power of less moderate leftist groups (Communists in this era were often significantly better at organising among the unemployed), which in turn heightened the sense of insecurity other social classes felt.

This means that despite the glib subheading, perception is perhaps as important as reality here – particularly for the lower middle classes (the main target demographic for fascist movements), the threat of economic disturbance or revolution that could upset their precarious economic and social status made a movement claiming to offer immediate solutions and security more attractive. This was how Mussolini’s fascists made their start – a willingness to act violently on behalf of landowners and factory managers to ‘restore order’ in the face of the state’s failure to curtail industrial and agrarian unrest in the aftermath of the First World War. In contrast, while places like Britain or the United States didn’t exactly have a *pleasant* economic time in the 1930s, their underlying economic strength meant that they had options to forestall crises. Weaker economies like postwar Italy, or economies heavily exposed to political/diplomatic/trade volatility (as Germany was in 1929), had fewer options available to prevent or mitigate economic crises. The result in these circumstances is what we might think of as the ‘liberal establishment’ in such countries (committed to parliamentary representation, capitalism and so on) was going politically bankrupt. In most of Europe, such politicians never really commanded a mass political following to begin with – they were the parties of middle-class economic elites, and as soon as it became clear that classical liberalism didn’t have the tools needed to navigate severe economic crisis or (seemingly) forestall the threat of socialist revolution, interwar liberals found themselves increasingly marginalised.

AskHistorians,"Lyndon B. Johnson is often perceived as masterful in his ability to persuade or lobby Congress, for example in securing the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Is this reputation deserved, and is he really such an outlier?","I don't have the time or the background to do a statistical analysis on whether you can consider Lyndon Johnson an ""outlier"" in terms of the success of his congressional relations efforts. But I can make the case that he had a remarkable talent for persuasion (both in public and in private), could cultivate important allies, and implement effective strategies. He developed these skills over the course of his lengthy public service career, and it would serve him well when he reached the White House. In my view, his reputation as an effective legislator is well-deserved. In discussing the skills necessary to be effective with Congress  Joseph A. Pika et. al., wrote in their book The Politics of the Presidency

>  No president has ever possessed all of these skills. By most accounts, however, Lyndon Johnson exhibited more than any other modern president, and made the most effective use of his involvement in the legislative process.

LBJ had a gift for persuasion throughout his life. In 1928, he was a university student in San Marcos, Texas. In June of that year, the Democratic Party held its Convention in Houston to nominate Al Smith for President. Johnson's college had a rule prohibiting students from driving outside the San Marcos area, but he convinced a friend to drive him to Houston anyway. Once there, he brandished copies of the the College Star (the student paper) and talked his way into the convention claiming to be a member of the press. When he got back, Dean Alfred Nolle summoned him for a disciplinary meeting over the forbidden trip, but Johnson was so animated about the whole thing that he was able to talk his way out of trouble. Even before he showed up in Congress, he had a gift for getting people to see things his way.

Indeed, it was thanks in part to this ability that he made it to Washington in the first place. In 1930, the young Johnson gave a speech at a local fair on behalf of a politician named Pat Neff, who was running for election to the State Railroad Commission. Neff had once done a favour to Johnson's father, so he gave a good speech for him, which impressed the crowd, among which was a man named Wally Hopkins, who was running for the State Senate. Hopkins put Johnson on his campaign, and later recommended him to newly elected Texas Congressman Richard Kleberg. 

Johnson went to work in Kleberg's office in 1931 and immediately began immersing himself in Washington politics. Congressional staffers at the time had their own debating society, commonly known as ""The Little Congress,"" and Johnson soon became one of its most influential members. He befriended future House Majority Leader (and future Speaker) Sam Rayburn, and the two developed a close relationship. When Johnson wanted to become Director of the Texas branch of the newly created National Youth Administration (NYA) in 1935, Rayburn put in a good word for him with Texas Senator Tom Connally, who passed this on to President Roosevelt, who ultimately gave him the job.

Johnson secured his own election to the House in 1937, winning a special election in the 10th District after the death of incumbent rep. James P. Buchanan. Over the course of his career in the House, he developed a good working relationship with President Roosevelt, something he was able to put to good use in bringing rural electrification to his constituents. The Rural Electrification Administration approved a loan to an electrical co-operative in Johnson's district after he made a presentation to the President himself. 

Outside of his time in the White House and as Vice President, LBJ is of course very well known for his time in the Senate, particularly his tenure as majority leader from 1955 - 1961. Much like everything else, I've touched on in this answer, that's worth a lengthy analysis on its own, but I'll elaborate a bit here. Johnson became leader of the Senate Democrats after a quick ascension up the ranks. He won election to the Senate in 1948, became Democratic Whip in 1951, then leader in 1953 after previous leader Ernest Macfarland lost his seat in 1952. He secured the leadership thanks to the support of Richard Russell of Georgia and Earle Clements of Kentucky, allies he had effectively cultivated. 

It's far too in-depth for a forum like this, but Johnson's 1954 strategy against Senator John Bricker and his isolationist proposal to amend the Constitution is a great example of his ability to manage Senate proceedings. [See here](https://www.cfr.org/blog/twe-remembers-bricker-amendment) for a great overview. Another example is Johnson's management of the 1957 Civil Rights Act. Securing its passage earned Johnson credit but he of course put together a compromise that watered down the already modest law, and even then only secured enough votes by promising Senators from the West Southern support for the Hells Canyon Dam project in Idaho. As a simple piece of legislative maneuvering though, it was a masterstroke.

By the time he became President, LBJ had come to know Washington exceptionally well. His well-known work on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is of course only part of a broad effort across Congress and civil rights activists, but his contribution can't be discounted. It's worth noting that Richard Russell, his onetime patron and later ardent foe on civil rights, once said ""You know, we could have beaten John Kennedy on civil rights, but not Lyndon Johnson."" 

Johnson's lengthy career in Washington before he became President meant that he knew how to manage congressional relations and to achieve significant legislative successes. His administration's work with Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee helped the Social Security Amendments of 1965 succeed in the House, while his effective pressure on Harry Byrd contributed to victory in the Senate, not to mention a good working relationship with Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, which would also be important in securing passage of the Voting Rights Act.

In this answer, I've focused on Johnson's pre-White House career, which I know wasn't what this question wanted addressed. However, I think that by looking at his time in Congress, we can see how he became so effective, which in turn sheds some light on how he was able to put his Congressional skills to good use once he became President."

While you may doubt whether or not Jesus actually did some miracles or exocricism, the fact that his disciples (and probably Jesus himself) believed it is sufficient. 

There are a lot of ""Jesuses"" floating about trying to reconstruct a historical Jesus (which should be noted is different than Jesus from the past). These include(but not limited to) : the moral teacher, apocalyptic prophet, Such portraits an apocalyptic prophet, charismatic healer, Cynic philosopher, Jewish messiah, prophet of social change, and rabbi(copied from Wikipedia for ease) 

Some NT scholars don't see Jesus as having any Godlike attributions (such as those promoted in Jesus Seminar). Some, like Bart Ehrman, have changed their views over time, but still don't think Jesus himself claimed to be divine. Dale Allison thinks Jesus had thoughts of himself as exalted. I agree with this position more than the other 2, but I agree most with the position of Larry Hurtado. 

Hurtado's work focuses on the early worship of Jesus and the early creeds present in the Pauline corpus(7/13 epistles attributes to Paul). Hurtado wants to bring our attention to the way early Christians spoke about Jesus and worshiped him, which includes various hymns such as  Phillipians 2:6-11. Based on such data, some of which can be dated very early, mere months-2 years after the crucifixion, he concludes that Jesus was worshiped as divine shortly after his death. 

Hurtado's method focuses on the beliefs of early Christians, not Jesus per se, but it is reasonable to think that if the disciples though of Jesus as divine, then it is likely that Jesus though so too. 

Scholars mostly thought that high Christology came later (Christology-level of Jesus' divinity), that the Synoptics (GMark, GMatthew and GLuke) didn't have a divine Jesus, and only GJohn did. Iirc that has shifted since even in GMark, which is earliest, you can find allusions to his divinity like calming the storms or walking on water which invokes imagery of  (a) God defeating a watery chaos monster. There is also the ""son of Man"" phrase that's used in Daniel and Jesus probably invokes that title. (sidenote: Son of Man was Jesus' favorite way of addressing himself, and it isn't present much outside the Synoptics so it's probably historical). Those would be some of the reasons for thinking Jesus thought of himself as divine. 

Another approach is analyzing the Second Temple Literature(STJ) and the Dead Sea Scrolls(DSS). In them, you often see an exalted figure, whether that's Enoch, Metatron(some scholars think they're the same person, others don't), Michael, Melhizedek, Wisdom. Based on these data points it isn't inconceivable that Jesuus though of himself as exalted and the Messiah. 

Looking through the DSS we find additional ideas of what a Messiah was supposed to look like. There were different ideas of a Messiah, to be sure. One view is a military commander, king, priest or prophet. Especially telling is 4Q521 which is most explicit and parallels can be found in the episode where Jesus answers John's question if he's the Messiah. 

There's more but these are some main players and data points in the game"
AskHistorians,"The Aztecs had ""Ahuianis"", women entertainers described as very similar to Japanese Geishas. What exactly was life like for these Aztec ""Geishas"" and do they have the same misinterpretation from modern people as Geishas did?","I traced that picture back to [the original artists Deviant Art page](https://www.deviantart.com/kamazotz/art/Aztec-Women-Hairstyles-644201345) where they give their sources as the *Florentine Codex* and Clavijero's *History of Mexico*. I'm not sure what exactly they were citing from Clavijero, but specifically on the topic of Sahagun and *ahuianime* the old friar is very clear in the *Florentine Codex* that these women were not esteemed; less geisha, more streetwalker. 

For instance, his summary of an ahuiani in Book 10 is:

> in auiiani, ca cioatlaueliloc, inacaio ic mauiltiani, nacanamacac, nanacanamacac, ichpuchtlaueliloc, ilamatlaueliloc, tlaoanq̃, xocomicqui, tequixocomicqui, tequitlaoanqui, iellelacic, tlacamicqui, suchimicqui, tlaaltilli, teumicqui, teupoliuhqui, miccatzintli

> The carnal woman is an evil woman who finds pleasure in her body; who sells her body—repeatedly sells her body; an evil young woman [or] an evil old woman, besotted, drunk—very drunk, much besotted; dejected, perverse; [like] a sacrificial victim, a bathed slave, a captive; full of affliction, mortal.

Molina is much more terse in his Nahuatl-Castilian grammar, translating the word simply as ""puta, o mala muger."" English translations (such as Anderson and Dibble) have used terms like ""harlot,"" ""carnal woman,"" or ""pleasure girl,"" though Kartunnen apparently gave the meaning as ""courtesan,"" which may have introduced some confusion to the meaning.

Clendinnen, in (1991) *Aztecs: An Interpretation* notes the term ""ahuiani"" actually derives from ""ahuiya,"" which Molina translates as "" tener lo necessario y estar contento"" and Kartunnen as ""to be happy, content."" The term ""pleasure girls"" or maybe even the old-timey ""good time girls"" might therefore be a fitting epithet. Clendinnen argues that this is too simplistic an interpretation and one fraught with the moralizing of the Christian friars who recorded much of what we know about pre-Hispanic Nahua life. Instead, she suggests that these translation removed from the social context of the ahuianime misses the subtext of ""contentment"" which in her opinion is ""self-indulgence, loose behavior, waste.""

Whereas a dry and chaste Spanish friar might be, um... content, to write off the ahuianime as mere prostitutes and a blight upon proper society, Clendinnen prefers to see them as enmeshed in society. They were neither a virtue nor a vice (though definitely shaded towards the latter), as Nahua attitudes towards sexuality did not map well onto the strict dichotomy of Chistianity. [You might be interested in my prior comment about Tlazolteotl and the concept of sin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kfbl4o/the_aztec_pantheon_had_a_toilet_god_that_tempted/), but the main point here is that the Nahuas accepted natural instincts like sexual lust as just that, natural instincts. It was only when someone overindulged in pleasurable acts -- be they sex or gluttony -- that these innate parts of human life became a problem. To paraphrase a famous passage on Nahua philosophy, the proper life was seen as a narrow, jagged mountain path, with steep, slippery slopes on either side; it required discipline and dedication to navigate successfully.

A poem/song from the *Cantares Mexicanos* is illustrative of the ideas above. Attributed to Tlaltecatzin, a ruler of Cuauhchinanco, Leon-Portilla interprets the work as the nobleman having a conversation with an ahuiani he spotted in the city (or at least having a conversation with himself about the woman). It's a classic example of the near universal genre of an elite man spotting a lower class woman who he deprecates and objectifies, but also fiercely desires. Ultimately though, he decides he has important elite-man things to do and continues on his way. In an early part though, the writer gushes over the ahuiani. From Leon-Portilla's translation:

> el florido cacao está espumoso,

> la bebida que con flores embriaga.

> Yo tengo anhelo,

> lo saborea mi corazón,

> se embriaga mi corazón,

> en verdad mi corazón lo sabe:

> ¡Ave roja de cuello de hule!,

> fresca y ardorosa,

> luces tu guirnalda de flores.

> ¡Oh madre!

> Dulce, sabrosa mujer,

> preciosa flor de maíz tostado

Whoa momma, indeed! This is a man enraptured by the sensuality of a woman, but he puts such thoughts aside and denies the ephemerality of the pleasure she offers.

> Aquí tú has venido,

> frente a los príncipes,

> tú, maravillosa criatura,

> nvitas al placer.

> Sobre la estera de plumas amarillas y azules

> aquí estás erguida.

> Preciosa flor de maíz tostado,

> sólo te prestas,

> serás abandonada,

> tendrás que irte,

> quedarás descarnada.

And finally we come to his self-admonishment and reminding himself of the dangers of unchecked indulgence.

> Si mi corazón lo gustara,

> mi vida se embriagaría.

> Cada uno está aquí,

> sobre la tierra,

> vosotros señores, mis príncipes,

> si mi corazón lo gustara,

> se embriagaría.

> Yo sólo me aflijo,

> digo:

> que no vaya yo

> al lugar de los descarnados.

> Mi vida es cosa preciosa.

I want to bring specific attention to that penultimate line in the quote, about the ""place of the emaciated."" Nahuas envisioned male sexual energy as somewhat finite, and therefore it was unwise to spend their precious bodily fluids freely, lest they dry out and grow weak. Female sexuality had no such limitations though, and there's a famous story of two older women brought to judgement for their proclivities with a couple of young priests. Nezahualcoyotl, presiding over the court, asked them, ""are you not satiated, as old as you are?"" to which the women replied with a hearty rebuttal, saying:

> you men, you are sluggish, you are depleted... it is all gone. There is no more... but we who are women, we are not the sluggish ones. In us there is a cave, a gorge, who's only function is to await that which is given, whose only function is to receive.

Putting aside the patriarchal assumptions of female genitalia as built only ""to receive,"" that is an unapologetic proclamation of women's sexuality. The Aztecs, however, were a patriarchal society and while they did not deny the sexual desires of women, they saw it through the lens of the danger it posed to young men if they discovered all the hot MILFs in their altepetl. They might waste their vital energy in debauchery, rather than focusing it on the proper activity of a man: warfare."

AskHistorians,"In 1977, General Hackett and others wrote a ""future history"" book, The Third World War, taking place in a near future 1985. How plausible were the assumptions made in its setup?","Regarding Italy, the scenario looked *plausible* in 1977, but not necessarily *likely*. u/Alvisefalier has some background on the PCI (Italian Communist Party) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jcfrrg/how_close_was_italy_of_joining_the_warsaw_pact/g96s64z/).

1977 in particular came on the heels of the 1976 Italian elections, which saw the PCI come in at a close second behind the Christian Democrats (34.37% of the vote and 228 deputies out of 630, compared to the Christian Democrats' 38.71% and 262 deputies). There was a widespread fear among non-communists that the PCI would form a government and change Italian foreign policy stances, but this never really was a likely outcome - other Italian political parties formed a government with the Christian Democrats, and the PCI ended up providing external support briefly, before returning to the opposition (and lost seats in the 1979 election after the crises involving terrorist attacks by the Red Brigades in 1978 and 1979). 

For what its worth, from the late 1970s Western European communist parties (including PCI) adopted ""eurocommunism"", which was stance that largely distanced themselves from the Soviet Union and Soviet foreign policies. Interestingly, the French Communist Party (PCF) consistently got over 20% of the vote in legislative elections in the 1960s and 1970s and ended up contributing ministers to the French Government in 1981-1983 (despite losing seats and votes heavily to the Socialists in 1981), and this didn't really change French foreign policy much under Mitterand.

Depending on the details, the African example....sounds kind of like what actually happened? The Marxist-Leninist MPLA formed a pro-Soviet government in Angola, and was supported with 36,000 Cuban troops in its civil war against UNITA (which was backed by South Africa, which invaded Angola in 1975). Mozambique likewise achieved independence under the Marxist-Leninist FRELIMO (and received substantial support from the USSR and Eastern Bloc), which became embroiled in a civil war against the South African-supported RENAMO. Zambia, Botswana and Mozambique also provided refuge and material support to the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO), and this led to South African commando raids in these countries in the 1980s."
AskHistorians,"Why are some colours common as surnames, whereas others [are] absolutely not?","Surnames were introduced to England (and the English language) with the Norman conquest, first among nobles and then spreading through the other classes. By 1400 or so most English people had adopted surnames. In general most English language surnames are either patronymics, occupations, locations, or descriptions of the original bearer. So we get Johnson, Smith, Hill and Short, among many other examples.

The surnames you identified all fit these categories. Brown, Black, and White refer to physical attributes of a person (hair colour or complexion). Green doesn’t refer to the colour but the place (a green is an open grassy area). Grey refers to physical attributes again (hair), but may also be due to place names. A knight from the area of Graye-sur-Mer in Normandy is the founder of the noble house of Grey, of which the most famous member is probably Lady Jane Grey, the Nine Days Queen. Though the second Earl Grey, from whom we get the tea, may also be a contender. Some non-noble Greys would be descended from this family. 

You missed the names Reed/Read/Reid on your list, which come from the colour red (Anglo Saxon rēad) and referred to someone with a red complexion or red hair. 

This brings up the other part of your question, why not blue, orange, purple, yellow. 

Blue, Purple and Yellow are all real if rare surnames. Blue tends to be a modern translation from German or French where it is more common, referring either to someone’s eye colour, someone who made blue dye or who wore blue clothes. Purple also tends to be translated, from Italian, and come from the occupation of making purple dye. Yellow would refer to hair colour, though the usual old English word for the hair colour we would call yellow was fair (fæger) so the name Fairfax for example comes in closer to a description name for “yellow” hair. 

Now on to Orange. One of my favourite etymology facts of all time is that the colour orange in English is actually named after the fruit (from Sanskrit naranga then by way of Persian, Arabic, Italian and French into the orange we know and love) not the other way around! It is first recorded as a colour word in the 1510s. Prior to that English didn’t really recognize orange as a separate colour from red. Hence why robins have red breasts and people have red hair when to modern eyes those colours are not red. Since this colour word came into English after most people had adopted surnames, this is why the surname Reed/Reid/Read would refer to a red headed or ginger haired person not Orange.

As a side note Orange is famously the house name for the Dutch royal family (and thus a patriotic colour for Dutch sports). That name comes from the city of Orange in France, which gave its name to the County of Orange, and later Principality of Orange which has been part of the hereditary holdings of the Dutch crown since the 1500s. That town’s name comes from proto-Celtic word Arausio that became Aurengia to the Romans, and then Orange. All of which has nothing to do with the colour orange at all! Or the Arabic word for the fruit that gives us the colour name. The words have just come to have the same spelling in French (and English) over the years, as happens to words when humans decide to organize them and make them fit rules."
AskHistorians,"How did ""kamehameha"", the main attack from the Japanese anime franchise Dragon Ball, come to be named after a Hawaiian royal dynasty?","The “kamehameha” move is an unintentional insult to Hawaii, by means of colonialist South Seas romance.

Japan’s relationship with the South Pacific begins with pre-1600 trade which remains to this day murky and poorly researched. We know that there were wealthy Japanese merchants and samurai living in the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Java, and that they were bringing home goods and technology which became widely used. After all these men were ordered back to Japan (and some Japanese women were left stranded in Batavia), the South Pacific became the home of romance, a mysterious, inaccessible region with uninhabited islands, strange tribes, and an “island full of women” who had never seen a man. 

This image never really went away, even into the 20th century as Japan became acquainted with the real peoples of the Pacific Ocean. In 1919, Japan was awarded possession of some South Pacific islands formerly claimed by Germany. This only intensified the imagery of the South Seas (Nan’yō) as a place full of barbarism and romance, and period stories about Japan’s possessions framed them in this way. This was of course temporarily interrupted by World War II, but after 1945 the romance continued. It has a long-reaching legacy; for example, Daijiro Morohoshi's 1975 manga *Mud Men* is a Lovecraftian disruption of South Seas tropes, and Hayao Miyazaki has said that *Mud Men* inspired some of his character designs in *Princess Mononoke*.

In 1976, Japan’s public broadcaster, the NHK, aired a children’s song called “Hamehameha, King of the Southern Island.” Here is a full synopsis. The king of a certain southern island, Hamehameha, is a dreamer whose heart sings of the stars and seas. His wife, also named Hamehameha, is a sleepyhead who wakes up after sunrise and falls sleep before sunset. His children, also named Hamehameha, always skip school even when there is just rain or wind. In the final verse, we learn everyone on the island is named Hamehameha so that they don't have to put the effort into learning a bunch of different names. You may see illustrations and music videos of this song by googling 南の島のハメハメハ大王 ([some](http://ww6.tiki.ne.jp/~danpane/sakuhin/seisaku_panel/hamehameha.html) are rather racist by Western standards, [others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVNJWHCXAnI) are more enjoyable).

The punchline of this song is that Pacific people are lazy and Kamehameha is a funny name. The former is an extremely common stereotype which is based in the fact that when Europeans tried to colonize the Southeast Asian archipelagos, the natives would often uproot themselves to avoid corvée labor; there is a book about it, *The Myth of the Lazy Native: A Study of the Image of the Malays, Filipinos and Javanese from the 16th to the 20th Century and Its Function in the Ideology of Colonial Capitalism* by Syed Alatas. The use of Kamehameha's name is more lighthearted, *hamu* in Japanese being an old word for eating, so hame-hame-ha sounds like “nom nom nom” or something. Although Japan did, uh, bomb Hawaii once, they had no feelings of malice towards the Hawaiian royal family, who had once appealed to the Emperor of Japan to be rescued from the American colonialists.

When Akira Toriyama’s wife suggested in 1984 that Goku’s signature move be called “Kamehameha”, she was almost certainly thinking of the Hamehameha song alongside the actual Hawaiian king. She herself said that it sounded like a stupid name for a power move and therefore appropriate for Master Roshi’s repertoire. (edit: Master Roshi's nickname in Japanese is Kame Sen'nin, so it's an old-man style pun. Thanks to the commenter who reminded me...) Dragon Ball is full of silly names with no harm intended towards actual trunks, bloomers, piccolos, cauliflower, or other such mundane objects. On the other hand, if the children's song hadn’t existed, the name of a foreign king probably would not have sounded quite so ridiculous to Japanese ears. The song had, I think unintentionally, merged together real Hawaiian political history with silly fantasy.

I don’t think Toriyama or his wife dislike the Hawaiian people, and the name is intended in good humor. However, the South Seas romance took on fairly racist connotations in the colonial period, which had not quite faded away when the images of the South Seas returned to distant romance in the postwar period, and that's the historical context behind Kamehameha sounding ""ridiculous""."

AskHistorians,Why do neo-Nazis and White supremacists deny the Holocaust? (please read for the question in-depth),"First of all, thank you for asking this question here and taking the care, as you noted above, not to go to extremist sources for your answers.

u/swarthmoreburke has already done a great job describing broader ignorance of the Holocaust in its immediate aftermath (rightly shouting out Deborah Lipstadt as a titan of the field). I am going to take a slightly different tack and address at greater length the development of neo-Nazi thought over the last century-ish (with heavy reliance on Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke’s[ *Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity*)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/black-sun-aryan-cults-esoteric-nazism-and-the-politics-of-identity/oclc/47665567). Before we get started, please remember that racism inherently flows from false premises. Searching for logic within racist thought is always going to take nasty twists and turns because it begins with such the illogical premise of racial superiority. Stay cautious, stay skeptical.

Holocaust denial by neo-Nazis and other white supremacists is a means to justify violence against Jewish people and support the specious argument that Jewish people are allegedly masterminding the destruction of white people. White supremacy and neo-Nazism basically boils down to one theme: demographic anxiety about supposedly-declining white populations, and conspiracy theorism that places Jewish people at the top of a shadowy hierarchy trying to “mongrelize” or “water down” superior white genetics. In their words, neo-Nazis hate Jewish people because they \*blame\* Jewish people for supposedly masterminding the alleged demise of white superiority (all nonsense, but this is generally the belief). For them, the Holocaust is not a celebration of white triumph over supposed Jewish evil, but a cudgel that Jewish people allegedly wield to beat down white people, prevent them from saying “the truth” about supposed Jewish control over the world, and the alleged Jewish plot to eradicate white people. Denying the Holocaust and downplaying it (and inverting discussion of the Holocaust to frame it as an \*attack\* on white people) is itself a justification for violence against Jewish people - violence neo-Nazis already want to commit. Although outside the scope of this sub because they’re too recent, almost all white supremacist mass killings have cited fear of white population decline as central to their motives. Denying the Holocaust therefore supports the larger goal of dehumanizing Jewish people (which serves the broader goal of dehumanizing all non-white people) and justifying further violence against them (again, Goodrick-Clarke’s *Black Sun* is probably a good place to start if you want to delve deeper).

Neo-Nazis in the 1950s emphasized fears that non-white people were intermixing with white populations and were “watering down” the essential character of white people. To maximize fear in potential converts to the ideology, neo-Nazi leaders would make this demographic anxiety personal - they would try to get interested people to believe they and their families were the specific targets of a plot to reduce the white birth rate (see Raphael Ezekiel’s 1995[ *The Racist Mind: Portraits of American Neo-Nazis and Klansmen*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/31660490)). Generalized fear of population degradation and conviction in some version of genetic superiority was already mainstream in the United States and Europe in the early 1900s. Debates surrounding marriage equality, segregation, and eugenics all emphasized these themes (all rich topics in their own right -[ this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xm7le3/watching_ken_burns_the_us_and_the_holocaust_and_i/) is a good place to start on eugenics, also see[ *Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America*](https://worldcat.org/title/56490986) by Alexandra Minna Stern). So, the basic concept that certain types of genetics needed to be perfected and protected from degradation was mainstream even in academic circles at the end of World War II. As detailed below, the main difference for white power advocates, including neo-Nazis, was to outline a Jewish conspiracy they claimed was masterminding the supposed decline of white people - applying a mainstream idea to their extremist convictions to justify violence. For them, if Jewish people were behind the eradication of white people, then any attacks on Jewish people become permissible.

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, neo-Nazis who played up their hero worship of Adolf Hitler encountered difficulty in attracting recruits from other white supremacist circles. Transitioning to a focus on demographic anxieties (and, subsequently, anti-Communism to capitalize on Cold War identity politics) became the neo-Nazi strategy to find purchase in the broader white power movement (see Kathleen Belew,[ *Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286078) for more on that convergence and Leonard Zeskind’s[ *Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/blood-and-politics-the-history-of-the-white-nationalist-movement-from-the-margins-to-the-mainstream/oclc/243544894)). Klan members and more mainstream white supremacists rejected the use of Nazi symbols in part because so many of them fought for the United States in World War II. Years of anti-war propaganda left negative associations with Nazi imagery for veterans of World War II even if they accepted the basic tenets of white supremacy and distrust of Jewish people. Keep in mind that the draft was still very much in use - those men did not fight in Europe because they wanted to save Jewish lives, but because they were ordered to do so as conscripts to the U.S. military. In fact, U.S. propaganda at the time heavily played up racist imagery of its own to motivate U.S. soldiers. The ideal of protecting white women was a constant theme of World War I and World War II propaganda, and “housewife populism” became a major element of the postwar American conservative movement. White supremacists of all stripes capitalized on the popularity of the idea to underscore their desire to maximize the white birth rate - a task for which white women are obviously indispensable. On this topic, see Kathleen Blee,[ *Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_of_the_Klan.html?id=U6gwDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description) and Michelle Nickerson,[ *Mothers of Conservatism: Women and the Postwar Right*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691163918/mothers-of-conservatism)). The theme of protecting white women became the central theme of white power advocates and neo-Nazis, rather than primarily the hatred of Jewish people. This observation should in no way excuse anti-Semitism among neo-Nazis, but it should emphasize how anti-Semitism and Holocaust is a justification for violence rather than a means to an end by itself.

Neo-Nazism through the 1960s and 1970s sought to stoke fears of “personal annihilation” in young, white men and women (the phrase is borrowed from Raphael Ezekiel’s 1995[ *The Racist Mind: Portraits of American Neo-Nazis and Klansmen*](https://www.worldcat.org/title/31660490)). These demographic anxieties also remained constant in mainstream conservative politics, normalizing the fears and reducing the intellectual work neo-Nazis and other white power advocates needed to do to win converts to their cause (see Nickerson, *Mothers of Conservatism* and Belew, *Bring the War Home*). As neo-Nazis became more deeply enmeshed in broader white power movement networks throughout the 1960s and 1970s, they increasingly emphasized anti-Communism as a driving theme for their ideology - but identifying Jewish people as the architects of global Communism. Anti-Communism, and corresponding anti-Semitism, also was intimately tied to demographic anxiety and the need to increase the white birth rate (see Goodrick-Clarke, *Black Sun*, Belew, *Bring the War Home*, and Zeskind *Blood and Politics* for a more thorough exploration of the topic).

AskHistorians,"Before the early 1900s why did everyone dress so impractically, sometimes in suit pants, a waistcoat and button up shirt for activities such as tree felling, construction, etc?","I'm going to start with something a little different, just to illustrate a general point: women's tennis. Specifically, when women's tennis was first started in the 1870s. [Here is a video from British Pathe in 1938](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_lxaoFQt6I&t=4s) with a recreation of 1870s tennis. The dresses were, well, heavy. As the narrator says, ""there was none of the dash of the modern game"", and women's fashion in tennis by the 1930s [was more like this](https://imgur.com/a/3Lp5Gbm) (picture from Smith College, 1930). (The film’s dresses are a little off and the bonnets are a few decades off, but the gameplay is right.)

With a modern eye, the original game might seem almost comical, but keep in mind the cultural context was to emphasize grace, not athleticism. Women just wore their normal dresses. From the 1873 published rules (as written by a man, Walter Wingfield):

>They are graceful and gentle; they have spirit and enthusiasm; and in tennis, as in other things, they stimulate man to do his best ...  If they fight against you, what winsome, if not winning, adversaries!

Even by 1900, when women's tennis was a sport at the Olympics, there were still dresses at the court. There was no _practical_ reason to cling to dresses, just like there is no practical reason modern women's tennis-wear sometimes embraces a dress-like look. There was both cultural inertia and the over-imposition of expected standards of women's behavior.

Similarly, when judging clothes worn by laborers of the 1800s, it is tempting to simply try to draw a concrete reason for all those _layers_, but don't underestimate the sheer power of cultural inertia.

...

Let's next try to calibrate how we look at pictures of the 19th century, both in the way they would have viewed them, and what things might be invisible.

[This](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/8f/c5/078fc559b81b8115be3f95fc09def4fd.jpg) is high-class-ware for the late-19th century eye: suits. In the late 1800s they are tailor-made for bodies (1930s is when ""baggier"" suits became acceptable). Generally speaking it was a marker of one of the upper classes if you routinely wore one, and you were not supposed to be diving into the muck. 

Not only was the working class shorter than the middle class (by about 6 inches) their clothes indicated their position. One 14 year old (Elizabeth Fanshawe) with working class roots won a scholarship for High School and on her first day she was made to stand in front of the entire class to have the errors in her clothing pointed out.

>It was my first encounter with the ""class"" society; the types of clothing one wore was far more important than one's academic achievement.

For workers, they had something like [this 1874 picture of carpenters](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-carpenters-at-work-building-two-houses-ca-1874-50051596.html?imageid=E427E459-26E4-4354-B130-9ABCA9BEDC90&p=167342&pn=1&searchId=cffe0eb46d56781d69f9d6001f9ac734&searchtype=0), with them wearing overalls. Or [this picture from around 1900](https://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12/life01_jd_13oct_2rail-1.jpg), in New Mexico.

Context when evaluating old pictures of clothing is important. [Perhaps you might be thinking of a picture like this one](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-golden-spike-ceremony-1869-135041278.html?imageid=B26CC9AF-76D7-480C-BDB7-852B66BC5493&p=52089&pn=1&searchId=9ed91a533c453604aeea91b86a554c9f&searchtype=0), but: this is not showing workers in progress. This is a golden spike ceremony of the completion of the transatlantic railroad (railroad directors and officers were engraved on the sides); there were hundreds of guests there. [This is a more realistic photo of an actual railroad in progress](https://imgur.com/a/6WKW6PQ) (Union Pacific Railroad Construction, 1868, photograph by A. J. Russell). Even so, the working class would try hard in the context of the public eye (which includes photography) to look ""respectable"".

Also keep in mind this was not, for the working poor, one outfit of a large wardrobe, one new one every day. There was a lot of re-use of a particular garment, that might need to last a long time; quoting the 1914 book _How the Other Half Lives_:

>There is no Monday cleaning in the tenements. It is wash-day all the week round, for a change of clothing is scarce among the poor. They are poverty's honest badge, these perennial lines of rags hung out to dry, those that are not the washerwoman's professional shingle.

In a study of a manufacturing town, the author Lady Bell talked to a worker who bought a ""so-called flannel shirt"" that had disintegrated in 3 days, so had to resort to buying an old army shirt from the pawnbroker, where two of them was enough to last for an entire year.

Lady Bell also noted that work at the local iron plant was ""ruinous"" to any clothing, and that a person in general might wear ""a greasy, torn old coat with holes in it, patched trousers, frayed at the edge, tied tightly below the knee"" with the intent of changing when not working.

Having said that, you may still ask: why all those layers? It is true that it is not unusual to find rolled-up sleeves (you can spot one rolled but not the other in the Union Pacific picture). There is quite a bit of evidence of improvisation. The journalist James Greenwood in England was watching over 200 people working on a railway in 1867, and noted some of them were bare-chested; others wore ""red smocks, blue smocks, and white smocks"" (the modern smock is mostly associated with painters, but it wasn't uncommon for workers in dirty professions). Or consider the invention of the T-shirt, which happened in the 1880s when British miners and longshoremen took long johns and cut them separately into pants and shirts; the knit top was able to stretch with the body.

To summarize

a.) cultural inertia was very strong so improvisations like the t-shirt took a long time to develop; it didn't really become acceptable as outer-ware (outside the confines of the work shift) until the 1950s

b.) 19th century standards of formality were different, with heavy expectation of clothing to reflect the respectability of one's family; even for the working class, there was an sense of needing any facing in public to keep up appearances

c.) during actual work the workers sometimes improvised, but there would have been active avoidance of such things appearing on camera (a good analogy would be [how obscenity was common in private in the era, but was avoided in print](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sodkmb/obscene_curse_words_were_extraordinarily_rare_in/hwb47ua/) and in front of ""fragile ears"")

AskHistorians,Why didn't Japan surrender after the first atomic bombing?,"Nagasaki was bombed only 3 *days*, not a week, after Hiroshima  due to the weather. The Hiroshima bomb had resulted in all communications being lost with the city, so the Japanese command had to send people to determine the situation. They had just received confirmation that the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was an atomic bomb and was in the middle of a meeting about it (and the Soviets invasion of Manchuria) when the bomb on Nagasaki was dropped. Truman likewise seem not to have known about the timing of the second bomb. Please see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2zw1kj/was_truman_surprised_by_the_nagasaki_bombing/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/smsdeh/could_have_japan_surrendered_in_only_three_days/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13ollfb/why_was_nagasaki_bombed_so_shortly_3_days_after/) by Dr. Alex Wellerstein (/u/restricteddata). Given our surviving sources it seems Nagasaki played very little in the final Japanese decision to surrender, unlike Hiroshima and the Soviet declaration of war. So you could very well say the Japanese *did* surrender after Hiroshima, just the US bombed Nagasaki before Japan made its decision, which took the emperor to actively push for surrender and resulted in an aborted coup before the decision was made public on August 15.

AskHistorians,Where there any 'could-have-been' cradles of civilization that by unfortunately weren't?,"I don't mean this as a criticism, but it is interesting how this is framed as ""unfortunate""--not just by you, it is ubiquitous to talk about these questions as ones of ""missed opportunities"" or ""dead ends"" or the like. There could be a question if civilization as such is something that is inherently desirable and not developing in those lines is a failure--but of course that is a totally different question. I am also not trying to say that is what *you* are implying, just flagging that as an interesting point.

That aside, there is a strict geographic way of approaching this question made most famous to the general public by Jared Diamond, looking at underlying natural conditions like climate, preexisting flora and fauna, waters, etc and then builds that out to describe the underling conditions that create civilization. That isn't a bad way of looking at it per se and if any geographer wants to chime in then they should feel free, but it does create a certain just-so narrative, a jump from effect to cause so to speak. Also there is a question of whether the diversity of the so called cradles of civilization (like the highlands of Peru and the river basins of of Mesopotamia) is actually more striking than any universal features.

But another way of looking at it is to look at cases where ""civilization"" as such did develop but it did not stick--a ""false start"" to use the framing of the first paragraph. The most well known example is probably the so called ""Old Europe"", roughly modern southeast Europe before about 3000 BCE. This is a series of archaeologically defined cultures that shares many features with the well known ""cradle of civilization"" in Mesopotamia, such as the high volume production of metal goods, extensive trade routes and a seemingly common cultural mesh extending over a wide area, and cities (or at least something quite like cities)--only earlier, and clearly unrelated. To make a long story short, this culture collapsed and was replaced by a very different form of culture in a process that is almost certainly related to the spread of Indo-European languages. This is not the only example either--the Sintashta culture of the Urals, for example, is a case where a more sedentary pattern of settlement was replaced by a more mobile one (perhaps related to the development of the chariot).

It is also worth talking about the Mississippi and the Amazon here, because it is very easy to take a purely detached and mechanical view of these things. Those are two cases of large fertile river valleys thickly settled by complex urban sites before a collapse and transition to different lifeways. Only in those cases we know perfectly well what caused it--even if the Mississippi may have experienced a collapse before 1492, the ultimate fate of both urban civilizations at the hands of European disease and imperial expansion is well known. This is often talked about as ""history interrupted"" but it is worth keeping in mind that such ""interruptions"" also happened in the other cases mentioned, but because we lack history for them it is much easier to view it as more impersonal and mechanistic."
AskHistorians,The Bible rarely mentions physical descriptions of its characters. Was this lack of physical descriptions a staple of ancient literature or is this only seen in the Bible? And when did that trend change to the long physical character descriptions we see today in literature?,"The lack of physical descriptions is absolutely the norm in ancient literature.

There are some exceptions. They fall into two main groups:

(a) Physiognomic descriptions: these are clustered in the 2nd century CE. Their most famous exemplars are Suetonius' descriptions of the Caesars in his 'twelve Caesars'; more directly relevant, but also more obscure, are the descriptions in the *Physiognomonika* by the sophist Polemon, who had close ties to Hadrian. The original text of Polemon's treatise doesn't survive, but we have a 14th century Arabic translation, a 3rd century Greek paraphrase, and heavy use of it in a 4th century Latin treatise.

(b) Identificatory descriptions: this is group goes back to antiquity but didn't begin to permeate literary genres until the 6th century CE *Chronography* by Ioannes Malalas. The *Chronography* contains a large number of descriptive portraits of a wide variety of people, ranging from emperors to legendary figures like Helen and Achilleus, focusing on things like hair and skin colour. It's suspected that Malalas' portraits grew out of a tradition attested in documentary papyri of physical descriptions used to identify people for legal purposes, for taxation, for identifying soldiers, or for tracking runaway slaves.

The second group has been more carefully studied than the first, by J. Fürst in [a 1902 paper](https://zenodo.org/record/2291587), and by Elizabeth and Michael Jeffreys in a chapter of the 1990 book *Studies in John Malalas*. Malalas' literary adaptation of the 'identificatory' genre isn't based in reality in any way, it's purely a literary conceit designed to create an impression of verisimilitude. The lengthiest sequence of portraits is in book 5 of the *Chronography*, where Malalas gives a catalogue of descriptions of the heroes in the Trojan War: here's a sample (tr. Jeffreys, Jeffreys, and Scott) --

> Agamemnon was large, fair-skinned, with a good nose, a bushy beard, black hair and large eyes; he was well-educated, magnanimous and noble.

> Menelaos was short, with a good chest, powerful, with ruddy skin, a good nose, good features, a bushy beard, fairish hair and wine-coloured eyes; he was a bold fighting man.

> Achilles had a good chest, fair skin, a large massive body, curly hair, a thin beard, fair, thick hair, with a long nose, and wine-coloured eyes; he was quick, skilled in jumping, well-built and magnanimous; he was pleasure-loving, charming and a fierce fighting man.

> Patroklos was stout, powerful, of medium height, with a good face, good eyes, fairish hair, fair to ruddy skin and a good beard; he was noble and a strong fighting man.

And so on for several pages. It should be obvious, if you are at all familiar with the material we have relating to the Trojan War, that this is all totally invented. So far as we know, it's Malalas' own invention (given that he includes similar portraits of historical figures elsewhere in his *Chronography* too).

This isn't anywhere near the Bible, which you mention in your question. But it's the kind of thing we have. I say the second group is better studied, but that isn't saying a lot: there's very little scholarship on these physical descriptions."
AskHistorians,Why did Churchill intervene to save Coco Chanel from execution?,"More can always be said, but here's my [previous answer to this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/w4jmo4/why_did_winston_churchill_personally_intervene_in/), plus some [background](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mees4j/when_coco_chanel_made_her_comeback_in_the_50s/) on Chanel's wartime activities. In a nutshell: 1) the Churchill connexion is from third-hand testimony (something Chanel allegedly told her maid who reported it to Chanel's grand-niece; not impossible but still highly speculative), 2) as iffy her collaborationist activities were, she was *not* a Gestapo spy and was *not* responsible for the death of French people (or at least such serious accusations never emerged), and 3) the violent extrajudicial ""purges"" of the late 1944, early 1945 were not ordered by de Gaulle, and court-based *épuration* proceedings started when France had a running government again. She wisely chose to flee France for a decade, but even if she had been tried, she would have received a slap on the wrist, like many other low-level collaborators, or even been let go if she could find Resistance members to vouch for her (not very difficult for somebody like her; much worse people were acquitted and resumed their careers)."

AskHistorians,How successful were 'Maroon' communities of escaped slaves in the United States?,"While this is a large question it can be partially answered by looking at the marooned communities living within the Great Dismal Swamp on the southeastern border of Virginia and northeastern part of North Carolina. Within the confines of the swamp, marooned communities comprised of escaped slaves, Native Americans, and others lived freely starting in the early stages of European colonization of North America to the end of the civil war. 

During the 17th to 18th century, the Swamp was about the size of the state of Delaware, though efforts to drain it over the years has reduced its current day size dramatically. Nonetheless, its size and location provided a natural land barrier that made travel through it difficult, dangerous, and in some parts downright impossible. 

This geographic harshness allowed the marooned communities within the Swamp to become well established. Indeed so much so that some escaped slaves saw their destination on the Underground Railroad not as the North or to Canada but to the Swamp itself where they could live hidden from white enslavers. Within these communities, there were marriages, childbirths, and families who built permanent homes, cultivated gardens, and raised livestock. There was trade, hunting, and even evidence that communities took part in leisure activities.

Compared to the maroon communities in parts of the Caribbean, Central, and South America, the Swamp was generally smaller in terms of population and power. However their mere survival in such a geographical harsh landscape, in the middle of a fierce slave trade, under no white subjugation, is testament in and of itself to high levels of organization and itself a form of power. Certainly, there is little record to indicate the marooned communities in the Swamp collaborated with enslaving powers. 

The end of the maroon communities in the Swamp began with the Civil War, where many inhabitants left to fight for the North. Once Northern victory had been secured, the need to maroon and stay hidden from the enslaving structures of the South began to disappear. 

Over the course of decades, much has been forgotten about the marooned communities who lived in the Swamp. Recent archaeological digs within the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge have uncovered valuable artifacts that shed light on who lived there and what their life was like. Even with these discoveries, there is still much that is unknown.

AskHistorians,"I’ve heard many examples in history where underage girls were forced to marry adult men, but are their any examples of the opposite happening? Like underage boys being forced to marry adult women?","One example that springs to mind right away is the king of Sicily and future Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who was 14 years old in 1209 when he married Constance of Aragon, whose was probably about twice his age.

So how did this happen? Well first we have to go back to 1154, when king Roger II of Sicily died. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, William I. However, Roger II also had other sons who died before him, including one also named Roger. This younger Roger (who had died in 1148) had an illegitimate son named Tancred. Roger II also left behind a pregnant wife, and his posthumous daughter, Constance, was born later in 1154. William I ruled Sicily until his death in 1166, when he was succeeded by his son William II, who ruled until 1189.

William II had no children, so Constance was his closest legitimate heir. She had married the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI, a few years earlier in 1186. But the nobles of Sicily, and the Pope, were worried about the imbalance of power if the Emperor also inherited the Kingdom of Sicily through Constance. In 1189, the kingdom was seized by her bastard nephew Tancred, until he died in 1194. Tancred’s son, William III, was still a child, so Constance easily overthrew him and took back the kingdom, which, as far as she was concerned, was rightfully hers.

Constance was pregnant at the time and in December 1194 she gave birth to Frederick. When Frederick was still only 2 years old in 1197, his father emperor Henry died, but once again neither the Sicilian nor German nobles, nor the Pope, wanted one person to control both the Empire and Sicily. They forced Constance to give up Frederick’s claim to the Empire. Unfortunately Constance also died the next year in 1198, leaving Frederick an orphan. The church felt it was the special protector of orphans, and this orphan could potentially be the most powerful ruler in Europe, so the new pope, Innocent III, promised to be Frederick’s foster father and took the entire kingdom of Sicily under his protection as a “papal fief.” Of course, Innocent would be affected the most if Frederick inherited both Sicily, in southern Italy, and the Empire, which included much of northern Italy - the Papal States, in the middle, would then be surrounded. Innocent wanted to prevent that outcome.

The Empire ended up in a civil war for almost Innocent’s entire papacy, which suited him just fine. Meanwhile he made sure Frederick was educated and fit to rule Sicily, and this included arranging a marriage for him. Marrying a German princess would not work - that would just end up in the same situation as Constance and Henry. Instead, Innocent made an alliance with the king of Aragon, Pedro II, who sent his sister - also named Constance.

Constance of Aragon’s date of birth is not known exactly but she was probably born around 1184, as she married king Emeric of Hungary around 1199 when she was about 14 or 15. She would have been too young to marry if she was born after that, but she could have been born a few years earlier, and may have been about 20 when she married Emeric. Emeric died in 1204, their infant son Laszlo died in 1205, and Emeric’s brother Andrew became king of Hungary. Constance returned to Aragon and a few years later Pedro II and Innocent III arranged a second marriage for her, with Frederick.

They married in August 1209 when Frederick was still 14 and she was probably at least 25 or maybe 30 or so. In 1211 they had a son, named Henry after Frederick’s father. He was their only child.

Meanwhile, the civil war in Germany had ended up with two rival claimants. One, Philip of Swabia, was assassinated in 1208 by the other claimant, Otto of Brunswick. But Otto was unpopular and the German nobles who elected the king of Germany wanted to choose Frederick instead, which they did in 1212 when Frederick turned 18. Otto was overthrown in 1215, but it took another few years before Frederick could be properly elected king of Germany in 1220, and then ultimately crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by the new pope, Honorius III (Frederick’s foster father Innocent III died in 1216).

Constance of Aragon was now Frederick’s empress, but she died not long afterwards in 1221. In 1225 Frederick married again, but this time the situation was reversed. He was now about 30, and his new wife, queen Isabella II of Jerusalem, was only 13. Isabella died in childbirth only 2 years later at the age of 15. Their son, Conradin, ended up claiming Sicily, the Empire, and Jerusalem, which caused all sorts of problems and warfare all across the Mediterranean, but that is a different story…

So, this is perhaps not an enormous age gap, and it wasn’t exactly a forced marriage. Frederick was 14 years old, almost 15, which was the age of majority in medieval Sicily, and also beyond the age of majority for marriage according to the church (which was 13). He could participate in decisions affecting him. But the marriage was arranged by Innocent III and Pedro II of Aragon, and Constance was at least 10 and maybe 15 years older than Frederick.

AskHistorians,"The series Vikings depicts ritual sacrifice candidates as going willingly, even eagerly, to their deaths. Is there are historical evidence suggesting that such willingness or eagerness existed in ancient Nordic religion?","There is not, not really.  This trope that you speak of, also seen in other ""Viking media"" such as the Strongbow saga (where the main character's mother volunteers to be a sacrifice) wherein the human sacrifice of the Norse goes willingly to their death is blatantly ahistorical compared to the surviving depictions of human sacrifice rituals that we have knowledge of.  Now to be clear, it actually is rooted in a surviving depiction of human sacrifice, but there is more to this account than might meet the eye.

The evidence for human sacrifice among the Norse is relatively unambiguous.  Interred bodies with broken necks, bog bodies, and a plethora of legal texts, and outside writings all attest to its presence.  This barbaric practice is sometimes whitewashed though by the idea that many, if not most, of the sacrifices were willingly going to their deaths, however this is belied by the actual descriptions that come down to us today, and the circumstances around them.

Ibn Fadlan is one of the best known sources regarding the Norse and their practices, and while his account cannot be trusted entirely given his clear condemnation of much of what he witnesses, as well as the obtuseness of his Arabic (to say nothing of the fact the Rus and the Norse are hardly interchangeable), he does provide a lot of information that has come to be taken as emblematic of the Norse people as whole.  In his account of the death of a noble figure he describes what happens with some of the slaves of the man who has died.  According to Ibn Fadlan, the slave girls are given a choice to follow their master, or not in death, this slave girl then spends the rest of her life being carefully watched by her fellow slaves (implying that she cannot escape_, is constantly drugged with alcohol, and serially gang raped at least twice.  During the moment of her death the men of the community loudly bang on their shields so her screams and cries wouldn't be heard by the other slave girls, so they wouldn't be sacred to follow their future masters into the afterlife.  Despite all of this, according to Ibn Fadlan the sacrifice was still, loosely, willing to go along with he decision until the last moment.

>I saw that the girl did not know what she was doing. She wanted to enter the pavilion, but she put [her head] between it and the boat. Then the old woman seized her head, made her enter the pavilion and went in with her. The men began to bang on their shields with staves, to drown her cries, so that the other slave girls [would not be frightened]and try to avoid dying with their masters. Next, six men entered the pavilion and [lay with] the girl, one after another, after which they laid her beside her master. Two seized her feet and two others her hands. The old woman called the Angel of Death came and put a cord round her neck in such a way that the two ends went in opposite directions. She gave the ends to two of the men, so they could pull on them. Then she herself approached the girl holding in her hand a dagger with a broad blade and [plunged it again and again between the girl’s ribs],84 while the two men strangled her with the cord until she was dead.

So it is rather difficult to call this a truly ""willing"" sacrifice for a number of reasons.  These women are slaves, slaves who do not have rights over their own bodies since they are the property of others.  Furthermore they are continuously drugged with alcohol, the full information about their death is withheld from them, and they are not allowed to back out of the arrangement if they think better of their decision.  

By modern standards this is clearly not a ""willing"" process.  The victims of these brutal deaths are drugged, raped, and kept in the dark about their future, as well as not allowed to back out of their decision.  

Other sacrifices are not as well attested, and seem to have been carried out by hanging or strangulation as well, and it is impossible to determine the specific circumstances around the deaths of most other sacrifices.  While it is perhaps *possible* that some of these victims were willing to go to their deaths, we have other evidence, for example from some surviving legal texts, that shows that sacrifice to the gods was connected with judicial execution (hardly a willing process).  And given compelling evidence to the contrary, I personally am willing to speculate that many of these other interments and sacrifices were likewise unwilling, or were coerced through other processes such as drugging, social pressure, or other forms of pressure.

There are other, later, (usually a couple of centuries after the end of the Viking Age), descriptions of willing self sacrifices in some saga sources, but I don't think that they're useful for actually determining what was and was not practiced in historically pagan times.  I think the archaeological evidence and contemporary accounts of figures like Ibn Fadlan are enough to figure out that these sacrifices were not quite as voluntary as they often are depicted in the modern day."
AskHistorians,"How dangerous was ""being cast into the water"" in Hammurabi's Code? Did Mesopotamians swim?","Executing a person by drowning would be pretty straightforward, regardless of their ability to swim, just hold their head in water until they stop struggling. But that's not really the answer you're after.

First: The law code of Hammurabi is not really a law code in the sense it's often presented as. It's a monument (quite literally an impressive seven foot tall basalt obelisk with a carving of Hammurabi receiving laws from the god Shamash at the top). It was constructed late in Hammurabi's reign and is a testament to his own interest and efforts in creating a lawful, just (by the standards of the time) society. As he puts in his own epilogue: ""...In my shelter I have let them repose in peace; in my deep wisdom have I enclosed them. That the strong might not injure the weak, in order to protect the widows and orphans..."" 

I hate to quote a movie that came out when kids in your class might not have been alive, but they were more...guidelines, really. There are court records from the old Babylonian period (and many court records from the Ur III period as well, with the preceding law code of Ur-Nammu as a potential reference) and they, with very rare exception, don't make any reference to precedent, or structured laws, or anything really. The judges in cases had pretty free reign to decide guilt and penalties as they saw fit. They were often more lenient than you'd expect from the law code itself, with the harshest penalties (including death) being pretty rare, even in situations that might technically have called for it from the law code. So keep that in mind.

So what's all this about rivers and drowning and ordeals, which I think is really what you're referring to, given your reference to trial by combat? 

In ancient Mesopotamia, and in the ancient world in general, and frankly in much of the world until recently, people took this stuff very seriously. They believed in their gods and their ability to influence events in the world, and people's lives. This is something I think fiction and popular history really underplays. Kings, Hammurabi included, consulted the gods on even seemingly trivial matters. Not 'is it a good idea to attack this land?"" but rather ""is it a good idea to deploy this number of troops on Tuesday the 17th led by this particular general and executing the discussed plan?""

So with that in mind, swearing a oath to a god was no small thing. The gods didn't like people lying in their name and a person doing so could expect divine retribution. Many cases were decided by simply seeing who was willing to swear an oath. Often someone, or their witness in a case, would be unwilling to, settling the matter. It's interesting to imagine someone pushing a lie possibly getting cold feet when it came time to lie to a divine authority, or a witness realizing the risk wasn't worth it. So the gods could be counted on to punish people trying to evade justice, but they operated on their own timetable in their own ways. Sometimes you need an answer a bit more reliably and immediately. That's the idea of the river ordeal - the gods could make their opinion known without much room for interpretation and quickly. If people were already uncomfortable just swearing a false oath, asking them to really back it up under threat of immediate death was even harder. In some cases it seems just escalating to the river ordeal sorted things out. An accused agreeing to it was a strong statement and the accuser may have backed down (and you'll notice false accusations are treated harshly, best to not have your falsehood put on display when the accused doesn't drown - the stakes were high here). It seems, like the death penalty and other harsh penalties, it was rarely actually carried out. The seriousness of it and the shared belief in its effectiveness was often enough to settle issues.

But nevertheless it was actually carried out sometimes. The actual method varied and may have been up to a judge just like the actual application of law was. It's easy to imagine that often the accused was given a simple goal - go in the river and don't drown. Guilty or not they'd probably be just fine, as we know now. Sometimes they were given a difficult task, such as carrying a heavy item a certain distance or staying afloat some distance (in which case failure didn't necessarily mean drowning). One well known example is a letter to king Zimri-Lin (a contemporary of Hammurabi ruling Mari). It's a report of the outcome of a river ordeal at the city of Hit (a popular place for actually performing the ordeal). Taken from Marc van de Mieroop's biography of Hammurabi, it appears to be a property dispute between two places or groups of people. Four people (out of a planned seven) go in the river, first a woman who ""came up immediately."" Then an old man who swam a distance of 80 ""measures."" Then a second woman who also came up immediately. Finally, a third woman goes in and drowns. Given the poor outcomes (the man ""only"" swam 80 measures and one person drowned) they ask to stop, saying they would relinquish their claims to the disputed land for all time. There were three people left to go but at this point they recognized that whatever they may have thought the gods clearly weren't going to side with them. The letter closes with saying the survivors would be sent to Mari to be questioned.

This is really interesting! But as you can see while it provides lots of info it raises lots of questions. This wasn't a criminal trial, this seems like it may have been a civil dispute. It's easy to imagine how two groups might come to disagree on property ownership - contracts can be lost or damaged. Such was the importance of real estate contracts that families sometimes kept contracts that were hundreds of years old in their homes. Obviously there would be no living witnesses to the contract for something that old so the only way, in their minds, to settle this was to ask the gods. That part is understandable, but how did it come to being settled this way? There were other methods of divination available that didn't involve risking lives. Maybe there was animosity between the groups. Since the group ended it after a death after several nonfatal ""failures"" they may have not expected anyone to die, even if they were in the wrong. This whole event may have been unusual - it was reported to the king of Mari and the survivors were sent to be questioned. Were the people of the one group going in because they were the main complainants? Would the other group have to go next? What was their actual task? The man who swam 80 measures (which I'm not sure how far that is) hadn't swam far enough, and of course one woman drowned trying to do whatever it was (the women who came up immediately may have been poor swimmers but they survived). Who chose the participants from the group? Maybe it was random given they don't seem to have been the best swimmers. You can see at least today this isn't a small piece of river (look up Hit, Iraq), was the goal to swim across a wide part (if so, how did the one man save himself then after presumably tiring? Was the goal to swim it completely underwater?). 

The exact details of the Old Babylonian (and Ur III prior to it) river ordeals are murky (pun intended). People willing to swear oaths and risk their lives doing so were often taken at their word so it may not have actually come up often. When it did, the precise details may have varied. And, as seen in the letter to Zimri-Lim, the process could be used as a fast, dramatic way to get an immediate answer from the gods on a matter."
AskHistorians,I know that the burning of the Library of Alexandria is actually a greatly overblown event. But what about the burning of an ancient library and museum in Naples in September 1943? Do we know much about what the Nazis destroyed?,"I think you are referring to the destruction of the collection of the State Archives of Naples on 30 September, 1943, the Grande Archivio di Stato Napoli. I hope so, because I'm very glad you asked about it. It is very poorly known about and was an extremely important and tragic event, one for which the Germans never properly answered. The contents of the Archive had been packed up in over 800 crates and had been moved to the Villa Montesano, near San Paolo Belsito, in the Nola region, about 30 kilometers from Napoli. It was over 30,000 manuscript volumes and 50,000 documents. By late September 1943, the Allies were drawing near, and German scavenger/rigger crews of three to five men had been fanning out across the countryside, looting everything they could and rigging everything else with mines and booby traps. Many many many historical buildings were destroyed in the next few weeks. When they came to Montesano on 28 September, they forced their way in to the villa and discovered both the many piles of crates there and also the remnants of the Archive staff, which were there to look after the contents. The Germans asked what it was, cracked open a few of the crates, and were told the contents were of importance to Italian cultural heritage. They went away but soon a different group and an officer appeared, again forcefully entered, and again went away. There was a sense of foreboding, especially after a German soldier was killed in the nearby town. [Count Riccardo Filangieri](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07aaf845-e03f-429c-9db9-f0224aa01381_403x522.jpeg) was nearby and although he says he was not initially alarmed, since up to that point the Germans had not embarked on any deliberate campaign of cultural heritage destruction, still he thought it prudent to write a letter to the local German commander. In the letter he explained that the documents belonged to the Naples Archive, that they were of great cultural importance not only to Italy but to all of Europe, including German history. 

This was too late. A squad of Germans arrived on the 30th in the morning and announced that the entire archive would be destroyed. Attempts to communicate with the German officer were in vain, though the Count says his letter was shown and even translated into French (I guess they could not translate it to German). He reacted angrily and within minutes the entire villa was in flames, along with all the contents. Evelyn Jamison wrote that ""The deliberate, senseless destruction of the documents belonging to the Grande Archivio di Stato of Naples is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, single crime against history committed by the German army during the late war."" In addition to the tens of thousands of precious documents, the villa also contained the contents of the Count's own art collection, including pieces by Van Eyck, Boticelli, Chardin, and Pontormo, as well as his personal collection of ancient ceramics and glasswares.

The Count tells us directly about these events in ""Report on the Destruction by the Germans, September 30, 1943, of the Depository of Priceless Historical Records of the Naples State Archives,"" *American Archivist* Vol. 7, No. 4 (Oct., 1944), pp. 252-255. He writes:

> The extent of the disaster is enormous. In that depository I had collected all the most precious series of documents coming from the various archives of the south of Italy. And their destruction has created an immense void in the historical sources of European civilization, a void which nothing will ever be able to fill.

He lists what was destroyed. All of this material is early medieval or later, as far as I can tell, but it would be great if some Medievalists in the sub could offer further comment about what some of these collections contained specifically. I am supplementing the count's terse list with some info from Evelyn M. Jamison, ""Documents from the Angevin Registers of Naples: Charles I"", *Papers of the British School at Rome* Vol 17 (1949), pp. 87-173.

- Registri of the Anjou Chancery (1265-1435); Jamison calls it 507 volumes total, with the 378 Stately Registri on parchment and bound in leather; 66 Fascicoli of administrative acts on paper from the 13th and 14th centuries; the 38 volumes of ""Arche in pergamena"" and 21 volumes of ""Arche in carta."" Together they were ""a veritable storehouse"" of history on the Kingdom of Sicily, and ""every aspect of its life."" Jamison reports that what was lost in this has (or will be) partially restored via notes and small extracts preserved elsewhere (so some good news!).

AskHistorians,What language would the Crusaders have spoken to each other?,"The First Crusaders typically called themselves ""Franks"" because they mostly came from France and mostly spoke French, or at least they probably spoke several similar Romance languages - dialects of northern French (Norman, Picard, Walloon), southern French (Occitan), and Italian, which were all different languages by then, but still pretty similar, much more similar than they are now anyway. Some might have spoken other Romance variants as well, like Catalan, Castilian, Galician, etc.

France happened to be the main target of crusade preaching, especially for the First Crusade. Pope Urban II was French - his real name was Odo of Lagery and he was from Chatillon-sur-Marne in Champagne. The Council of Clermont was held in France in 1095, and the pope recruited powerful allies in Adhemar, Bishop of Le Puy, and Raymond, Count of Toulouse, both from southern France. 

But crusaders also came from German-speaking parts of the HRE (Bavaria, Bohemia etc.), who probably didn't speak French. There were also English crusaders, who at the time were culturally French, if they were nobles. There were also Scandinavian, Polish, and Hungarian crusaders and they must not have spoken French.

One of the chroniclers of the crusade, Fulcher of Chartres, noted the languages he heard from all over Europe:

>“And whoever heard such a mixture of languages in one army? There were present Franks, Flemings, Frisians, Gauls, Allobroges, Lotharingians, Alemanni, Bavarians, Normans, English, Scots, Aquitanians, Italians, Dacians, Apulians, Iberians, Bretons, Greeks, and Armenians. If any Breton or Teuton wished to question me I could neither reply nor understand.” (Fulcher of Chartres, pg. 88)

So how did they communicate? Some of them may have spoken a Romance language as a secondary language. If they were clerics like Fulcher who had been educated by the church, then as you mentioned, they could have communicated in Latin.

Some crusaders could have also acted as interpreters for others. When the crusaders reached the Byzantine Empire, the found lots of westerners serving as interpreters and translators in Constantinople. The Normans of southern Italy had been in contact with the Empire for decades already - sometimes friendly contact, sometimes unfriendly, as the Normans frequently attacked Byzantine territory. But that also means that some Normans in the crusader army might have spoken Greek.

One Norman crusader, Herluin, acted as an interpreter between the crusaders at the Seljuks during the siege of Antioch in 1098. Herluin could speak “their language”, although the crusader sources don’t seem to know what language it was - presumably Turkish, Persian, or Arabic. Maybe he had been to the Middle East before, or maybe he had picked up one of these languages in Constantinople. But if there were interpreters for foreign languages like Greek or Turkish, then it is reasonable to assume the armies also included people who could speak and interpret more than one Romance dialect.

In the years and decades after the First Crusade, the crusaders established a kingdom in Jerusalem and other states in Antioch, Edessa, and Tripoli. Plenty of languages were spoken there long before the Franks arrived - Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Coptic, Aramaic, and probably others. The crusader states were considered ""French"" by everyone who lived there. The crusaders called themselves ""Franks"" and all their neighbours called them that as well.  

The Franks typically didn't learn any native languages, except on rare occasions. For example, in 1187, when Saladin re-conquered most of the kingdom, Reginald, the lord of Sidon, told his troops to surrender in Arabic, so Saladin would understand him, but then told them in French to keep fighting. Some of the native Christian population probably also learned French. Afterwards the capital of the kingdom was moved to the port city of Acre, which was a multicultural and multilingual economic hub.

>“Had we been given the chance to walk through the bustling markets and streets of thirteenth-century Acre, we would have been struck by the great variety of languages used. Other than French, which was the dominant language spoken in the city, these would have included Provençal, various Italian and German dialects, English, Arabic and Greek…the composite character of the Latin East’s population and its mosaic-like structure resulted in a plurilingual situation in which different linguistic communities shared a given territory with only a small number of people serving as intermediaries.” (Rubin, pg. 62)

It was probably fairly easy to find an interpreter or translator. The crusaders even borrowed an Arabic word for “interpreter”, which they pronounced “dragoman”:

>“This title is a corruption of the Arabic tarjuman - or interpreter…From the first, the Frankish lords would have needed interpreters to transmit their commands to their Arab villagers; and there already existed an established officer, the mutarjim...” (Riley-Smith, pg. 15)

In the 12th century, the Franks usually wrote in Latin, but in the 13th century, almost all of their laws and historical chronicles are in French, specifically a northern French, *langue-d'oïl* variant. It was very heavily influenced by Norman and Picard, and the prestigious French of the royal court in the Île-de-France. By the 13th century, there were also plenty of merchants and notaries and other inhabitants of the crusader states from southern France (Marseilles, Montpellier) and Italy (Genoa, Pisa, Venice). Among themselves they would probably use their own Occitan or Italian dialects, but the standard working language of the Frankish kingdom was definitely a northern *oïl* language.

There's a popular belief that the Mediterranean “lingua franca”, which was a real pidgin language among merchants and sailors in the 16th century, actually developed as early as the crusades. That would make sense since everyone was speaking ""French"", but

>“...this thesis is based on fantasy rather than reality: there is no historical connection between the languages used in the Latin East in the Middle Ages and the Italian-based pidgin documented on the coast of Northern Africa from the sixteenth century on.” (Minervini, pg. 19)

So, in short, most of the original crusaders spoke French, and those who didn't could have communicated with other educated people in Latin, but if they didn't know French or Latin they would have had to find interpreters to help them. Fortunately there were lots of interpreters among the crusaders for numerous languages. In the Frankish crusader states, the ""official"" language of law and government was French, but there was a large population of Italians. The population in general also spoke Greek, Arabic, Aramaic, and other languages, but there were already plenty of interpreters, and they simply added French to their repertoire.

AskHistorians,Was Goliath actually the underdog in the biblical story?,[removed]
AskHistorians,Did charles Darwin recant his theory on his deathbed?,"I'm not a historian, but I've researched this particular point for debates with creationists, and hopefully I'll be able to direct you to proper sources.

Darwin died in April 1882, in his house in Downe. The rumor of him rejecting his beliefs first surfaced in 1887, when a certain Presbyterian minister in Toronto was heard preaching that Darwin ""*when on his death-bed, abjectly whined for a minister and renouncing evolution, sought safety in the blood of the Savior*"". The editor of *Toronto Mail* wrote to Darwin's collaborator Thomas Huxley to inquire if there was any truth to this; Huxley forwarded the question to Charles Darwin's son Francis, and he replied that it was false.

However, a better-known and more persistent version of this story has a name attached to it: Lady Elizabeth Hope. She was an Evangelist who did indeed live within a few miles of Darwin's house in Downe and dedicated her life to preaching to the locals. Later in her life, she moved to the US. On August 15th 1915, addressing an audience in Northfield, Mass., she told the story of her alleged visit to Darwin on his deathbed. She described in detail how an ill and bed-ridden scientist lamented his past ""mistakes"", saying ""*I was a young man with uninformed ideas... people made a religion of them*"", discussed the Bible with her, and asked her to preach to the gathering of his servants and tenants. We have such a detailed account because this story was soon published in the *Boston Watchman-Examiner* and was later reprinted in the *Bombay Guardian*. Most of the later references to this event can be traced to Lady Hope's account, even though by now they lost all of the attached names and details.

Now, it goes without saying that a claim made 33 years after the fact by a source that definitely had their own beliefs on the matter should be scrutinized before it is taken at face value. And scrutinized it was: Lady Hope's account was specifically addressed by both Darwin's son Francis and his daughter Henrietta. Henrietta, who was at her father's deathbed, denied that he ever recanted evolution, and Francis stated that Lady Hope never even met Darwin. The latter *might* be contested (at the very least, she knew enough about his household to mention a gazebo that was indeed present at the premises), but the scrutiny doesn't stop there: she got some details wrong (from the description of an ""Autumn morning"", whereas he died in April, to him allegedly being bedridden for months, which wasn't the case).

Lastly, we have Darwin's own words about his beliefs. Ironically, the same family members mentioned above muddied the waters a bit, because they edited some of his texts before publishing them to make him seem like *less* of an Atheist, presumably to appease his widow Emma who was a Unitarian. However, what we know is quite conclusive:

""Another source of conviction of the existence of God... follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe... as the result of blind chance of necessity... This conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can remember, when I wrote the *Origin of Species*, and it is since that time that it has very gradually, with many fluctuations, become **weaker** *\[emphasis mine\]*... I for one must be content to remain an Agnostic.""

\-- Charles Darwin, *Autobiography* (written starting in 1876, published in 1887).

So the evolution (pun not intended) of Darwin's beliefs was the opposite of what Lady Hope claimed; and while we can argue whether he ended up being an Agnostic or an Atheist, I don't think this distinction matters for the debate at hand. One thing's for sure: he wasn't a ""young man with uninformed ideas"" at 50 years old, when he wrote his seminal work.

The main source for this write-up has been *Darwinian Myths: The Legends and Misuses of a Theory* (1997) by Edward Caudill, which elaborates on the same points way better than is feasible in a comment, and backs up all its claims with citations. The section discussing this particular myth is available [in the Google Books preview](https://books.google.ge/books?id=w8Dck84J67MC&lpg=PA49&vq=%22the%20lady%20hope%20story%22&hl=ru&pg=PA53#v=snippet&q=%22the%20lady%20hope%20story%22&f=false), or if you search ""the lady hope story"" within the text."
AskHistorians,When Hamilton dueled Burr was it common for men to shoot the ground in front of their opponent and did Hamilton assume these rules?,"This is based on a common misconception about the Burr-Hamilton duel that Hamilton deloped, or intended to delope (the action of intentionally missing at the exchange, as opposed to a reservation of fire). No one involved in the duel claims this to have happened! The disagreement by the sides was whether he meant to hit Burr and missed, or was hit and then fired involuntarily but had meant to reserve his fire. I've written on this before though for a similar question, which I'll repost below:

[When Aaron Burr learned that Alexander Hamilton may have intended not to fire his shot or aimed to miss Burr during their fatal 1804 duel, he described it as ""Contemptible, if true."" Why would choosing not to fire or to deliberately miss be considered shameful in a pistol duel?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a4uycc/when_aaron_burr_learned_that_alexander_hamilton/ebhz0f6/)

So the Burr-Hamilton duel takes place at a rather interesting junction for 'deloping', which is the act of purposefully missing your opponent in a duel (technically the act of reserving your fire - simply *not* shooting, is not the same, but closely related of course). I've written at length on the issue of 'who shot first' in the Burr-Hamilton duel, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8xzy2f/hamilton_v_burr_who_shot_first/), so I won't focus much on the specific of their encounter beyond saying that there were *very important political stakes* in establishing what Hamilton intended to do, and Burr's specific admonition refers to the belief that Hamilton and his allies were attempting to humiliate him. Much of Burr's sentiment stems not from the broader appeal to the code but rather from the specific circumstances present in their interview.

Now, as for deloping, generally, traditionally, it was an act that *you were not supposed to do*. The 1777 'Irish Code Duello', which is one of the first, and certainly most influential of the early dueling codes established very clear guidelines, with Rule 12 stating:

>No dumb firing or firing in the air is admissible in any case. The challenger ought not to have challenged without receiving offence, and the challenged ought, if he gave offence, to have made an apology before he came on the ground; therefore children's play must be dishonourable on one side or the other, and is accordingly prohibited. 

Or put more plainly, if you aren't on the dueling ground in complete earnest, why are you there? It is supposed to drive home the central point of the duel, which is that in participating you are putting your very life on the line over a matter of honor, and if either one or both are not doing so than it undercuts the institution itself. More practically of course, it was a very *risky* move, since to delope placed yourself at great risk. You couldn't tell your opponent in advance of course, as it would be seen as an act of supreme cowardice, so you were essentially gambling on them *missing* on the first fire and recognizing that you had deloped and then not demanding a second, or else that they would be slow enough to notice that you had fired intentionally wide. 

Now as I said though, 1804 is an interesting juncture, as while continually derided by 'purists' as an act that went against the very heart of what the duel stood for, deloping was becoming more practiced and more accepted in the early 19th century Anglo-American tradition, a reflection of a shifting idea of what the duel itself stood for. Traditionally, the duel revolved around the person who had been insulted, and the focus was on them. They were going through the duel to demonstrate that they *did* have honor, and wipe clean the belmish that whatever the insult has been wrought on them. But more and more - although not completely - the focus shifted on the one who had made the insult, and going through the duel was their offer of apology in a sense, their message to the other that they meant no disrespect towards the insulted man's honor. 

It may seem a fine distinction, but it mattered greatly. In the first view, it *being shot at* was important for the insulted person, while in the second, *getting to shoot* mattered more. Up until about 1800, when we start to see the transition - although it wouldn't be in full bloom until after the end of the Napoleonic Wars - a man who deloped or held his fire would not only be removing the possibility of satisfaction for his opponent, but also calling upon himself the imputation of cowardice, as it was seen by many as an attempt to induce an end to the affair after the first fire - a risky venture, but perhaps safer than going for two or three exchanges. But again, it shifted over time, and not only would be acceptable in, say, 1830, but even expected by many. While in the late 18th century, one duelist refusing to fire would oft as not result in the other becoming quite angry and demanding a second fire, a few decades later the Seconds *blamed* for failing to end an affair where one duelist had chosen to do so.



Three duels stand as great examples of this. A 1789 duel involving an officer of the Coldstream Guards saw the man fail to fire, enraging an observer enough to write a public letter to the Regiment, published in *The Times*, where he took the man to task for depriving his opponent of the right to prove his courage under fire and restore his damaged honor:

>In such a case as this, is not a breach of Promise a breach of Honour? And does not a man’s public assent to terms which he is Privately determined not to abide by, become an act of DUPLICITY incompatible with the character of an Officer and a Gentleman … Can he, according to the laws of honour, come into the field under a solemn engagement to fire his pistol on a certain signal, and yet when that signal was given, reserve his fire, and refuse openly to fulfil what he had PUBLICALLY engaged to perform?

Unfortunately more specifics on this one are unknown - a side effect of how many sources deal with the duel - but it nevertheless is a stellar example of the sentiment in the late 18th century.

In the middle we have Jonathan Christie and John Scott, who dueled at Chalk Farm in 1821, and present an interesting example of the muddled evolution here, and also the failure of the seconds to properly protect their principles. Christie, the challenged party had confided to his second that he would not fire, fairly consistent with developing more of the time where, as the one who had given insult, he was manfully giving his opponent the chance to take his potshot, and that he would delope on the first fire. He followed through with this plan, and Scott aimed, but merely missed. Christie made a great mistake, however, in not being as obvious as he ought to have, firing wide but still level, instead of straight in the air which would have been the more obvious visible signal. Scott had no knowledge of the delope, and only James Traill, the second, had noticed. Rather than point this out to the opposing second and end the affair, he and Patmore, Scott's second barely talked at all, simply reloading for a second exchange - rather contrary to general expectation which ought to have sought a reconciliation.

Scott only first caught wind when Traill handed the pistol to Christie and *admonished him for his behavior*. In his own recollection, Traill claimed to have told him:

>Gentlemen, before this proceeds, I must insist on one thing. You, Mr. Christie, must give yourself the usual chances , and not again fire in the air, or fire away from Mr. Scott.

Scott himself recalled only the latter part, as:

>Now, Mr. Christie, take your aim, and do not throw away your ad­vantage as you did last time.

The distinction was a small one in any case, and Scott exclaimed on the ground *""What! did not Mr. Christie fire at me?""* but Patmore, misunderstanding the entire exchange, ordered Scott to be silent as it was improper for any communication by the principles not through their seconds. It is clear enough that Scott would likely have been amenable to ending the affair after one fire, but circumstances conspired against him. Patmore acted properly as he understood, but was bereft of at least some of the facts, and Traill was at the very least quite negligent, although it can be speculated that he subscribed to the more archaic view of the duel as the proper exchange of fire. in any case though, on the second fire, Scott fell, shot in the hip. Patmore, finally learning of what had in fact transpired began arguing with Traill that *Why was it not communicated to me-l knew nothing of it?""* while Christie felt quite saddened by what he had done, noting:

>Why was I permitted to fire a second time? I discharged my pistol down the field before: I could do no more. I was compelled to fire in my own defence.

And additionally doing all he could to assist Scott on the grounds, being taken to the nearby tavern to hopefully recover. He survived a week, but finally took a turn for the worse and died of his wound, all the while a small battle in the papers was ongoing over which of the seconds had been more to blame for allowing things to go the way they did. For Christie at least, the reporting helped him however. Although quite unlikely to have been convicted anyways in this period, when juries routinely nullified any charges against an honorable duelist, at his trial, even the prosecutor was fairly on his side, and he was acquitted without difficulty. And of course, whatever castigation heaped upon the Seconds for their failure, they too were in the end acquitted.

AskHistorians,Why did the Roman legions prefer swords as a primary fighting weapon?,"It is fair to say that Roman infantry combat was more sword centric than Classical hoplite warfare or Hellenistic Macedonian pike phalanx tactics. The case for the sword as a national weapon has been argued by Simon James *Rome and the Sword* (2011). But one thing that is important to note is that Romans did not just fight with *gladii*. Rather, the sword worked as part of a ""weapon system"" that consisted of the soldier's *pila*, *scutum*, and heavy body armor.  Skallagrim's video makes good points, but note his swordsman confronts a pole arm bearer when armed only with a sword, and is also alone. Roman legionaries were effective with their swords because they were carrying a large body shield, wearing a thick cast bronze helmet and by c. 200 BC, mail shirts; and when they attacked enemies with their swords, they may have just softened them up with heavy shield-piercing javelins. In those conditions, a good sword like the *gladius hispaniensis* works pretty well.

The first key complimentary weapon was the *pilum*. This was a heavy javelin, whose long shank allowed it to punch through a shield but continue to penetrate forward to reach the man behind it. Javelins were very common in ancient warfare, but usually as a tool of light infantry (and by light infantry I mean infantry that was not expected to hold ground, but fell back to avoid close contact with the enemy.) Most javelins were however too light to pierce a well made shield, and were therefore primarily skirmishing weapons.  But the *pilum* allowed Roman *hastati* and *principes* to engage enemy heavy infantry with javelins, obviously a real advantage. Who cares if an opposing phalangite has a 20 foot *sarisa*, when you can chuck a *pilum* at him from 75 feet, and pierce through his shield. So trading a spear for a heavy javelin offered some real tactical advantages.

There is one downside of arming heavy infantry with javelins: they don't have very many! Roman legionaries carried two. Not a lot of ammo. So if they are expected to hold ground, they need to be able to fight with their swords for extended periods. The *gladius*, rather than being a backup weapon of last resort, was therefore a primary weapon.

Next the *gladius* worked well with the *scutum*. As the query notes, swords are short. Roman *gladii* during the Republic on the whole seem to have been about 10-15 cm (4-6 inches) longer than Greek xiphe or machairai (although they shortened under the empire), but even so a 65 cm blade still doesn't have all that much reach. So you need a good shield if you have any hopes of getting close enough to a spearman/pike man to get inside his shaft and do damage with your blade. And the *scutum* is a very good large body shield (c. 4 feet by 2.5 feet). Furthermore, because it is a boss-gripped, its possible to punch forward with it. If you use the lower rim, you punch about 4 feet in front of you, giving you extra reach beyond the two foot blade. Knock your enemy off kilter, and then close to finish him with the sword. The tactic of punching with the lower rim can be seen on the Pydna monument of Aemilius Paullus, on an early imperial metope from the Mainz Principia, and is attested literarily by Tacitus (*Agr*. 36).  

Finally, Roman legionaries were very heavily armored, and this gave them an additional advantage is close in sword fighting, where again you need to survive getting inside your opponents' spear and its best if every blow they do land is not lethal. By the late 3rd century BC, Roman soldiers were the first Mediterranean people to widely adopt mail armor, and this likely offered a special advantage when fighting more lightly armored opponents (B. Devereaux, ""The Adoption and Impact of Mail Armor in the Third and Second Centuries BCE"" *Chiron*, Forthcoming). Even before that, the Montefortino helmet was made of very thick cast bronze, putting a lot of metal between an enemy's spear and the Roman's skull. So when you are very heavily armored, you have both the physical protection and psychological confidence to close with a two foot long *gladius*. And your more lightly armored opponent, who has a shorter sword and smaller shield, is going to be all the more spooked the closer you get.

The closest thing the Romans encountered to a bladed pole arm (i.e. excluding spears/pikes) was the Dacian falx, a long sickle attached to a pole and wielded with two hands, sort of like a late medieval bill. The solution in the Dacian Wars was simply to increase the armor of the legionary, with reinforced helmets and the addition of gladiatorial style *manciae* (sleeve protectors), still making them superior in close combat to Dacian warriors.

Finally, Roman soldiers did not fight alone. The length of the Roman *gladius*, still relatively short, was largely determined by the need to maintain relatively compact infantry formations, although the Romans famously fought in a looser order than the Macedonians. But still, the legionary was a soldier in formation, which means if he got into trouble, there were soldiers next to him and behind him who can bring their *gladii*/*pila*/*scuta* to bear."
AskHistorians,"We often hear that the in the battle of attrition in WW2 , the Luftwaffe was unable to replace the highly trained pilots at the rate that it lost them. How is it that the RAF, a small island nation was able to replace their pilots at a better rate than the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain?","There are a number of elements to consider. Britain, and by extension the RAF, wasn't exactly standing alone in 1940, a point made at the time in [a famous Punch cartoon](https://magazine.punch.co.uk/image/I00004lS91fhaQno) (""So our poor old Empire is alone in the world."" ""Aye, we are - the whole five hundred million of us.""). Not just the Empire either - after the fall of France personnel from defeated European air forces (primarily Polish and Czech) made their way to the UK; 574 pilots of the Battle (around a fifth) [weren't British](https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/history-of-the-battle-of-britain/battle-of-the-nations/). The Commonwealth Air Training Plan turned out a huge number of aircrew (though not in time for the Battle of Britain).

Fighter Command also had the great advantage that RAF aircrew who bailed out over land or crash landed could return to action if not seriously injured, whereas German Air Force personnel were [inevitably captured](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j7mn26/what_happened_to_axis_pilots_downed_over_britain/) if they survived. Fighter Command lost over 1000 aircraft but only around 540 pilots over the course of the Battle (Bomber Command actually lost more aircrew over the same period, bombers having larger crews and the reverse problem of operating over enemy territory and likelihood of capture). The German Air Force lost almost 2000 aircraft and over 2500 aircrew killed or captured.

Both British and German intelligence was faulty; both sides overestimated the losses they were inflicting on the other, but where the British overestimated the size of the German Air Force and therefore geared for a prolonged battle of attrition, Germany underestimated the size of the RAF, so by September Goering, head of the German Air Force, was informed that there were only 100 serviceable British fighters left whereas actually there were over 700 with twice the number of pilots. Dowding, the commanding office of Fighter Command, was nevertheless concerned that his force was ""going down hill"" - losses at times outstripped replacements and with training time reduced to get pilots to the squadrons the quality of personnel inevitably suffered as experienced pilots were shot down. He didn't have the full picture from the German side, though, who were suffering from similar if not greater pressures, so although the switch of German tactics from primarily attacking airfields to bombing London did give Fighter Command some respite it did not fundamentally affect the outcome of the Battle."
AskHistorians,"When Washington, DC was established, several thousand people were already living in the area that Congress designated for the federal district. How did they react to this development, and especially the fact that it would deprive them of representation in the government?","Prior to the actual implementation of Congressional authority in 1801 with the Organic Act, the existing populace didn't really reflect on the reality of what the change would mean, but it is hard to blame them as there was no guarantee that it would take the path that it did! Up until 1800, if you lived on the Maryland side of the District, you could still vote in Maryland... Likewise for the Virginia side. The issue had been briefly raised during ratification of the Constitution, but essentially ignored as a can to kick down the road to later. It only became clear what would change in the brief period after the election of 1800. The Federalists, losing power to the Democrats, rammed through the Organic Act of 1801 - the bill which established the parameters under which DC would exist - during the lame duck period, and with very little debate, as Congress was quite exhausted over the Presidential election that had taken up their attention prior. Desiring to strengthen the Federal government to the greatest degree possible, it took away a great deal of autonomy for the District - and basically all of it for the City of Washington (Georgetown and Alexandria retaining their local governments, but Washington City having none).

Residents definitely were *not* happy, but it is perhaps an interesting quirk that the cry was taken up the most by a recent transplant, Augustus Brevoort Woodward, who only arrived in the area in 1797. He began publishing a series of pieces in the *National Intelligencer* under the pen name of Epaminondas lambasting the deprivation of the rights of the inhabitants there as placing the United States ""at the rear of the nations of the civilized world"". But he was hardly alone, with a petition signed by some 200 residents of Washington City presented to Congress laying out their concerns (a not insignificant number of the electorate, which was then only propertied white males, and numbered roughly 260), and a similar petition from the residents of Alexandria pleading to retain their representation in Congress.

What should be noted though is that generally speaking the residents *were* in favor of Federal control. There was great concern that an act might pass which left jurisdiction to Maryland and Virginia, and if so, the Capital would not remain in DC. They *wanted* to be the Capital. There was a lot of promise that came with the designation, and there was hope for the existing communities that it would be a major economic boon. What they didn't want was to lose representation. The biggest outcry over this was in Washington City, which stood to lose *everything*, since unlike Georgetown and Alexandria they would not even have a city council, but the loss of Congressional representation was certainly not popular for anyone and cause of alarm.

Lawmakers didn't particularly care about this though. In an echo of rhetoric that still seems present as I recall a congressman saying basically the same thing only a week or two back, the argument was essentially that being so close to Congress, if DC residents had an issue they needed to raise, they would be able to do so easily and get the redress they needed. Additional arguments were that with such a small population, representation was meaningless anyways for the city and perhaps ""The Constitution might be so altered as to give them a delegate of the General Legislature when their numbers should become sufficient"" for it to matter... which of course was a promise never again remembered! It would be less than three months between the point the nature of the bill came to be known, and its passage, so while there was great outcry from the residents, it did nothing to stop the passage and they had had little time to oppose it in any case.

There was at least *some* concession, but really only to Washington City, which a year later would be given a city council... but it wouldn't be until 1812 the council could appoint the mayor, and 1820 until the mayor was chosen by popular vote. And of course Congress retained veto power over their city council. A council of course was already granted to the existing polities of Georgetown and Alexandria, so for them, there was essentially no concession. They had lost their Congressional representation, and that was simply that.

So essentially, from the get-go DC was a political toy of Congress who ignored the will of its residents, while at the same time claiming that the *power* of mere residency counterbalanced the deficiencies. Residents only definitively learned that they were to be deprived of their Federal representation in December of 1800, enough time for a great hue and cry, but the outgoing Federalists didn't care in the slightest, more interested in passing a bill which ensured as much Federal power over the District as they were able to manage. Although the common law of the respective states remained in force on the respective sides of the river, it was without voting rights there, and without *jurisdiction*. 

And almost *immediately* new cries started up, with Washington City asking for unified control of the entire District - hope being that a full Territorial government would maybe put them on the path to voting rights, but Alexandria and Georgetown *not* wanting that - as it would be Washington City stealing their wealth - and some trying to push for retrocession as they way to regain their lost franchise, a move which saw some support in Congress from the Democratic-Republicans who didn't like the Organic Act of 1801 in the first place. Debate in Congress went on until 1808, including proposals to just abandon the city as the capital in favor of a return to Philadelphia (the great fear of Washington City dwellers if the District was split asunder)... but it went nowhere. For those in Alexandria and Georgetown, it wasn't clear how many wanted *retrocession* versus merely gaining their rights. They had after all been mostly in favor of inclusion in the District originally (but of course ignorant of the cost), and even many Democatic-Republicans were thus unwilling to act against what they saw as the consent of those residents. And as for Washington City residents, fearing they would lose their status as capital, they simply stopped advocating, as they *certainly* felt that it wasn't a tradeoff they were willing to stomach, and those in Georgetown and Alexandria simply lacked the political capital at that point. 

Alexandria City and County (later Arlington County) would of course revive that call though in the 1830s. The promised economic benefits of being the Capital never materialized south of the Potomac. Being part of the District caused stagnation, and also fears of possible anti-slavery legislation in the near future, so what benefits they were allegedly gaining for the loss of the vote was illusionary. The campaign was revived , and as expanded on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o2ws4i/when_washington_dc_was_first_established_both/h2aetty/), it succeeded this time around.

AskHistorians,Tiny Tina's Floating Feature: A History Of The Borderlands,"I don't know if anyone will find this interesting, but I thought I'd share a few stories of ""borderlands"" in Texas. In modern times, the state of Texas is somewhat notorious as a borderland between the United States and Mexico. But the region we now call Texas has been a borderland for centuries, if not millennia, longer than either nation has existed. This is somewhat unsurprising when you consider the state's geography - Texas crosses from humid, wooded forests in the east to arid and mountainous desert at its western tip, acting as a transition from eastern North America to western North America. 

It was, to a large extent, these climactic differences that have shaped the different cultures that have met and interacted in the Texas borderlands. In the eastern half of the state, with its abundant rain and extensive river systems, the ancestral Caddo people adopted maize agriculture as early as 800 AD, the westernmost outpost of the moundbuilding Mississippian civilizations that held sway over much of eastern North America until around 1700. The more semi-arid bulk of the state, in contrast, remained hunter-gatherers. The Huastec, northernmost outpost of the well-known Mesoamerican civilizations, lived not far to the south of the modern Texas-Mexico border. And to Texas' west, the agricultural civilizations of the American Southwest settled across modern New Mexico. Texas therefore served as a sort of cultural borderland - while direct contact between, say, Mississippian civilization and Mesoamerica is very difficult to prove, artifacts from both have been found across Texas, and if direct contact is ever proven Texas is by far the most likely route. Contact between Southwestern and Mississippian societies via Texas is very well-known - when Spanish explorers first encountered the Caddo, they wore cotton clothing and wore turqoise jewelry, both of which could only have been obtained from New Mexico. 

Texas would become a true imperial borderland at the end of the 17th century. In 1685, a group of Frenchmen hoping to settle at the mouth of the Mississippi River accidentally sailed too far west and landed at Matagorda Bay. They set up a settlement and tried to figure out where they were. Eventually disease and conflict with local peoples would lead to the settlement's demise, but not before the Spanish in New Mexico caught wind of its existence. The Spanish had already been intrigued about the region due to rumors of the powerful ""Kingdom of the Tejas"" (a name they used for the Caddo), and had sent a few expeditions to visit indigenous trading fairs in west Texas. They found the ruined French settlement, then - with the consent of the Caddo - established a few missions in Caddo territory, hoping to make it clear to France that Texas was Spanish territory. 

France, for its part, moved closer to its original destination along the Mississippi River, setting up the colony of Louisiana. Eastern Texas became an imperial borderland, dividing Spanish territory in the west from French territory in the east. But in many ways, this was actually a three-way border - though they allowed Europeans to settle in their territory, the Caddo maintained control of their own land. In 1693, angry that the Spanish refused to punish soldiers who had assaulted Caddo women, the Caddo chased the Spanish out of their territory up to the Colorado River, and did not allow them to return for nearly two decades. When Spain did return and set up Texas' first ""capital"" at Los Adaes (today, ironically enough, in Louisiana), the tiny settlement was dependent on the goodwill of its Caddo neighbors to survive. The result was that, for nearly half a century, the eastern Texas borderlands were less of a hard line between empires and more of a place of cultural mixing, with the Caddo, Spanish, and French all interdependent on each other. Spain attempted to ban smuggling goods to or from French territory, but it had little effect. 

This interdependence would come to a close in 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain. Now that there was no more need to defend their imperial border, Spain pulled its missions and settlements out of eastern Texas (the Caddo had shown little interest in Christianity). The Caddo continued to maintain their sovereignty, but they faced a declining population due to recurring bouts of disease. While the Caddo and Spanish had forged a cooperative relationship due to Caddo strength and Spanish weakness, the next flood of European settlers - Anglo-Americans - were much greater in number and much more hostile to the prospect of living together with indigenous peoples. In 1859, the Caddo would be forced out of Texas into Oklahoma, where they still reside today.

Another Texas borderland story concerns a more famous indigenous group, the Comanche. Despite their fame, the Comanche were relative latecomers to Texas - they began to arrive in earnest in west Texas in the 1700s, challenging the (at the time) dominant Apache. The Comanche were not the only ones fighting the Apache. So too were the Spanish. But by the 1750s, Spain had grown tired of the fighting, and attempted to extend an olive branch. The Apache agreed to allow the Spanish to establish a mission where they would settle and learn about Christianity.

In 1757, Spain established Mission San Saba in modern west-central Texas. Strangely, no Apache seemed interested in settling there. A few came by and told the Spanish they would return later - but this was quite likely a lie. Spain, in their haste to set up a mission for the Apache, had built it within Comanche territory. It's not clear whether this was an accident, or if the Apache engineered it to ensure a fight between their rivals, but in 1758 a coalition of Comanche and their allies sacked and destroyed San Saba, forcing Spain to abandon their attempts at converting the Apache. (Mission San Saba is also known for its rumored silver mines - but geologically, the existence of such mines seems unlikely, and no one has ever found them).

AskHistorians,"I have heard that Roman statues were originally brightly-painted and lost their pigment with time. But when exactly did that happen? Would a visitor to Rome in, say, 1200 have seen colorful statues or white ones?","Medieval Rome and the sculpture of classical Antiquity are somewhat outside my specialization, but given the interest in this question, I feel as though I ought to use my experience teaching about the debates over polychromy in the 19th century (involving Quatremère de Quincy, Hittorff, Semper, and others) as the basis for an answer. 

Today, we use the term polychromy to refer to the use of color to enhance the appearance and realism of sculpture. In Ancient Greece and Rome, polychromy was applied to sculptures in a variety of materials—stone, ivory, metal, terracotta, wood, and plaster—to achieve a more lifelike and naturalistic appearance and a more realistic representation of the subject. Physical attributes like hair were frequently painted to give statues a more distinctive and individualized appearance. Facial features, such as eyes, eyebrows, and lips, were also painted to provide greater depth and expression. In some cases, these details were created separately from metal or pieces of colored stone and inlaid in the sculpture. Roman artists also painted clothing and accessories, such as robes, tunics, belts, and jewelry, to distinguish the social status, occupation, or specific attributes of the depicted figure.

From ancient sources, we know the addition of color to statues was most often done using one of two painting techniques: tempera and encaustic. Tempera uses a protein, often egg, to bind pigments. Encaustic painting employs beeswax. Metallic paints were often used for the armor and weapons on statues of military leaders and warriors. Applying a thin layer of gold leaf was also a common technique for sculptures in marble or bronze, especially those depicting religious figures. These techniques, while complex and sophisticated, required regular maintenance. Tempera paint is not waterproof, encaustic is susceptible to variations in temperature, and gold leaf is prone to flaking.

This means the repainting of statues was a constant effort, one that became ritualized as a form of devotion. Once Rome started shifting away from the existing Hellenic belief system and toward Christianity in the 4th century CE, the maintenance of polychromy on statues declined. Many statues were mutilated and buried, while others were removed from interior sacred spaces and transposed to exterior sites within the city. Differences in the treatment of individual sculptures mean that it’s impossible to give a precise date, but by 1200, any sculptures left exposed to the elements over the preceding centuries would have lost nearly all of their pigment. 

This is confirmed to us in the writings of Magister Gregorius, who visited Rome some time around the beginning of the 13th century. In his *Narracio de Mirabilibus Urbis Romae*, Master Gregory provides a series of personal observations, relating his experiences visiting the Pantheon and a rather smelly bathhouse, among other sites. Notable for its focus on the secular monuments of Rome, Master Gregory’s *Marvels* demonstrates a familiarity with ancient sources and the historical practice of polychromy. He identifies several sculptures known to us today, including the *Spinario* and the Horse Tamers of the Quirinal. Discussing the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius (now the centerpiece of the Piazza del Campidoglio but then at the Lateran Palace), Master Gregory recognizes traces of gilding and condemns those who, in their greed, scraped the gold from the statue. Master Gregory also describes a particular statue of Venus (possibly the Capitoline Venus, one of many variations on the *Venus pudica*). This statue intrigued him to such a degree that he visited it three times, each time overcome by the exquisite paleness of the marble. Seduced by the Venus’ “snowy lips”, Gregory suggests he can detect a slight blush in the statue’s cheeks. Was this hint of red a satirical reference to Ovid’s *Pygmalion*, as some scholars suggest, or did Magister Gregorius spot a lingering trace of thousand-year-old paint?

AskHistorians,Why do we call it 'forced labor' rather than 'slave labor?',"As someone who has published a book with ""forced labor"" in the title, I have to admit that I never gave it much thought. The default term in the field is generally forced labor and the accurate translation of the terminology in the documents I was working with (*munca obligatorie* in Romanian and *Zwangsarbeit* in German) is ""forced labor"" so I went with it. 

I think the reason is that, at least for Americans, the word ""slave"" connotes chattel slavery as practiced in the United States rather than other than other forms of unfree labor. Although Jewish prisoners and others who were subjected to unfree labor by the Nazis (like Soviet prisoners of war and Soviet and Polish civilian laborers aka *Ostarbeiter*) worked without compensation and were often worked to the point of death, they weren't ""slaves"" in the same sense as enslaved Africans were in the United States, so people writing about the subject have opted for different terminology since that could be problematic or at least politically loaded. And obviously doing the reverse (i.e. referring to enslaved Africans in the US as ""workers,"" ""laborers,"" etc.) is highly problematic and has been at the center of some controversies that are well beyond my area of expertise, so the issue of terminology kind of cuts both ways. Generally academics want to sidestep that kind of controversy since those kinds of debates detract from the actual purpose of their work.

That said, some English language works on Jewish forced labor in Nazi Germany and other countries during the Holocaust (including some written by Americans) have used the term ""slave labor"", and some German works have used the equivalent term *Sklavenarbeit*, so it's not like there's a taboo around it and it's not considered ahistorical.

I don't really know how to cite a source on this since it's basically just my opinion/personal experience as a specialist in the subject and I'm not sure anyone has actually written about this topic specifically (although if they had I'd be very interested to read it). I'm not going to cite my own book for obvious reasons (and because it's not actually pertinent beyond the title) but if you can't find it based on context clues I can't help you."
AskHistorians,Why did Greek gods so often use disguises and deception in order to rape? Was it related to Greek values?,"Righto, as the lack of quality answers here is a bit irking I'll give it a go.

Fair warning, if rape is a sensitive topic for you click away, Greek views on it were pretty reprehensible by modern standards.

There's an assumption in your question we need to address first: that rape is considered immoral in ancient Greece. That's a fair assumption to make and it's broadly true, but rape would not have been looked at in the same manner as it is today.

Today, I think it's fair to say the underlying reason we consider rape to be immoral is because it is an act of violence, and it strips away someone's autonomy (their right to choose). The violence would have still been seen as an issue, but remember that in ancient Greece, women had little to no autonomy to remove (broadly speaking, ancient Greece is a big place, both in terms of time periods and locations). Women were essentially under the control and authority of either their fathers, husbands, or in the case of older women with grown male children, their sons. There's an example of this in the Odyssey, when Telemachus is shown to be behaving correctly when he asserts his place as head of the household over Penelope.

Given the lack of consideration of the autonomy issue by the Greeks then, rape would have been seen in the moral light of something more like burglary, taking something valuable from the owner with force, or assault, the use of physical violence. So (unfortunately) rape wasn't viewed as deeply reprehensible as it is today. Indeed they didn't even have a direct word for rape that's separated from violence or corruption. The actual word ""rape"" comes from latin (rapina) where it means ""robbery"". In Athens, the only laws against rape were for the protection of children, a rape against an adult woman would have been considered hybris, or assault.

Indeed many forms of what we would call rape today were excused by the Greeks as they viewed it as a man's right to have intercourse either with a wife or slave for example. 

It's even blurrier in myth because the women are often described as being ""seduced"" making the intercourse a moral failing on the part of the woman (to the Greeks), not the god. An example of this is Zeus' seduction of Leda, or Europa.

The other issue muddying this is that in those myths much of what we'd describe as rape would have been seen as legitimate intercourse (such as Apollo and Cyrene, as Apollo married her) or a punishment for a transgression by a male family member (Zeus and Rhea).

Finally, some were abandoned by male family members (Zeus and Io), meaning that to the Greeks (and somewhat grossly) no harm was done by the intercourse, as the male family member who would have been harmed had abandoned the woman. In the case of Io, it's actually Io herself that's punished, but by Hera out of jealousy, rather than as a result of any moral failing.

So then, with an understanding of the views of rape in Greece, we can address your main question, was it considered better to rape someone by deceit rather than force?

In the Greek view of rape, what you're really asking there is, is it better to take something you want by deceit or force? The honest answer there is, it depends on the Greek. Greek heroes like Odysseus were revered for their ability to decieve their enemies just as much as heros like Achilles were revered for overcoming them by force.

Hopefully that's at least the start of a decent answer. I'm up for being corrected on any of this if others feel I've misinterpreted anything.

Editing in more info/critiques from the comments for visibility:

On ""rapio"": ""*rapio* in latin has a broad range of meanings in ""take away with violence"" area. So kidnap, rob, ransack, they are all correct.

*stuprum* means shame, but also illicit sexual intercourse (adultery,  rape, incest). The idea of sexual assault in classical culture was more vague than ours.""

I do like this answer overall, and it does a good job of summing up the prevalence of rape in the ancient world, but I'd like to offer some clarifications:

1) I don't think any moral failing is attributed to the women, or nymphs, or whoever else has sex with the gods in disguise; there is never any hint of judgment towards either Alcmene or Leda, for example, and Amphitryon (Alcmene's wife) is very happy to boast that he shared a wife with Zeus (Euripides, Heracles lines 1-2: 'What mortal does not know of the man who shared a bed with Zeus, Argive Amphitryon?). This is rape by modern standards, of course: informed consent cannot be given to someone in disguise, and the Greeks seem to have taken a somewhat similar view, in that the woman was not viewed as guilty. Hera punishes them, of course, but that is because she is fundamentally unable to punish Zeus, and her desire for revenge is generally cast in a negative light (e.g. the Aeneid, partially out of revenge for Zeus' rape of Ganymede, or Euripides' Heracles). Other examples where the woman is (almost) killed as a result, such as Danae and Perseus, are often because the offspring is prophesied to kill whoever, and the attempted murder of babies is not confined to ones born from extra-marital sex (e.g. Oedipus, Paris). And I don't think Zeus is generally presented favourably when doing this either: Moschus' Europa, for example, emphasises the girl's innocence and youth in a way that makes Zeus' approach very uneasy. And Jupiter in Ovid's Metamorphoses is a deeply unpleasant character.

2) Rape by force was considerably worse than rape by deceit; the Greeks might look down on the latter (they would certainly punish, for example, any man who raped another woman in this way), but I think largely (at least in their myths) found it unremarkable. This can I think best be understood (besides violence generally being looked down upon, unless done to an enemy) by considering the treatment of the children of these rapes. At issue here is the idea that the way in which you were conceived affected your personality/nature: the starkest example of this is in Heliodorus' Aethiopica, in which the Ethiopian princess Chariclea is born white because her mother was looking at a painting of Andromeda (stereotypically white) when she had sex. And so from this perspective it is notable that the children of Poseidon, who most often rapes women/nymphs, are generally either monsters or awful humans; we might also think about the alternative myth in which Helen was not the child of the non-violent rape of Leda by Zeus-as-swan, but of the goddess Nemesis violently raped by Zeus. Such rapes might also, when leading to marriage, prove infertile (e.g. Hades and Kore); even when the child is not necessarily problematic (e.g. Ion in Euripides' play), the god's actions are presented in a very unsettling way. This extends to human rape as well: Ovid's account of Tarquinius' rape of Lucretia (Fasti 2.791-836) is told from the woman's perspective, and presents a vivid picture of the horrific nature of the act, and the terrible trauma that it causes.

Rape was ultimately a bad thing for the Greeks and Romans, both by force and by deceit, with the trauma caused by the former passed down to the children; with the exception of enslaved women, though, I'm not sure it was much more acceptable to them than to us - and realistically I'm not sure it's much less widespread a phenomenon today.

AskHistorians,"I've heard a few times the phrase ""there was never a WWI and WWII, only a single war Prussia started"". Is this the truth? Is it even a possible summary of the period? Or is it nonsense?","I’m not sure of this exact phrase but this is similar to the Churchillian interpretation of the First and Second World Wars. Churchill viewed the period from 1914-1945 as a second Thirty Years War where Germany attempted to secure itself as the hegemonic power in Europe. In both occasions it was challenged by an Anglo-French alliance and later required significant American intervention. Churchill certainly would have viewed this single conflict as the product of Prussian militarism (he goes into more detail on this in his history the First World War, The World Crisis, and the Gathering Storm, the first volume of his Second World War history/memoirs). To be clear Churchill is not the only one to have framed the period this way but his interpretation has had significant influence on subsequent historiography. And this really is a question that gets at the heart of scholarship on the two world wars. 

As to if there is any truth to it or if this is a possible summary of the period, is a highly contentious question amongst historians. While there are few today who will write about the World Wars as the same conflict (even Churchill wrote two separate series on them) there are some. In 2014 the History Channel in the United States did a miniseries called “The World Wars” which explored this period as a thirty years war and followed some of the major historical actors from their experiences in the First World War into the Second which was framed as the larger culmination of the events from 1914-1918. So it still has its use to be viewed as one conflict. 

As to if this is truth, it depends on your interpretation of Germany’s role in the opening of WW1 and if WW2 should be seen as a separate historical event. These are not agreed upon in the historical scholarship. Max Hastings and Margaret Macmillan are two who argue Germany is primarily to blame for WW1 (but acknowledged that it was not the sole factor just the most important). Others such as Sean McMeekin have placed the blame far more on Russia and to a lesser extent France. Or Christopher Clark who argues that Serbia is more to blame than is often appreciated and that Germany was really just reacting to the confused flow of events. 

When it comes to the Second World War there are also some key scholarly differences on viewing that conflict as unique. Gerhard Weinberg argued in “A World at Arms” that it cannot be viewed as a single thirty years war as Hitler sought very different things from the Kaiser and prosecuted the war in a very different fashion. It is the Hitler centric nature of his argument that makes it incompatible with the Churchillian interpretation. Richard Overy, John Keegan, and Martin Gilbert all share similar assessments to Weinberg. 

However there has been a growing scholarship that also seeks to move away from the Eurocentric interpretation of the Second World War which is a serious challenge to the Churchillian view. This expands to include the war in China starting in 1931 or at least by 1937 as the true start to ww2. Overy does this in his most recent book. Or other revisionists like Sean McMeekin in his recent look at a Stalin centric rather than Hitler centric ww2. These changes to historical perspective make the notion that it was merely a Prussian prompted conflict difficult to accept. I think there is still some merit in viewing them as one event because of the connections the two conflicts have and whether the 1919 Treaty of Versailles is really to blame for WW2 it certainly was utilized by some of that wars biggest players to justify campaigns in the 1940s. So there is a strong link between the two but as to whether the OPs statement is accurate is likely to remain a matter of deep scholarly debate for decades to come.

AskHistorians,"""You Can't Ask That Here!"": The Counterfactual/""What If"" History Floating Feature!","So one of the most popular questions that gets asked - and then removed - is some variation of the USSR and winning WWII solo, particularly focused on the role of Lend-Lease. There are ways it gets in just under the rule - ""What was the impact"" or ""how did Lend-Lease compare to domestic production"" - but we don't allow the simple ""Would they have won without it?""

The reason is two fold! In the first... *we don't know*. *Any* answer is going to be speculation. But the bigger problem is that it isn't something that can happen in a vacuum. We can't simply say ""there was no Lend-Lease!"" but instead a good counterfactual needs to account for *why was there no Lend-Lease? If there is *none*, we can't just talk about an 'all else being the same', but we need to explain why the US and UK didn't provide military assistance to their partner against Germany. Assuming a scenario where literally the only thing that changes is no Lend-Lease is *bizarre*. Did the US and UK just say ""screw you guys"" but keep fighting the war the same otherwise? How do you explain that!? More reasonable scenarios would need to speculate, perhaps, Britain making peace in 1940, and then the US only fighting a one front war with Japan after Pearl Harbor. So it isn't just a scenario where there is no Lend-Lease, but one where Germany frees up dozens of divisions to send east, not to mention production capacity that isn't being threatened and hindered by Allied bombing, and of course the aviation resources necessary to deter it.

So the problem is that *we can't* simply say ""without Lend-Lease the Soviets were [screwed/maybe screwed/probably OK/doing just fine]"" because Lend-Lease didn't happen in a vacuum. Any reasonable scenario needs to discuss why Lend-Lease didn't happen, hence why asking about its contribution gets allowed (we can talk about the numbers) but the more fundamental questions about being *necessary* get so complicated.

-------------------

But enough theorizing. You want the counterfactual scenario! So for the actual question of how the USSR would do without Lend-Lease... I'm not going to answer *that*. There are just *so many* differences required for that to happen, it ends up not being a scenario that focuses on Lend-Lease. Instead, I think that the best way to think about the problem is to consider ""*What if Lend-Lease was half the volume it was in reality?*"" It requires considerably fewer changes to reality to arrive at a ""everything else stays the same"" situation if we speculate that it still happened, but with small changes. Perhaps Germany was more effective at interdiction in the North and Arctic Seas, resulting so the Murmansk route was closed, and then unlike in reality Japan was far more cooperative with Germany in limiting convoys to Vladivostok, which closes those down too. 

Basically the only route ends up being the southern route overland through Iran. In reality, the Gulf route handled about 1/4 of the volume, so for it to cover *half* of what actually went means doubling its volume. It was a rough overland path, so that also means heavy improvements to infrastructure, construction of rail lines, and so on. That explains to us why the volume ends up being so much smaller. It is all they can get through there! To keep things simple, let's say things are halved across the board, even though in reality we might speculate that it would mean a LOT less of less necessary things and more focus on the core necessities, but hey, we only have so much bandwidth here.

---------------

So, with our grounds set *what happens!?*

Well, not much to start. There is likely very little change at least into the summer of 1942. Whether or not this impacts the delivery of the British tanks to Moscow in late '41, it is generally argued that they were not critical at that point even if well appreciated (See Alexander Hill in Journal of Slavic Military Studies for a lot of analysis there). Nor, probably, does it make the critical difference in the initial blunting of Case Blau in Stalingrad. By late 1942 though and into 1943, the impact starts to be felt. Less delivery of trucks and trains impacts the Soviet logistical and communication network. In reality, almost 90,000 trucks were delivered by the end of 1942, and so since we're halving numbers, we make that ~45k trucks. This begins to show in their ability to plan for offensive operations, and to capitalize on initial gains during them. Operation Uranus likely gets pulled off, although maybe a bit later, but Saturn and Little Saturn likely develop at a much slower pace. So *potentially* we're seeing a failure to completely envelop 6th Army in Stalingrad, and instead seeing them more in a big salient, with fears of being cut-off, but not yet.

Even if we assume they are enveloped and the pocket reduced (probably slower though), and the changes are simply reflected in the distance of advance by Soviet forces in that period, certainly by next year in mid-1943, the impact on supply and mobility really begins to be felt. This can be alleviated somewhat by prioritizing truck construction more and perhaps building fewer tanks, but this of course also means that offensive capabilities are weakened. The Soviets are additionally feeling the difference in the air now too. By the end of 1943, they have received only 3,900 planes as opposed to the 7,800 they ought to have, and the much bigger impact would be the loss of a full 30 percent of aviation fuel supply. In the real timeline, US was providing them with 60 percent of the total avgas used! It isn't just a tweak to air capabilities, but a *massive* blow. The massive increase of air presence by the arrival of the US would, at this point, have been of great assistance in pulling away German air resources, but it is unlikely that the Soviets would have been able to challenge German air superiority at quite the level they did, and this too is a serious hamper on their offensive abilities.

To be sure, they are hurting a lot more. The home front is much weaker given the drop in food deliveries, and while perhaps not *famine* conditions, starvation happens in many regions of the USSR, likely necessitating fewer call-ups as more men are needed in the fields to keep Russia fed. We could dive a *lot* more into the food issue, to be sure, and I might be significantly *underselling* the impact, but for our purposes I'm simply saying it might mean slightly fewer frontline troops. 

It is probably safe to say that defensively, the Soviets are in a very strong position throughout the front, well-blooded in battle and learning the lessons of the first two years, so it is doubtful that they would fall victim to any prolonged success by a German offense, although one perhaps would enjoy some local gains for a time given such changes. Talking about a hypothetical Kursk, or what have you at this point is a bit weird given how dependent that battle was on the specific disposition of the lines, which would no longer be the same, so lets jump up to 1944 as I think it makes for a better point to continue talking in parallel.

AskHistorians,How did Arthur Conan Doyle become a judge at the first Bodybuilding contest in 1891?,"First off, to clarify, the event in question was 1901.

Just like his character Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle was always something of an athlete, being fond of a wide variety of sports including boxing, fencing, golf (which he tried and failed to teach to Kipling), bowling, archery, rugby and most centrally cricket, which he kept playing into his 50s.

>I have never specialized, and have therefore been a second-rater in all things. I have made up for it by being an all-rounder, and have had, I dare say, as much fun out of sport as many an adept.

He had some concern about his weight in 1898, making a diary entry early in the year with just ""16 Stone"" (224 pounds, and he was 1.85 meters or 6'1'' tall). Later that same year he embarked on a ""course of muscular development"" with Eugen Sandow, ""The Father of Modern Bodybuilding"", and thus was an ""acquaintance"" of his by 1901. Thus, when Sandow had his 1901 competition for charity (not actually the first bodybuilding competition, despite claims elsewhere*) they knew each other; the other judge was Charles Lawes-Wittewronge, a sculptor (who specialized in muscular forms, [The Death of Dirce](https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-death-of-dirce-288091) at the Tate is arguably his most famous work). Both men were of renown at the time in addition to having personal athletic prowess (Lawes was a former college champion in running and rowing).

The charity here was to benefit the British wounded at the Boer War. The judging was set to consider all-round physique; that is, not necessarily the largest muscles, but the most resembling a classical sculpture of perfection. Gold, silver, and bronze statues were the prizes.

Letting Arthur Conan Doyle's autobiography take over:

>It proved to be a very big event. The Albert Hall was crowded. There were eighty competitors, each of whom had to stand on a pedestal, arrayed only in a leopard’s skin. Lawes and I put them up ten at a time, chose one here and one there, and so gradually reduced the number until we only had six left. Then it became excessively difficult, for they were all perfectly developed athletes. 

A magazine account notes the slow and meticulous process of judging:

>Mr. Sandow fairly went on his hands and knees to examine the nether limbs of the men, and not a point seemed to escape the judges, the audience watching with berathless interest.

Returning to the autobiography:

>Finally the matter was simplified by three extra prizes, and then we got down to the three winners, but had still to name their order, which was all-important since the value of the three prizes was so very different. The three men were all wonderful specimens, but one was a little clumsy and another a little short, so we gave the valuable gold statue to the middle one, whose name was Murray, and who came from Lancashire.

It ended up being that the winner, Murray, had no money, and Conan Doyle, being worried about him waiting for a train while holding a giant gold statue, offered to get him a cab. They unfortunately were not able to procure one, and they ended up getting a hotel, but not before a surreal early-morning walk through London:

>... it seemed to me more grotesque than anything of Steven’s London imaginings, that I should be wandering round at three in the morning in the company of a stranger who bore a great golden statue of a nude figure in his arms. 

Conan Doyle did get one more offer of note in a similar vein: he received an offer in 1909 to be a judge for the Jeffries-Johnson boxing match, but he declined.

(*) For instance, 1898 had was a Best Developed Man contest, won by Launceston Elliot, winner of the gold medal in weightlifting at the very first modern Olympics. Interestingly enough, Elliot would not have won the 1901 competition, as his physique was geared for lifting, not all-round balance.

AskHistorians,Was Harry Truman as callous and unsympathetic as he was depicted in the recent film 'Oppenheimer'?,"So, getting inside Truman's head is very difficult. Beware anyone who either just quotes Truman telling you what he felt (especially years later), especially with regards to defending the bombings (which he always did, and he got really irritated with criticism).

The Nolan film depicts a meeting between Truman and Oppenheimer that may have happened, or may not, or may have happened differently than shown in the film. If you dig into ""what do we know about this meeting"" very carefully one finds that the only accounts of it are pretty after-the-fact and somewhat contradictory and not exactly well-sourced. 

But if the meeting in question happened in October 1945 (which seems likely but even this is an interpretation of records), it came when Oppenheimer was in a highly-agitated state. Not about the deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, though that might have played a role, but about the future possibilities of war with Russia. Oppenheimer's concern was about international control — about avoiding a nuclear arms race and future war. The person who set up that meeting was Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace, and here's how he described meeting with Oppenheimer in his diary: 

> I never saw a man in such an extremely nervous state as Oppenheimer. He seemed to feel that the destruction of the entire human race was imminent. ... He has been in charge of the scientists at New Mexico and says that the heart has completely gone out of them there; that all they think about now are the social and economic implications of the bomb and that they are no longer doing anything worthwhile on the scientific level. I wanted to know if I thought it would do any good for him to see the President. ... He says that Secretary Byrnes' attitude on the bomb has been very bad. It seems that Secretary Byrnes has felt we could use the bomb as a pistol to get what we wanted in international diplomacy. Oppenheimer believes that that method will not work. He says the Russians are a proud people and have good physicists and abundant resources. ... He thinks that the mishandling of the situation at Potsdam has prepared the way for the eventual slaughter of tens of millions or perhaps hundreds of millions of innocent people. The guilt consciousness of the atomic bomb scientists is one of the most astounding things I have ever seen.

Which gives a strong sense of what Oppenheimer must have been like, and what he thought the stakes were like.

Now, it is Truman's (later) account that has Oppenheimer doing the ""blood on my hands"" thing. And is an alleged (but poorly sourced!) account from Oppenheimer, much later, that has Truman doing the ""the Russians will never get the bomb"" thing. I view both of these with some suspicion because both were deploying these stories in ways to make the others look bad to others, later. (And in no reputable account is it the case that Oppenheimer told Truman he wanted to give Los Alamos ""back to the Indians"" — the only person who claimed Oppenheimer said that, but never in his own earshot, was Edward Teller, around the time he was trying to discredit Oppenheimer. Teller appears not to have known that ""Give it back to the Indians"" was a popular show-tune in 1939, and so if Oppenheimer did say it, it was a joke, as if I told you that some people called me the Gangster of Love.)

But let us imagine that something similar to this exchange happened. You have Oppenheimer trying to impress upon Truman his seriousness and the danger inherent to what Oppenheimer fears is Truman's approach to the bomb, because Truman's Secretary of State is, Oppenheimer fears, a hawkish moron. Truman seems to not be very receptive to this, perhaps because he is listening to the wrong people (like General Groves) about the question of the Soviets getting the bomb, perhaps for other reasons. (Truman was far more favorably disposed towards Stalin in 1945 than one might imagine. He felt that the two of them had a genuine connection at Potsdam and that Stalin could be effectively managed. It is not until 1948 or so that Truman really started to ""harden"" on the Cold War.) 

Oppenheimer tries to use an emotional appeal — that he, Oppenheimer, feels he has blood on his hands. Coming out of Oppenheimer's mouth, this is likely an attempt to establish himself as some kind of moral authority on the future of this weapon (because that is frequently why he invoked moralistic tones like this, even though he never said he regretted anything that they had done during the war on the bomb, and had himself recommended the bombing of cities and help choose the targets). 

How does Truman hear this? Truman, contrary to what he himself would like to say, was clearly quite disturbed by the casualties, especially of ""women and children,"" from the atomic bombs. He did not, contrary to what many people (and, sigh, some historians) believe, actually ""order"" the use of the atomic bombs, but was rather peripheral to the process. He was aware an atomic bomb was being used (and the ""an"" is deliberate — it is not clear he knew that multiple would be ready to use), he thought he understood how it was going to be used, but it is not clear he truly understood the nature of Hiroshima as a target or the number of casualties there would be. In the days after the casualty estimates at Hiroshima came in (August 8th onward), Truman complained of headaches of the sort we associate with massive amounts of stress and psychological discomfort. He was not informed about Nagasaki ahead of time, and on August 10th he stopped all further atomic bomb attacks because, as he told his cabinet, he couldn't stand the killing of ""all those kids."" 

Truman didn't order the bombings, but he did feel responsible for them. He took his ""the buck stops here"" philosophy very seriously. One can complain about many things about Truman, but he was unusually willing to take responsibility for things done under his administration, whether he approved of them or not, and held himself with a sort of moral rectitude that is frankly unusual for the President of the United States (the point of self-impoverishment). I think he took these things very much to heart. He did always defend the bombings, and would justify them in the face of strong opposition (especially from Republicans and the military) in the mid-1940s — he could not stand ""Monday morning quarterbacking,"" as he termed such critiques (and there were _many_ critiques of the atomic bombings during his Presidency, as an aside — especially from his conservative political opponents; this is not how the politics of the atomic bombs line up today, but it is definitely the case of how they lined up in the 1940s and 1950s). It is an interesting fact to note that despite his defense of the atomic bombs in World War II, he was much more opposed to the future using of the bomb than his advisors were, for the rest of his presidency. He did not speak of the atomic bomb in really positive terms except for the day of the Hiroshima announcement (but before any casualties were discussed, before any pictures were taken from the air, etc.). In December 1945 he wrote a speech (in his own hand!) in which he described the atomic bomb as ""the most terrible of all destructive forces for the wholesale slaughter of human beings."" On the day he left office, he described the bomb as a weapon that ""affects the civilian population and murders them by the wholesale."" This is not, to my mind, a callous read on the atomic bomb.

So let us return to the Oppenheimer-Truman meeting. Oppenheimer goes to Truman, and tries to impress upon him that he, Oppenheimer, has a special burden, responsibility, and authority because of his special role as the person who has ""blood on his hands."" Truman, who frequently admitted he had little time or interest in scientists (he was, I might note, the last US president without a college education), took offense. Oppenheimer, in Truman's mind, was just a tool for a larger outcome. Truman is the one at the top of the pyramid — it is he who had oceans of blood on his hands. And he knows it, and is disturbed by it, and nevertheless puts on a good face and tries to move forward, because what else can you do? And he rejected Oppenheimer's show with his own show — perhaps offering him a handkerchief to wipe himself clean. 

Or maybe the whole thing never happened, or never happened in any of these ways. Again, this is not what I would call a very well-sourced event, despite being frequently referenced in works on Oppenheimer and Truman. You would be surprised, perhaps, how many of these events from this period are not very well-sourced, yet get repeated frequently, because they serve a useful purpose to the person who invokes them. And at least I'll tell you, straight up, that my interpretation in the previous paragraph is based on my interpretation of Truman and my interpretation of Oppenheimer — and it fits well with both of those interpretations, but either or both of my interpretations could be wrong. Because getting inside the head of a dead person, based on scraps of text that exist (whether they wrote them or not), is a tricky business.

Anyway. The Nolan film's portrayal is not ""inaccurate,"" in the sense that it is an interpretation and every line in that scene is taken from _someone's_ account. But whether those account are accurate, or mean what the actors in the scene interpreted them to mean, or mean what Nolan interpreted them to mean, well, I don't know, and I don't think anybody does. But you could say the same thing about historians' accounts of the same event. ""Accuracy"" is a tricky term to use for something like this, especially when one is asking about something that is self-consciously a work of art."
AskHistorians,"Not very long ago, wars of conquest were just an accepted fact of life and seemingly the right of any nation that could make a go at it. Now, any nation doing so is decried by even average citizens of almost every state. What caused this profound change?","> Is my perception that wars of conquest were just accepted and their morality unquestioned incorrect?

TL:DR, Yes.

However, the nature of what people think is a good justification for war changes throughout history. So, the Greeks might not have thought a particular conflict was justified, however, they might disagree with you or me as to what *did* count as a justified conflict.


 I think a good, comprehensive overview of this subject of the justifications for war is Stephen C. Neff's ""War and the Law of Nations"". I know this sub generally looks unfavorably on posts that draw too heavily from one source, but Neff is solid and his book honestly provides a much more in-depth view to the subject than you'll get here. Any excerpts in this post will be taken from it. That being said, Neff is a professor of the history of International Law, and as he might say, lawyers are their own cheerleaders, so the book tends to focus on the views of the 'intellectual elites' and what they had to say about the issue. 

But first, Neff doesn't really mention the first war in recorded human history (that we know of). This is the [Umma-Lagash war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umma%E2%80%93Lagash_war) This war was brought about when two neighboring city-states had a dispute over some fertile lands. Ancient Mesopotamia was not a particularly peaceful era, characterized by budding cities with defensive walls presided over by a strong man (called Lugal - literally, ""Big Man"") each jostling for more and better lands, though the people living then might not have viewed conflict in such 'realist' terms. A city's temple and accompanying deity played a central role in their affairs. People believed that they were only acting on their god's behalf. So this 'Sumerian Hundred Years War' was between the god Ningirsu of Lagash and the god Shara of Umma. Men fought and died, but the actual argument was between the gods.

What Neff does say about this early period:

>There is evidence that, between certain types of peoples, war was, for all practical purposes, a natural occurrence, having something of the regularity and predictability of the seasons. The most obvious example was the eternal struggle around the great Asian steppe-lands between agricultural and nomadic ways of life, a conflict as ancient (in mythology at least) as the clash between Cain and Abel and as recent as (comparatively) the day before yesterday!
>... That war and peace are opposite to one another m ay seem the most obvious proposition imaginable. But it is important to appreciate that this contrast has not been a universal feature of human social life. In particular, in situations of endemic or constant conflict between two peoples, such a contrast is not possible... In such a case, war would be, in a certain conceptual sense, invisible by virtue of its very ubiquity... The clearest example of endemic conflict from the classical world was the relation between civilized and barbarian states, which was commonly seen as one of natural and permanent hostility. 

We can see an example of this view (natural enmity between Greece and the Barbarians) in Plato's [Republic](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D5%3Apage%3D470). 


An important thing to keep in mind, in regards to your question, is that warfare is a collective enterprise, pitting one people against another. So there isn't a lot of room, especially in these early days, for internal dissention, though dissention did occur. However, there wasn't a lot of pushback against the idea of fighting wars against the proverbial barbarian. People didn't even consider it 'warfare' as such, but 'law enforcement'. The famous Roman orator Cicero stressed

>... that a true enemy must be a state, possessing 'a Commonwealth, a Senate-house, a treasury, a consensus of like-minded citizens.'... A pirate group, Cicero explained, 'is not counted as an enemy proper', for a pirate was the 'common foe of all'...

As such, the formal process of declaring war was employed only against organized foreign states, not against barbarians, brigands, pirates or the like, and the Romans did not believe they had the obligation of keeping the faith with such an adversary, this includes truce agreements, legal title to property captured, etc. 

According to the logic of Cicero, civil conflicts were also excluded from the category of war (because again, a civil conflict wasn't war, it was 'law enforcement'). This sentiment - a distinction between foreign war and civil conflict -  was shared by the Greeks.

>In Greece, there were two separate words used for the two types of strife: *stasis* for internal conflict, and *polemos* for war against foreigners. It should be appreciated, however, that in practice, ancient societies did not always draw the boundary between these two categories of conflict in ways that make sense to us. Foreignness was often seen in moral or cultural terms, rather than in a strictly political sense, as is now the case. That meant that foreignness could be, and often was, a matter of subtle gradation rather than of sharp distinction...A consequence of this outlook was that armed conflicts between Greek city-states were considered to be, to some extent, examples of civil strife.

There are some striking examples of adherence to just-cause principles in cases of civil strife. According to Herodotus, Corinth withdrew its forces from the Spartan side because of a fear that it might be acting wrongfully, thereby bringing a halt to a Spartan invasion of Attica. A more notable example occurred in 240 B.C.

>The Achean League took advantage of a succession crisis in Argos to invade the city-state with a view to overthrowing the government. The attempt failed; and Argos made a legal claim against the League for this act of aggression, with the city-state of Mantinea acting as the arbitrator. It is not clear whether the League consented to these proceedings, but the result was that Mantinea upheld Argos's claim and assessed a token fine of half a talent against the League.

Now, the concept of a 'foreign war' was not universal thing throughout the world. In Confucian China *all* state violence was seen as a form of law-enforcement. 

> Confucian tradition adopted the radically cosmopolitan position that China represented the one true civilization on earth. There was therefore, strictly speaking, no such thing as a truly foreign society. There were barbarian kingdoms on the margins of Chinese society, to be sure. But these were seen as, so to speak, dark corners to which the light of Chinese civilization had, as yet, penetrated only partially. Military action against these neighboring peoples was therefore perceived to be in the nature of law enforcement rather than of foreign war. 

To the extent people disagreed with this Chinese justification for warfare, well, I think we can look at the simple fact that there were revolts against Chinese rule, and some were successful, so obviously people disagreed with it."
AskHistorians,"WWI generals are often criticized for using ""outdated human wave attacks"", but so were civil war generals. When then exactly were human wave attacks proper and ""dated""?","Earl Hess’s “Civil War Infantry Tactics: Training, Combat, and Small-Unit Effectiveness” addresses this question very throughly in the context of the Civil War.

To be more specific I believe you are talking about dense formations and volley fire. By the end of the civil war in 1865 the predominate fighting formation in open-field battles or meeting engagements was still was still volley fire. This has nothing to do with tradition, it was used because it was effective. Even with the Minnie ball, rifled muskets, and what have you. Anyone saying dense formation of volley fire in open field meeting engagements was outdated in 1865 is confidently incorrect. Hess talks in detail about the transition from tercio to civil war formations, so if thats your main question this is the book for you.

That said, 1865 was only 49 years before WWI and you started seeing many transitionary elements towards that style. Other militaries made similar transitions from Napoleonic style to a more modern style. I don’t think there was ever an exact moment because the transition was organic. Let’s talk about some of those transitionary elements and reasons:

“Human wave tactics lead to lots of death” yes and no. Lots of people died from fighting in dense formations, but the inverse “lots of people would live if dense formations where not used” is not true. If you spread your boys out real thin so they are safe from artillery they are very easy targets for calvary or bayonet charge. You automatically fail if your objective is to hold ground.

Trenches: trenches are nothing new, but their prevalence and sophistication increased as the war went on. An observer of the siege of Petersburgs, VA would see lots of similarities to the western front. Huge trench networks sappers and counter-sappers. Infantry firing from trenches and rather large earth works with large amounts of deadly artillery fire. The occasional fixing bayonet and charging over the top. The only think you are really missing is machine guns. The use of trenches wasn’t everything though, in 1864 the battle of the wilderness was a meeting engagement with no trenches. This isn’t what you think at first, but the industrial revolution made shovels and barbed wire so much cheaper everyone can have some. Civil war soldiers loved hiding in sunken roads, fences, and earthworks. I don’t believe the union did much entrenching at the multi-day battle of Gettysburg, but with WW1 style armies you bet they would be entrenched.

Artillery: Artillery advanced a lot from 1860 to 1900. If either side in the civil war filled their artillery ranks with ww1 era 76mm field cannons, that alone could change the war. Napoleonic tactic where valid in the civil war because where there where fancy new guns, the most common cannon was the “Napoleon” cannon usually firing solid spherical shot. Improvements in the chemical industry changed all of that when HE shells became cheap to manufacture. The Civil War and before had exploding shells but they where expensive and used alongside solid shot, that wasn’t the case in WW1. 

Small arms: the overwhelming majority of civil war fire arms where breach loader or mussle loaded percussion cap muskets. These where a lot better than what George Washington had, but similar enough the same tactic worked more or less. Americans love their guns and there where a fair number of high quality experimental weapons on both sides. Thinks like colt revolvers converted into long arms, pump action and lever action rifles, experimental versions of clips and magazines. They made an impact with anecdotes of lever-action repeaters searing PTSD into veterans memories, but they where *really expensive* and not produced at large enough scale. WW1 was completely different with all major powers having bolt action rifles which have a similar rate of fire to repeaters. In the civil war and before, these high quality weapons where typically given to light infantry and skirmishers who could use them to high effect in irregular formations. This alone doesn’t invalidate dense formations. These skirmishers often don’t have bayonets are very vulnerable to calvary charges. Don’t underestimate calvary! It was being used 

Machine guns: there where apparently like a dozen gatling guns used a Petersburg, but for all practical purposes the civil war had no machine guns. Artillery had already been kicking the ass of dense formations for centuries, but a machine gun is portable enough to be carried by a light infantry squad and thats the missing peice for how how light infantry can defeat calvary and bayonet charges. Depending on the circumstances and nerve of the men, a bayonet charge can defeat machine emplacements as did happen in WW1, but at heavy loses. The final death nail, in a long series of nails is the squad automatic weapon or LMG. This weapon can be used offensively with maching fire or other tactics to dislodge an enemy from a defensive position.

Mechanized warfare: calvary that would feel familiar in the american civil war was still being used in the 1930s and beyond in some nations. This last vestige of napoleonic warfare was removed by armored vehicles that serve the purpose of a calvary or bayonet charge but better and at much lower loses.

Air: According to Napoleon an army marches on its stomach and destroying the enemy supply train guarantees victory. To do that in 1865 you relied on deep cavalry raid for both reconnisince and destruction (a confederate speciality) or routing the enemy and walking directly to their supplies. Air recon goes well beyond what cav can do. Ariel bombing or relaying Ariel photos to long range artillery to just shell the area eliminates a lot of the purpose of both cavalry and fighting a decisive battle. If general Lee could just use photographs and direct long-range high calibre indirect fire into the union supply hubs instead of risking Jeb Stuart on a wild goose chase, he would probably take it. When you can do that you are more content to sit still and not charge since the intelligence team is resolving the battle for you.

**money!** note all of these things that move you closer to modern warfare cost money and you need an economically industrialized economy to afford these. Into WW2 Japan and China has some small elite elements that could fully use modern-style warfare with armor, high volume HE artillery, fancy small arms, but both relied a lot on older tatics like mass bayonet charge; not because they where stupid, but because they where too poor."
AskHistorians,"In “Surviving Genocide”, historian Jeffrey Ostler claims that the reason for Seminole removal & the 2nd Seminole War was their practice of harboring escaped slaves, & fears by southern slave owners that Seminole lands would be used to instigate a slave rebellion. Is this accurate?","Yes, it's true to an extent. Like with all Indian Wars, the causes are complex and hard to trace to any one or two single elements. But the reality of a large population of formerly enslaved black men and women living alongside or even as part of Seminole communities was a burr in the saddle of many plantation owners. Before the First Seminole War, American authorities had tried to secure the return of runaways both with the Spanish as well as the Creeks. The 1796 Treaty of Colerain, for instance, included an agreement with some Creek leaders to not only surrender any runaways in their possession, but also to take responsibility for all those in Florida under Seminole control. It was preposterous, of course, but was a provision that at least the American authorities took very seriously.

Conflict between militias and other irregular forces from Georgia and Tennessee and the Florida Seminoles occurred during the War of 1812, and the United States took some Spanish territory as a result of that war. The defeat of the Creeks in the southwestern theater of the war also gave Americans more confidence in their ability to take Florida by force, if necessary. But there was more than just the typical settlement-creep going on, as well, though many Georgians and other southerners had wanted to take Florida for some time; in 1816, an abandoned American fort had been taken and manned by a band of ""free negroes,"" many of whom were formerly enslaved.

The mere *existence* of an armed fortress on the southern border of the United States was considered a threat to the safety of American slave owners. The belief was that its existence would stand as a lure to otherwise passive slaves, and would encourage escapes and other acts of resistance to white authority. Even John Quincy Adams, hardly thought of as a friend to slavery, described the fort as ""a seat of banditti and the receptacle for runaway slaves."" By 1816, the fort was a threat in other ways, too. as its location prevented the easy resupply of another American fort nearby. Several supply transports were fired on from the fort, proving that it was a credible threat to the security of the new fort. 

In what may have been the very first federally organized slave-catching expedition in American history, a small expedition under General Edmund Gaines made up of American regulars, armed ships, and allied Creeks, bombarded the fort, and a lucky hit with a heated cannon ball blew up the fort's powder magazine, killing 300 men and destroying the fort. The survivors were rounded up and many of the captured weapons and ammunition were passed onto the allied Creeks.

While the population at the ""Negro Fort"" was separate from the Seminoles, the loss of so many allies weakened the Seminoles. The black men and women who sought out a new life in Florida often acted as interpreters and guides, go-betweens for the Seminoles and American and Spanish authorities. Their loss was significant.

The next year, a newly arranged alliance of Seminole bands under Neamathla, a Mikasuki chief, threatened to kill any Americans who ventured past the Flint River. In response, Gaines, still the local American commander, sent a detachment of 250 men under Major David Twiggs to arrest Neamathla. After an inconclusive gunfight in November, 1817, a second detachment of 40 men was ambushed by Seminole forces, killing all but six men, including several of the soldiers' wives, which gave a much more widely popular cause for what became known as the First Seminole War. In addition to luring away otherwise docile slaves, despoiling good farmland, and killing American soldiers, Andrew Jackson drew the old reliable card of ""foreign agents"" to further grow support for the war. Fear of foreign - especially British - direction of Indian hostilities dated back to before the War for Independence. Of course, no such interference existed; the Seminoles who came into conflict with the Americans were doing so for their own reasons under their own leaders. The United States won the First Seminole War and under the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the Seminoles (at least those at the treaty signing) agreed to withdraw into a reservation in central Florida. One of the stipulations of the treaty was that the Seminoles would act in accordance to US law, which included a proviso that they would return any runaway slaves to their owners.

The Second, or Great, Seminole War was started as a result of the Indian Removal Act. The federal government dissolved the Seminole Reservation in Florida and demanded that the remaining Seminoles relocate to a reservation in modern-day Oklahoma. Between 1823, when the Moultri Creek treaty was signed, and 1830, when the Removal Act was signed, there were of course continued hostilities, and the Seminoles continued to ignore their obligation to return runaways. Of course, the major cause for the renewal of the war was that the United States renegged on several elements of the treaty, and had been slow or totally uninterested in abiding by their responsibilities for supplying farming implements, annuity payments, and food and repair for their tools. One aspect of the treaty for the Seminole relocation stipulated that the Seminoles had to be satisfied with the new territory, and after several representatives traveled to their intended reservation and saw the parched, worthless land they were allotted, many refused to leave. There remained, too, a sizable group of ""renegade"" blacks in Florida, which drew white slavecatchers to the region, as well. By now, pressure from land speculators and slave owners in the southern states reached a fever pitch, and the refusal to relocate was taken as a cause to open hostilities.

To wrap up, while the causes for the Seminole Wars were complicated, involved international politics of at least three countries and a hugely diverse group of American Indians, and black folks both born free and ""renegade,"" a central factor was the fear from slave owners that existence of a community of free blacks was an intolerable lure for their own slave populations. Removing that community was thought of as an act of self-preservation. Memories of the somewhat recent Haitian Revolution were very fresh in the minds of white slaveowners, but it was the combination of those fears along with the Indian Removal Act and the impatience of white land speculators that led to the Great Seminole War.

AskHistorians,"Did the Saudis actually fund and help the attackers involved in 9/11? If so, was their reasoning?","The crucial thing here is that “The Saudis” are not a monolithic entity. Like any country of (in 2001) 22 million people, there were competing government ministries, factions within the government, and numerous groups outside of the government entirely. Not to mention the countless ideologies and ideas that animate individuals.

The official and centrally directed policy of the Saudi Government was generally supportive of US anti-terrorism efforts during the 1990s. The Saudi government stripped Usama Bin Laden (UBL) of his Saudi citizenship and froze his finances/inheritance in the 1990s. But there was a tension which ran through all these efforts, the Saudi decision to allow US troops into the Kingdom in 1990 had been controversial internally and within the wider Arab/Muslim world. The Saudis were very quiet in public about the lingering US troop presence (which endured on a small scale until 2003).

Continued cooperation with American anti-terrorism efforts were likewise controversial. The Saudi government often did not communicate with the US about Saudi efforts to silence anti-American clerics or foil internal terrorist plots. The Saudi’s kept to themselves secret negotiations with the Sudanese to deport UBL. Although Saudi anti-terrorism efforts were in earnest, they were conducted independently. Nor were Americans granted access to detained Al-Qaeda figures such as financier Madani al Tayyib (in 1998).

This central government policy existed at odds with somewhat common sympathy for Al-Qaeda among the Saudi people, the clergy, and doubtless many individuals within government.

The US Government’s 9/11 Commission Report found “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded \[Al Qaeda\].” However, it is likely still true that most of Al Qaeda’s financing originated in Saudi Arabia, where anti-American views and theology were common. Saudi Charitable giving existed on a very large scale and with minimal oversight.

'No Saudi government participation' remained the official US line for two decades, though there was continuous speculation about the role of the Saudi State in the 9/11 attacks. Although Al-Qaeda was based in Afghanistan by 2001, 15 of the 19 individuals who conducted the 9/11 attacks were Saudi Arabian, as was UBL himself.

Most of the subsequent speculation about possible Saudi state involvement is very silly conspiracy theories. But the phrasing “Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials” led many to believe there was evidence linking non-senior Saudi officials to the attacks. This theory has been confirmed by subsequent document releases which show several connections.

The most significant connection is from Saudi Ambassador to Washington Prince Bandar bin Sultan and his wife, who provided $140,000 (ostensibly for medical expenses) to the wife of Osama Basnan, Basnan then passed funds on to Omar al-Bayoumi. Al-Bayoumi was a Saudi intelligence agent living in San Diego who personally provided significant and repeated support to two hijackers, while communicating with an Al-Qaeda logistics manager. This was revealed in documents released in 2022. Prince Bandar was subsequently implicated in unrelated money laundering on a large scale. The FBI concluded there was a ""50/50 chance"" that al-Bayoumi knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. An FBI report also stated Al-Bayoumi and a second Saudi state employee (a religious official with the Saudi consulate in LA) may have been directed by Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah, a higher ranking Saudi diplomat in Washington to help the two hijackers. But in this instance, like the others, there is no definitive involvement in the attacks, only numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence.

So while I would not say “The Saudis” generally funded and helped the attackers. Some Saudi Arabians funded, helped, and carried out the 9/11 attacks.

A useful analogy for our primarily American readership is the January 6th attack on the US Capitol Building. I think it would be odd to say “the Americans” funded and helped the attack. But some US elected officials, law enforcement officers, and serving members of the US military did participate in the attack.

AskHistorians,"In Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" there is a passage where he describes celtic or saxon people worshiping a kid like a God, sacrificing him, and then parading his corpse as a sacred relic. Is this based on any historical practice?","For the Celts, the answer is pretty much no. 

We have extremely limited information about a pre-Christian Celtic religion or spiritual practice. The most concrete source we have is Caesar's description of Celtic gods in *[Commentarii de Bello Gallico](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0001%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D17)*, in which he tells about their gods using the Roman names.

>They worship as their divinity, Mercury in particular, and have many images of him, and regard him as the inventor of all arts, they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches, and believe him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions. Next to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter , and Minerva; respecting these deities they have for the most part the same belief as other nations: that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva imparts the invention of manufactures, that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty of the heavenly powers; that Mars presides over wars. To him, when they have determined to engage in battle, they commonly vow those things which they shall take in war. When they have conquered, they sacrifice whatever captured animals may have survived the conflict, and collect the other things into one place. In many states you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated spots; nor does it often happen that any one, disregarding the sanctity of the case, dares either to secrete in his house things captured, or take away those deposited; and the most severe punishment, with torture, has been established for such a deed....All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis....

Outside of that, we have a handful of Classical sources that talk about how the Celts performed sacrifices: Posidonious writes that the druids would interpret death throes of sacrificed men for divination; Lucan and a commentary on Lucan provides us the names of Celtic gods Esus, Toutatis and Taranis and tells us that sacrifices to Esus were hanged, Toutatis were drowned and Taranis were burned. Caesar also tells us about the infamous [Wicker Man.](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0001%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D16)

For the most part, scholars (at least in Celtic Studies!) are skeptical about the validity of these claims. I've talked about that a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cdso72/how_much_of_continental_celtic_culture_survived/), in a previous answer, as well as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6s1wxa/the_gallic_armies_that_caesar_faced_are/dl9z5jy/?context=3). But in brief: Caesar's depiction can be viewed to be politically motivated: he's looking for a justification for conquest. He's making a case for why they need to conquer the barbaric Celtics. It's possible that his description is heavily exaggerated, or indeed entirely fabricated, in order to further his own political agenda. It's harder to ascribe motivations to the other writers (though there has been some argument made that they essentially all just copied each other's accounts, though as I'm not a Classicist I don't feel qualified to assess the validity of that argument.)

So, outside of potentially biased Classical sources what evidence do we have? 

The answer is, unfortunately, pretty much nothing. We have names that we believe to be the names of gods & goddesses, we have items we believe depict gods - like the [Gundestrup Cauldron](https://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-early-iron-age/the-gundestrup-cauldron/). We do have bodies that appear to have been sacrificed, but as far as I know we don't have any children. 

But we don't have any records of practice, no known set of beliefs, nothing that tells us how they worshiped or even who they worshiped: we don't even have a pantheon. So, do we have any records of a historical practice of people worshiping a child, sacrificing him and then considering the corpse a relic? No, because we don't have any records of worship practices. Maybe people worshiped victims before they were sacrificed, but we have no evidence of that, because we don't know how they were treated before they were sacrificed. 

I do know that some bog bodies found in northern Germany and Denmark appear to both be sacrificed and be relatively young - sort of 'tween' age. It's not quite a child, but definitely a sacrifice, so that might be close? It's a bit out of my realm of expertise though, as that region isn't Celtic.

AskHistorians,"after leaving the concentration camp, how was the integration of former prisoners into society?","While there's so much to be said about this topic, I'm going to mention one specific incident that might illustrate some difficulties with reintegration that you might not be familiar with.

As you may know, pre-war Poland had a Jewish population around three and a half million.  During the Holocaust around 98% of them were killed.  Several thousand made it back to Poland afterwards, joining those few who had survived in place and those who had fled to Poland from genocide in other countries.

In July of 1946, just over a year since the end of the war, there were about 200 Jews who had returned home to the town of Kielce, Poland.  Their former homes were no longer available -- a phrase that glosses over another injustice against them -- so most of them were staying in a building they had purchased for temporary housing.

A young boy from the community went missing for two days.  When he turned up, he at first told his father that he had been kidnapped (though it turned out he had just been staying with another family).  The community and local authorities decided that the Jews were to blame, and that they were kidnapping and murdering local children.

-----

This kind of bizarre and unfounded accusation is a centuries-old conspiracy theory called *blood libel* that is still used to this day.  Accusing your rivals of kidnapping and murdering children without any evidence sounds like an impossible slander that couldn't gain any traction.  But this kind of accusation *works*.  Some people will believe their enemies are capable of any crime, justifying any degree of cruelty in return as they imagine themselves to be defending children.

-----

The local authorities in Kielce sent the militia to investigate.  They broke into the Jewish housing and found that (of course) there were no abducted children there.

In any halfway-reasonable investigation, this should have been the end of it; they searched and found no evidence of the supposed crime.  But I think their response to the lack of evidence is illustrative of the situation the Jews of Poland were in.  The militia and the hundreds of people that had gathered outside started robbing, attacking, and murdering their Jewish neighbors.  Many were dragged into the street and beaten to death, some were shot, some were stabbed with bayonets.

By the time soldiers arrived to put a stop to the massacre, 42 people had been killed and dozens more injured.

Then the wounded were attacked on their way to the hospital, then attacked at the hospital, then a lynch mob arrived to demand they be turned over, then people murdered several Jewish passengers on trains passing through...  Over the next year, the majority of the surviving Jews in Poland fled the country.

-----

To answer your question, in many places Jewish survivors of the Holocaust weren't *allowed* to reintegrate, as the genocide wasn't over."
AskHistorians,Was the Titanic actually a badly designed ship or was most of the tragedy user error?,"Hello :)

This is a complicated question, and it's impossible to answer without diving into opinion. To give as much as fact based answer as possible, it's important we understand things in context, that is - it does us no good to put our modern ideas/concepts/designs on people and a time who did not have access to them. Very often with this topic,  the question. ""why didn't they..."" can be answered with ""They did ... just not how you think"". I'll try and give an indication when I'm giving you. an opinion, but I'll also back that up with fact-based evidence why I think that :)

First thing's first, you write-

>screamingly stupid stuff like not having enough lifeboats

...and that's massively midsunderstood. I have written a long explanation of the Titanic/lifeboat situation before, and will leave it for you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zpjnpi/why_did_it_take_the_titanic_sinking_for_people_to/j1fqxue/). It's a good example of the many complex factors that go into the Titanic event, and why our attempts to find one big ""reason"" or ""answer"" always fall flat.

The Olympic Class Liners were incredibly well designed and massively safe - even though two of them sank! Let me explain.

Let's put Titanic aside for a second and look at her sisters - Olympic and Britannic. Olympic suffered far more damage than Titanic ever. would, both before and after the sinking. In 1911, [she collided with another ship](https://imgur.com/a/sS7KsMO) leaving her with a [massive, gaping, wound](https://imgur.com/a/YwdgJin). During the war, [she rammed and sank a u-boat](https://imgur.com/a/Oeo5FtA), towed a sinking war ship, and had a successfully career as troop transport ship. In the 30's she rammed and sank another, smaller ship (the passengers reporting they barely noticed the collision), and the next year retired with the nickname ""Old Reliable"". Along the way were storms and rough seas, one in early 1912 so bad that it ripped the 5 ton forward hatch cover off. The only complaints from passengers were seasickness. Olympic pulled back into Southampton a little beat up, but otherwise kept on sailing just fine.

Britannic- who had been converted into a hospital ship- was the victim of a mine explosion, sinking off the coast of Greece in 1916. Not an uncommon. or unexpected event during the way but still ... an hour after the strike she hit the bottom.

And that's key. ... *an hour*. If you read the answer I linked above, you'll see how quickly ships sank circa 1912. Compare Britannic to Lusitania, hit by a torpedo and sank in 20 minutes. Compare Olympic to Empress of Ireland, who collided with another ship and sank in 14 minutes. Compare Titanic to other ships who suffered collisions and sank in less than 10 minutes.

These are imperfect comparisons, of course, but they make a general point - The Olympic Class Liners were remarkably difficult to sink and even catastrophic damage wasn't able to bring them down quickly. And that's also key to understanding Titanic, her damage was tiny, it was just frighteningly, lethally, specific.

Even then her sinking as actually pretty boring. She slowly settled in the water on a relatively even keel until finally collapsing in the last few minutes. Some in the lifeboats said they were sure she'd float for days, so calm and stable she was minutes before finally plunging under.

So let's look at design. Titanic has become mythologized, so much so that we forget she was just another ship. There was nothing different or special about her particularly, she was built the exact same way every other ship was built. Had she lived, she would be the forgotten middle sister to the flagship Olympic and the largest  Britannic. Was she remarkable? Yes. Was she famous? Yes, but we have to remember she would enjoy that moment in the sun for a very brief time. As she sailed, Cunard and Hamburg-America were building and launching ships that would be significantly bigger than Titanic. 

So, like all ships, she underwent rigorous safety checks. Her entire construction was overseen, daily, by the British Board of Trade. The man assigned to Titanic was Francis Carruthers - naval engineer with over two decades of surveying experience, and almost two decades on the Board - whose main job was inspecting the construction of new ships. Carruthers had to act as the liaison between Harland and Wolff, the builders, and the government - who approved every step of the liners build. This was massively detailed - Harland and Wolff were required to justify every decision, which included providing flooding analysis and projections. Flooding was frequently tested,  both the forepeak tank and double bottom were filled and tested for watertightness. 

The day before Titanic sailed, Board of Trade inspector Maurice Clark came aboard for a final inspection and to comb Titanic over with the finest of tooth combs.  Second officer Charles Lightoller describes his. visit-

>a nuisance....made us fork out every detail. Life preservers throughout the ship, all the boats turned out, uncovered, all the tanks examined, all the breakers examined, oars counted, boats turned out,  rudders tried, all the the davits tried.  There was innumerable details work. He certainly lived up to his reputation of being the best cursed B.O.T representative in the south of England at that time""

Clark got so specific that he did a stability test, a process that required a pendulum on a string and having crew move from one side of Titanic to another to see how the weight shift affected the tilt of the pendulum. All this on top of the standard lifeboat tests and drills.  Clark signed off, Titanic had government approval to sail, and off she went the next day.

After the sinking, Carruthers testified at the Inquiries, in which he went into incredible detail about the process of certifying Titanic. It's interesting stuff, but one part sticks out. Harland and Wolff had built Titanic so safe they had the option to apply to carry less safety equipment aboard -  and they did not take that option. Titanic therefore, was overly safe - Harland and Wolff chose to send her out with far more safety features than were required. 

So respected was Carruthers that during his testimony when one official pushed him on how closely he had inspected the watertight doors, his fellow board members admonished him for insinuating he had been lax in duty. 

There are many different opinions as to what sank Titanic, but poor design can not realistically be proposed as one of them - not after you read the intense scrutiny she went through every step of construction. Was there more they could do? Sure- and they did them after. ie: a double hull not just a double bottom and extending the watertight doors much higher.  That is hindsight, and before Titanic would be argued as overkill on a ship that was already going overkill on safety.

EDIT: Since this has gotten some attention, I'd like to throw out one of my favorite fun facts. Post Titanic, Olympic was refitted with massive safety features - full double hull, extended water tight bulkheads, an extra compartment, davits that held lifeboat space for everybody, etc, etc. When all this was finished 11 months after the Titanic disaster - [you'll never guess what word they used to describe her](https://imgur.com/a/aMjFPEc)

EDIT: Thank you very much everyone for the awards (Argentium… what!?). I will try very hard to reply to my very full inbox but it might take me awhile to answer all your questions so…. Hold tight.

AskHistorians,"There's a centuries-long European tradition of people being jailed, writing entire books while imprisoned, and their work being subsequently published. How did they manage it?","Our current ideas and methods  of jailing people bear little resemblance to what the practice looked like for much of European history.  Our prisons are industrialized, bureaucratized, permanent institutions governed by incredibly strict regulations.  There is  a strong egalitarian streak underlying it - all prisoners in a given institution are at least theoretically supposed to be treated equally regardless of  social status.  Great emphasis is placed on controlling their behavior, enforcing a strict regimen, and strictly controlling what items pass into or out of the prison.

This is not how imprisonment would have worked in a great many historical contexts.  Imprisonment was often carried out in a much more casual, ad hoc fashion, and treatment of prisoners often had an enormous status component.  Gentlemen, the wealthy, or otherwise well regarded people might be given accommodations according to their station (and the degree to which they were politically in or out of favor), even when jailed for very serious crimes.  This could mean well furnished apartments, servants, an ordinary wardrobe, relatively free access to visitors, and generally liberal controls on their behavior.  Significant intrusion into their personal affairs by guards would have been seen as disrespectful and hostile to the social order.  

An imprisoned noble was still usually a noble more than they were a prisoner in terms of their place in the social hierarchy and the respect they were due.   They would also have the opportunity to leverage their wealth for better treatment in ways that we would now consider corrupt, but would not have been viewed in the same light at the time. 

They might not even be kept in a ""prison"", per se - medieval and early modern incarceration usually took place in a multi-purpose ""strong house"" of some sort, which was not a purpose built prison.  That might be a monastery, palace, fort/castle, manor house (sometimes even the prisoner's own manor house), etc.  

I will use the Tower of London as an example, because a *lot* of notable people have been imprisoned there and many things were written there.  I'm also using this as an example because the Paine's revolutionary Luxembourg Prison was something of an exception, far more ""prison like"" than many contemporary alternatives (though Paine was *still* permitted servants, though he declined - it's not hard to see how writing materials would have been easily requested).  I'm also not going to use Thomas Paine's ""In Defense of Reason"" as an example, because Thomas Paine did not write ""In Defense of Reason"".  He wrote ""The Age of Reason"", and he mostly did not write it in prison at all.  Part one was written immediately prior to his sentence, and part two immediately after.  While he did work on it in prison to some degree, his health was poor.

The Tower of London was not just a prison.  It was a palace, an armory, a mint, a center of government, and more.  It had areas we'd consider ""dungeony"", but it also had a great many areas for holding people that we would consider ""apartments"" more than ""cells"".  The treatment a prisoner might expect would differ *wildly* by circumstance - a sensitive political prisoner of status would be treated practically as a VIP state guest, be allowed to order all the paper/books/ink/etc they wanted, bring in an entire household of servants, receive guests almost unhindered, and generally do almost anything they wanted to (other than leave...).   A different sort of prisoner could instead be treated to an experience almost guaranteed to kill them via exposure sooner or later.  

Sir Walter Raleigh is a good example of the former type of prisoner.  He was a very famous man and a very high ranking noble, a man of incredible wealth and status, with an almost legendary military reputation..  He was also a traitor, having participated in a foreign funded plot to depose the King James I.  After the plot was discovered, he was imprisoned in the Tower, where he wrote ""The History of the World"".  

It's not hard to see how he was able to write when you understand the nature of his imprisonment.  He was given expansive and tastefully appointed apartments that had in the past been used by royals.  His wife, children, and three servants were allowed to stay with him and come and go as they pleased.  He had mostly  unfettered access to visitors (though politically relevant visitors would have been monitored and such) and mostly free run of the Tower grounds - he even was allowed to design and run a botanical garden on one portion of the grounds.  Visiting him in the Tower was practically a tourist attraction for the elite.   

The King's own son was a fixture there, and often (publicly) complained about his father imprisoning a war hero.  This was... politically charged,   and that should give you an idea of just how much leeway was afforded to a prisoner of certain status even when that might create liabilities.  He would have probably had access to any consumer goods he wished to buy.  He stayed in the Tower for more than a decade, effectively the King's guest in terms of lifestyle if not freedoms.  His imprisonment probably *helped* him write, because it posed no obstacles to scholarship whatsoever yet reduced his opportunities to be influential in other ways.  

For a higher status person, imprisonment was often no obstacle at all to writing, scholarship, and even participating in politics to an extent."
AskHistorians,What was the protective coating applied to American tanks crossing the Atlantic during WW2?,"I think he's talking about Cosmoline. It's a wax-like preservative that goes on wet like oil but when dried, becomes a thick coat of dark brown sludge. It was used extensively in the late 19th century all the way up to the Cold War. It's still available now but I'm not sure if it's used for preservation in the military. It is a highly effective preservative that stops the element from corroding military equipment; Soviet surplus guns dug out of decades out storage can be restored to like-new condition by just removing the Cosmoline. However, they are the bane of gun and militaria collectors everywhere because they are a major pain in the rear to remove. Theoretically they melt in heat, but even after a thorough disassembly and cleaning, you will still get Cosmoline ""sweating"" out of the wood stocks or out of the internals for no reason after months of use; it gets bloody everywhere. 

I'm not surprised that he saw Cosmoline get in the way of combat operations. A common failure of Russian SKS (semiautomatic rifles from 1945) dug out of surplus is slam firing caused by Cosmoline. The goo gets into the firing pin channel and freezes the firing pin in the forward position. If not cleaned properly, the gun can become runaway full automatic as the momentum of the bolt moving forward to chamber a round slams into the back of the cartridge and ignites, firing every single round in the magazine in quick succession. This can be extremely dangerous and draw uncomfortable gazes from people on the range next to you. 

The only difference I can see between his account and my experience is the colour of the goo. Everything I've seen is a dark brown, deep chestnut colour, not black. That may just be a turn of phrase, or maybe whatever gunk, sand, soot or dust that accumulates on the Cosmoline at its application in a US loading facility is a different colour to Soviet arsenals."
AskHistorians,"In modern times we use ""Beats Per Minute"" to measure heart rate and determine if it's higher or lower than normal. In the Greco-Roman world did they use a similar system to measure heart rate (i.e. beats per some unit of time) or did they rely on intuition for whether it felt too fast or slow?","Oh, before mechanical clocks were invented, the ancient Greeks used a water clock called a  clepsydra (""water thief""-- from klepto- + hydra)

Think of a minute hourglass, only with water, but it looked different,  The most basic was a small boat or other floating vessel that dripped water until it sank. This was used in Africa and some Native American tribes, so it's possibly one of the oldest forms of clepsydra.

In a more elaborate form, the receiving vessel might have markings that match water levels to time passed; this part may have been invented in Babylonia, and Egyptian clepsydras of this design have been found which are dated to the 14th century BCE: specifically, the one at Temple of Karnak.  [https://egypt-museum.com/clepsydra-of-karnak/](https://egypt-museum.com/clepsydra-of-karnak/)

So water clocks existed back then, okay?  By 3rd century BC a second vessel was designed to catch the water from a tight  conical siphon, allowing for finer time measures.

That is actually how the first heart rate was recorded, according to records. Herophilus used one for arterial pulse examination in the 3rd century BC

This research paper discussing the history of the arterial pulse is what you might want to look at. It has diagrams of clepsydras and other timekeeping devices used over the centuries. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51542652\_A\_Brief\_Journey\_into\_the\_History\_of\_the\_Arterial\_Pulse](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51542652_A_Brief_Journey_into_the_History_of_the_Arterial_Pulse)

As for the Romans, them too. The Romans developed a cylindrical clepsydra in which water dropped from above; a float within the cylinder would help mark the time against lines in the cylinder.

Clepsydras were used well into the Renaissance for time measurements; Galileo used one based on mercury to measure his falling bodies (a bit circular there: measuring the rate of falling matter against other falling matter.)  But Galileo also discovered that pendulums OF THE SAME LENGTH are isochronic-- their swing takes the same amount of time to complete one period, regardless of amplitude.  Thus, they can be used to keep time.

That discovery led to the invention of pendulum clocks (think our grandfather clocks, cuckoo clocks.) in subsequent centuries, as well as the first pendulum metronome (invented by  Étienne Louilié in 1696) which was soundless, but the difficulty of inventing one slow enough for a 40-60 beat tempo plagued metronome inventors for a long time.  By 1814, Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel solved the issue in his musical chronometer-- a pendelum weighed on both sides of the pivot.

Oddly enough, the hourglass with sand was said to be invented in the 8th century AD, but they were used on shipboard from the 14th century on, as the waves didn't affect its function as much, until mechanical clocks replaced them.  The design of a hourglass does require good glassblowing technology.

But as you can imagine, even the finest graduated clocks weren't super-precise.  Still they beat guessing or humming songs while while counting the pulse.  (This isn't a technique I find recorded at all for ancient times, though, probably because people would have had to measure the song's length and tempo by other means first.)

Although today, some songs are taught/used to help people deliver CPR at the correct rate (100 times/minute)-- ""Staying Alive"" is one.

No. it required the development of more precise timekeeping to actually record heart rate variability. (Mechanical clocks weren't super-accurate at first either.)

This began to be possible in the 18th century, when a physicians' pulse watch (i.e. a stopwatch design) was made, per this article on the history of heart rate variability.

AskHistorians,"Did the British Army ""acquire"" any important American artifacts before they burned Washington DC during the War of 1812? If so, are they still in the British Museum today?","Most of the looting -- and we know for certain there was some -- was of the ""personal acquisition"" category. But there are four paintings that ended up in Bermuda, which Britain was using as a base of operations.

...

The British had arrived with a force 4500 strong on August 19, 1814, at Patuxent River to the southeast of Washington. The capital was clearly within reach. While General Armstrong had declared that Washington was not of sufficient strategic significance...

>They certainly will not come here. What the devil will they do here? No! No! Baltimore is the place, sir. That is of so much more consequence.

...there was certainly reason for alarm even to the lead-up of August 24; Secretary of State Monroe had done some scouting with calvary and [wrote a letter two days before](https://d1y822qhq55g6.cloudfront.net/default/_largeImage/WHHAJournal350018.jpg), that ""the enemy are on full march to Washington"" and more ominously ""You had better remove the records.""

Still, even in the morning of, there was uncertainty what the British would do; while James Madison went to the front at Bladensburg where the battle went very awry, Dolley Madison at the White House meanwhile ordered for dinner to be prepared by 3:00. According to Paul Jennings (who was at the time enslaved) in his memoir *A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison*:

>I set the table myself, and brought up the ale, cider, and wine, and placed them in the coolers, as all the Cabinet and several military gentlemen and strangers were expected. While waiting, at just about 3, as Sukey, the house-servant, was lolling out of a chamber window, James Smith, a free colored man who had accompanied Mr. Madison to Bladensburg, galloped up to the house, waving his hat, and cried out, ""Clear out, clear out! General Armstrong has ordered a retreat!"" All then was confusion.

There are others with varying details, but the important point is: evacuation was unclear and sudden; also, according to Jennings account, before the British arrived, there was some looting:

>I will here mention that although the British were expected every minute, they did not arrive for some hours; in the mean time, a rabble, taking advantage of the confusion, ran all over the White House, and stole lots of silver and whatever they could lay their hands on.

(Jennings was incidentally one of the men who helped save the famous Washington portrait. Dolley Madison gave the order to save it, but did not remove it herself as according to later accounts.)

The British -- led by Admiral George Cockburn -- arrived while the food was still set out, including, as described by a Lieutenant (later Rear-Admiral) Scott -- costly wines; Scott, by his own account, ""quaffed off at Mr. Madison's expense"".

One of Madison's hats made its way to the Admiral; Scott also mentions a ""small portrait of the President's lady"" which seems to have been absconded with; portraits of James were also stolen, as well as a dress sword. One person after dinner reportedly used the tablecloth as a sack and nicked the silverware.

Of course, there were other buildings than just the White House. The Admiral also nicked a book. We know this because in 1940 a collector gave the Library of Congress a book entitled _An Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of the United States for the Year 1810_ which was, as the cover declares

>Taken in President's room in the Capitol, at the destruction of that building by the British, on the capture of Washington 24th August 1814

with the further provenance that it was given by Admiral Cockburn himself to ""his Eldest Brother Sir James Cockburn of Langton Bart Governor of Bermuda"". (You can find all the pages of the book at the Library of Congress [here](https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbc0001.2013gen56773/?st=gallery).)

The acquisition most resembling the original question is one that perhaps the Americans didn't want. Dr Edward Harris (of the National Museum of Bermuda) [mentions four paintings](https://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=107406&article_id=1031179&view=articleBrowser) found in a ""warehouse"". They landed on Cockburn's ship and back to Bermuda where the ended up at Bermuda's House of Assembly and the Colonial Secretariat.

You can see two of them at the House of Assembly [here](http://bermuda-online.org/HouseofAsemblyinsession.png) in a picture from 2020.

You can also see why the US has not bothered to request them back -- they're paintings of King George III and Queen Charlotte. The other pair is identical."
AskHistorians,"Did any captured Africans, on their way to slavery, successfully manage to not only revolt on the ship but seize control and steer it to land during the trans Atlantic slave trade?","The most famous case of this occurring is probably the Amistad. Africans that had been captured and enslaved in West Africa were transported by ship to Havana, and purchased at auction. When they were being moved a second time to another part of Cuba, one of the enslaved was able to free himself, free the rest of the enslaved, and start a mutiny that led to the deaths of all of the non-enslaved on the boat with the exception of the two owners of the boat, who were kept alive to navigate. The enslaved demanded to be returned to Africa, and used the sun to determine whether or not they were heading in the correct direction. 

However, the two owners of the boat secretly navigated back West after sundown each day, trying to return to territories where slavery was legal in an effort to save their own skins. Eventually, after a 63-day journey, they landed at Montauk Point, at the far eastern edge of Long Island. 

At that point, the US government classified the slaves as “stolen property” (they stole themselves?!) and were charged with piracy and murder. 

There is quite a story from that point - the case moved its way through the US court system before making its way to the Supreme Court, the ultimate outcome of which was that the slaves were ruled free men and sailed back to Africa on a ship named the “Gentleman”. 

So, there’s at least one case where after a long and arduous journey, the slaves secured their freedom and returned to their homeland. There’s a pretty good movie about it directed by Steven Spielberg - recommended!

AskHistorians,When did monsters get 'big'?,"In folk tradition, the size of monsters (and other supernatural beings including those often referred to as ""gods"") can be quite elastic. What is enormous can become smaller and what is human-sized can become enormous. Your perception of older equaling smaller isn't entirely accurate.

Some monsters - the Old Norse Jörmungandr also known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, for example - were consistently regarded as enormous. In other stories, giants could appear human-sized, with the hero often marrying the giant's daughter. At other times, the giant can assume much larger dimensions. It all depends on the demand of the story, but it is in keeping with this idea of elasticity.

Key to traditional stories about monsters is the ability of the hero to fight effectively them - and win. A hero seeking to defeat Godzilla or King Kong by the force of his arms obviously can't be accomplished, but this is an expression of modern cinema and how it has exaggerated the size of at least some monsters. 

Perhaps with this, we see something of the transition you are perceiving: traditional monsters tend not to be overwhelmingly large (except when they are!), while monsters of cinema are often enormous. Consider, for example, Tolkien's drawing of [Smaug and Bilbo](https://tolkienlibrary.com/press/images/Conversation-with-Smaug.jpg) from what I believe is the 1930s (a Tolkien expert can help with the date). The dragon, compared with the diminutive Bilbo, is simply not that large. In the recent film adaptation, [Smaug has become enormous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FocqBbPJ1cQ), well beyond the size Tolkien imagined."
AskHistorians,It's 1534 and I'm a commoner in rural England. King Henry just split with the catholic church. How does this change things in my local parish? Do we all just go along with the pope no longer being the head of the church?,"The impact of the English reformation at a local level is one of those topics that has been well-studied for a very long time, long enough for distinct and fascinating trends to have emerged in the historiography of this important period. The works that set the pattern for our understanding of the advent of Protestantism as a state religion in England date back to the 19th century, a period in which *all* dons teaching at Oxford and Cambridge (then as now the two main British universities, and the ones from which much of the most important new scholarship emerged) were required by statute to be ordained Anglican clergyman. Unsurprisingly, the portrait that they painted of this period was of a nation disgusted by the excesses of a corrupt Catholic church – one crying out for reform, which was enthusiastically welcomed when it came.

This image of the English reformation one was dominant for a very long time, but, over the past few decades, it has been vigorously challenged by a new generation of historians who have urged a great deal more caution. Nowadays it is widely accepted that reformation had no single impact at a local level. How it was received depended on a complex mix of factors, not least geographical location and the character of local priests and bishops.

There certainly *were* parts of the country where the old image of rapid and enthusiastic conversion to the main tenets of protestantism is largely accurate – these tended to be places where there were extensive contacts with the continent and, especially, with Germany, which was the main hotbed of religious dissent in Europe. Thus London, at the commercial heart of the country, east coast towns such as Norwich, and areas such as Kent and Essex that were heavily involved in the export wool trade, from which men regularly travelled with raw materials to European ports, tended to be the places where change was most welcomed, whereas the west, and the more remote and rural areas of the country more generally, are now generally thought to have been considerably more resistant to the new ideas. In the latter sort of places, reformation was frequently accompanied by dissent, grudging acceptance and, where it seemed possible, active resistance.

In order to further complicate the picture, a couple of key points need to be made. First, the English reformation was quite unlike the Lutheran and Calvinist reformations taking place on the continent in one important way: it was the direct product of dire political need felt at the very top of the system of government. The proximate cause of reformation that took place in England in the 1530s was, as is well known, Henry VIII's desperation to have the male heir that Catherine of Aragon, his wife of some 20 years, looked increasingly unlikely to be able to bear for him. That in turn required Henry to obtain as papal dispensation to remarry – a dispensation that, for complex political reasons that we need not go into here, was not forthcoming.  From the point of view of the man or woman on the ground in the typical English parish that you are interested in, the chief consequence of all this turmoil was that the new, reformed, protestant Church of England was set up as an established church. This meant that Henry, the King of England and head of state, also became head of the church. And that in turn meant that the coercive power of the state was, at least potentially, available to enforce the new forms of worship that the church produced.

Fear of what that might actually entail considerably complicates our understanding of what went on at parish level during the next two to three decades – as does the dynastic game of musical chairs that saw Henry succeeded on his death in 1549 by, first, his devoutly Protestant son Edward VI and then, after Edward's early death, by his equally devout, but very Catholic, eldest daughter Mary. All these regimes did make efforts to enforce state-mandated religious conformity at a parish level. But the main mechanism for doing this was what is known as ""visitation"", an annual check-up on the state of each parish that was supposed to be undertaken by the local bishop or his representative. Since England and Wales, between them, had about 12,500 parishes, and only 42 bishops, simple maths tells us that these visitations must have been generally very fleeting, and that in turn opened up opportunities for parishes to give the impression of being outwardly conformist, when in reality they were very frequently not quite (and in at least some cases not remotely) as in line with whatever was being mandated from the top down at any given time as church and state required of them.

To explore further, we need at this point to introduce Eamon Duffy, whose work in this field has done more, probably, than anyone else's to challenge the old Victorian-era consensus of a rapid and complete triumph of Protestantism in England. Duffy, as an Irish Catholic, was by his own admission predisposed to be sceptical of the idea that the Catholic church was either deeply corrupt or widely hated in the 1530s. And a fortuitous, successful late-in-life encounter with the driving test gave the previously rather cloistered Cambridge don  the ability to conduct frequent forays away from his  college and into the parish churches of surrounding East Anglia – where he quickly found ample evidence, in visual form, of the survival of Catholic imagery and practices in a very high proportion of the churches that he visited. The main products of his scepticism and of these discoveries were the two transformative works of history that made his name. The first, *The Stripping of the Altars* (1992) produced ample evidence to show that the Catholic church remained broadly very popular in England right up to the point where the reformation took hold. The second, [*The Voices of Morebath*](https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/266) (2001), is an acclaimed microhistory that offers a detailed look at the inner workings of a single rural parish, in the western English country of Devon, between 1530 and 1580. It's this latter work, I would argue, that gives us the best way of providing a clear answer to your query.

*The Voices of* *Morebath* is the remarkable product of a rather remarkable quirk of historical record-keeping. Every parish in England was r[equired to produce annual accounts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/myparish/projects/cwa/), which, since at least 1300, had to be sent to the local bishop for inspection. In Morebath, during the reformation period, the parish priest – whose name was Sir Christopher Trychay – chose to add his own written commentary to the accounts and the events of the year to the figures he submitted to his bishop in Exeter. This in itself is a remarkable bit of good fortune for the historian, but, even better from our perspective here, Trychay was both remarkably long-lived (he served as parish priest in Morebath from 1520 until his death in 1574) and a man whose own devout Catholicism renders his account of the impacts of reformation uniquely interesting.

The portrait that Duffy paints of Trychay is a complex and multi-layered one, and if you have a serious interest in this topic I would urge you to read his book. But, to summarise briefly, the Morebath that emerges from his portrayal is a parish that, while outwardly entirely conformist (Duffy notes that, through all the twists and turns of the reformation years, Trychay never once refused an order that arrived from central government) in fact remained very largely Catholic well into the 1560s.

This was largely down to the leadership supplied by Trychay himself. Thus, while he (reluctantly) obeyed the new protestant proscriptions that required him to dismantle the elaborate ornamentation in the parish church, remove images and icons, and dress himself in the simpler, plainer vestments of the protestant clergyman, in Morebath the newly-forbidden objects were not destroyed, but rather hidden – to be triumphantly restored to their old places during Mary's reign. For years and years, the Morebath accounts show, Trychay also badgered away at his impoverished parishioners, imploring them to make the donations that eventually enabled him to purchase a magnificent set of far-from-regulation vestments for him to wear in church when he conducted funerals. And, during the rebellious year of 1549, when angry Catholics in the west country rose up against the imposition of the new Book of Common Prayer, which was intended by Edward's government to impose religious conformity, Trychay organised in Morebath, and sent five parishioners, fully armed, to join the rebel forces mustered outside Exeter."
AskHistorians,"Lt. Hugh Clapperton rode across the Sahara with 200 horses in 1822, relying on springs and bits of shady tree canopy to cross from Libya to Nigeria. Today, that trip might not be possible. Was the Sahara noticeably greener/wetter as recently as 1822?","So, my research is focused on the Bights of Benin and Biafra in the latter half of the nineteenth century, which means I have a passing familiarity with the Oudney-Clapperton-Denham expedition of 1822-23 and the trans-Saharan trade, but nothing especially intimate. I had actually meant to speak to a colleague of mine who studies climate in the near future about this precise subject but have not yet had the opportunity to do so in depth. Therefore, while I believe my command of the facts to be sufficient to answer your question, I should like to make clear to you that *this response may potentially be incomplete*.

As far as I know, academic literature on the climate of West Africa in the nineteenth century is extremely limited and none of it is written by historians – only climatologists. In fact, while there may be other pieces which touch upon the subject incidentally or attempt to determine the historical effects of nineteenth century climate patterns in the region, I am aware of only three articles dedicated to the subject of the climate itself:

1.	Gallego et al. “An Instrumental Index of the West African Monsoon Back to the Nineteenth Century” *Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society* Vol. 141 (2015): 3166-3176.

2.	Nicholson et al. “Spatial Reconstruction of Semi-Quantitative Precipitation Fields over Africa during the Nineteenth Century from Documentary Evidence and Gauge Data” *Quaternary Research* Vol. 78 (2012): 13-23.

3.	Villamayor et al. “Atlantic Control of the Late Nineteenth-Century Sahel Humid Period” *Journal of Climate* Vol. 31 (2018): 8225-8240.

I am uncertain as to why this should be the case, but I strongly suspect that part of the reason lies in the fact that there is simply very little data with which to work. As Nicholson et al. observe in their work, there are numerous and valuable sources of information to be had in the form of “settlers’ diaries, explorers’ journals, reports of scientific expeditions, historical chronicles documenting the reign of centuries of kings, oral tradition, missionary reports, and government records.” Yet, even when the documentary evidence is especially thorough, as with the reports of Heinrich Barth or the various missionary stations found in nineteenth century Africa, it is still part of an overall meteorological records which, “is largely fragmentary, especially prior to the 1890s, as well as qualitative.”

Gallego et al., for example, do not attempt to catalog contemporary precipitation data, instead employing the database produced by Nicholson et al. as a means of checking the accuracy of their preferred proxy - wind direction. They attempt to infer the length and intensity of the annual West African monsoon, based upon the wind directions recorded aboard ships off the West African coast and compiled in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. Villamayor et al., though including the precipitation data collated by Nicholson et al., relies upon the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature data set, and other data sets, to supplement and refine their climate model of the nineteenth century Sahel. I claim no expertise in climatology – and would be glad of correction from anyone trained in that field – but it seems clear in reading these articles that, though it is surely best practice to employ multiple data sets to guard against error, precipitation measurements simply do not exist in the quantities we would desire and a great deal of stock must here be placed in proxy measures.

Yet, limited though the records may be, and reliant upon inference as the academic literature is in attempting to extrapolate from those records, all three of the studies I have cited are in agreement on one key point: West Africa, the Sahara included, was more humid and more wet in the nineteenth century. The precise duration and intensity of this humid period, as well as the exact geographic extent of the effect, is still debatable, as each article comes to a different conclusion on those matters, but each agrees that all signs point to its having happened. 

This would appear to be supported, anecdotally, in the text of other nineteenth-century travellers through the region such as Heinrich Barth. In Vol. I of his *Travels* (1857), for example, Barth asserts on page 383 that in the mountains north of Aïr, modern Agadez, “Here, indeed, a really tropical profusion of vegetation covered the whole bottom of the valley…”. On page 385 he reports of a nearby site that, “This valley, as well as those succeeding it, is able to produce not only millet, but even wheat, wine, and dates, with almost every species of vegetable; and there are said to be fifty garden fields (go-naki) near the village of I’farghen.” These descriptions are, in fact, fairly commonplace throughout the first volume, which covers the first leg of the journey south from Tripoli.

This is not to imply that the Sahara was, by any stretch of the imagination, Edenic. Barth nearly died several times as a result of exposure either to the climate. The desert was still a desert. Even were it not, there were other sources of danger ranging from the various diseases and parasites endemic in the region to war and banditry, both very real concerns in the interior. Nonetheless, given the limited academic research performed on the subject and the descriptions provided by travelers such as Barth, we may reach the exceedingly tentative conclusion that increased rainfall and humidity permitted a limited flourishing of plant life in the wadis, valleys, and other low-lying locations where water was liable to collect and which were partially protected from the full effect of the sun. Further research is required to confirm this conclusion and, **if confirmed**, to nuance it. However, while climatologists may find fault with the methodologies employed in the articles I have cited above, I can discern no basis for objection to their general conclusion.

Edit: Added clause ""of the climate itself"" to the second paragraph.

Edit No. 2: Substituted ""climate of West Africa"" for ""climate of the Sahara"" in the second paragraph."
AskHistorians,"In the fantasy novel A Clash of Kings (1998) by George R. R. Martin, the antagonist Ramsay Snow abducts a widowed noblewoman, forcibly marries her, and kills her in order to claim her lands. To what extent was this tactic possible, legal, and actually practiced in 'real-life' medieval Europe?","Obviously we're dealing with a fictional theoretical here, so it's hard to exactly critique it. The Middle Ages covers a wide range of time and geography, but I'm going to focus on western Europe in the Hundred Years War, which is reasonably close to the kind of medieval that A Song of Ice and Fire is/was going for.

The short version is that doing this kind of thing was absolutely illegal in most kingdoms - and definitely in England. See, legally any marriage between members of the nobility had to be approved by the king (or if he was a minor, by his guardian/council) otherwise it would not be legally binding. Now, that was how it worked in theory, in practice it was very common to not have royal approval for a marriage, especially between members of the lesser nobility. You see, petitioning the king could be expensive and slow while the punishment for not getting permission was usually just a fine - so it was very common to just pay the fine and move on. This also suited the king because, especially in the Hundred Years War, the monarchy was always short on cash and so a reliable stream of income was worth far more than getting involved in every gentile wedding in the kingdom.

That ""usually a fine"" is important - sometimes the punishment was not just a fine. Some renegade noble kidnapping a very powerful heiress and marrying her could spur a stronger response from the king. A king could annul the wedding and punish the offender (and any of their associates) - probably through fines but possibly something as severe as confiscating lands. To understand why a king might intervene in the case of some noblewomen and not others, it's worth considering the context under which a noble woman might find herself kidnapped and wedded.

So, as you might have guessed from the above, kidnapping women and marrying them while not common was certainly not unheard of. It is worth mentioning in passing that medieval noblewomen were often considered effectively under the guardianship of their husbands and weren't supposed to travel without their permission, so some kidnappings were actual kidnappings but it also wasn't unheard of for a women who was being abused by her husband to be ""kidnapped"" by members of her own family. Kidnapping was a pretty common element of legal disputes in England, no less a figure than Sir John Talbot had a habit of kidnapping people who were opposing him in legal cases and forcing them to settle before he'd set them free. Late medieval England had both a lot of laws and, in another way, a really chaotic method for resolving legal disputes.

So back to being a noblewoman. Should some nefarious individual kidnap you and force you to marry him, what happens next will depend on two key factors: how much land you have, and what your family is like. If you have inherited a lot of land, possibly by being the only heir to a prominent landholder, then it is very unlikely that your kidnapper is going to get away with his actions freely, but who will stop him depends a lot on question two. Firstly, in this case our woman is a widow. If she has any sons she can expect them to immediately intervene, some illegal wedding potentially denying them their inheritance is not going to fly. If you have daughters and their married, your sons-in-law should provide a similar motive for intervention. Alternatively, your brothers (if you have any) or your uncles/cousins could intervene to ensure that the lands stay within the family - probably by trying to prevent you from having any children (depending in part on your age, the older you are the more likely they are going to just stop you from reproducing).

Now, let's say you have no family and no children, well that could be better for you because now the King might be interested. In theory all feudal lands were the possession of the King and they could be rescinded or granted entirely at his whim. In practice, it basically never worked that way. However, when this did come into play is when family lines died out. If there was no legitimate heir to lands they generally passed to the King. So if you're a prominent widow with no children or relatives, you are a topic of *very* great interest to the monarch because he's probably rubbing his hands and thinking about what he's going to do with those lands when you die. He's certainly not going to let some blow-in take them from him, and since he has legal oversight over weddings he is in a prime position to crush this rebellious activity. Should your kidnapper then be stupid enough to murder you, you can expect that the King is going to have him on a scaffold in no time and be deciding which of his sons to grant your lands to.

Now, this is all assuming you are a prominent lady with significant landholdings. Should you be a minor landholder, things are significantly worse for you. If you have family and you were kidnapped and forced into a marriage then there is still a decent chance that they will intervene on your behalf. However, should your family not be able to intervene (maybe they lack the strength in arms to oppose your kidnapper) or you not have any, then matters are worse. The king isn't going to be as interested in every little landholding in his kingdom, and he may be more interested in the money he can get from fining your kidnapper than he is in breaking up your wedding. Whether the king likes your kidnapper, or likes someone who likes your kidnapper, will be a major factor here. If your kidnapper has no friends at court, or even prominent enemies, it's more likely the king will intervene, but it's no guaranteed thing.

The tl;dr is that this version of events is very unlikely. An illegitimate son kidnapping a prominent woman, marrying her, killing her, and then taking her lands is very unlikely. Especially the killing her part - once you're married he owns all your land so if he wanted to be rid of you he'd put in you in a tower somewhere and ignore you. Murder was still a crime, especially murdering a member of the nobility, and could endanger his tenuous position. Illegally marrying someone was one thing, that happened loads, but that *and* murder is pushing it - but it's also not like people didn't get away with murder in the Middle Ages.

&#x200B;

If you're interested in this kind of thing I'd recommend *Murder During the Hundred Years' War The Curious Case of Sir William Cantilupe* by Melissa Julian-Jones. It is a great, approachable read that isn't exactly on this topic but covers a lot of the same ground. William Cantilupe was probably abusing his wife and possibly murdered by her and in covering this weird case Dr. Julian-Jones provides a lot of context for what married life was like in fourteenth century England."
AskHistorians,Why don't Americans play cricket?,"They did! Cricket was popular in the United States from the colonial period, right through the nineteenth century. Soldiers from the Continental Army played cricket at Valley Forge - some claimed that George Washington even joined a game. The very first international cricket match was between sides from the USA and Canada in the 1840s. All-England sides toured the USA in the 1850s. The first Australian touring side, in 1878, went home from England via North America, playing well-attended (and profitable) matches in both the USA and Canada.

But that wasn't really your question, was it? Why was cricket supplanted by baseball? The answers I have seen are speculative, and none of them are entirely persuasive.

1. Cricket, because it depends on a (somewhat) consistently bouncing ball, needs a well-prepared pitch. Baseball, because every delivery is full-toss, does not have this disadvantage. (Objection: have you seen village pitches in India? Cricket can be enjoyed in a great variety of conditions.)

2. English and Australian touring sides were so dominant that American players gave up trying to compete with them in that sport, and concentrated their efforts on baseball instead. (Sure, but Australian / Indian / Everyone else sides were initially uncompetitive, too, without becoming discouraged.) 

3. Cricket was the ""Gentleman's game""; American industrial workers did not have the leisure to play (or spectate) matches that last for days. (Maybe, and certainly Cricket was and is less popular with English working classes than football, but cricket has never *only* been played in its long-format versions, and people will carve out time for the things they enjoy.)

4. Baseball is a better short-form game than cricket, which (at its best) unfolds over a longer period of time. (This is a supporting argument to #3, with which I happen to agree, but it's entirely taste-dependent, and even more speculative than the others on this list.)

5. Nationalism. Baseball was an *American* invention, and therefore preferred over ""foreign"" pursuits. (USA-ians do seem to have invented, and still seem to prefer, a great many ""original"" sports and other pastimes. This might be the most persuasive possibility.) 

All that we know for certain is that the first generations of baseball players were familiar with cricket. Many, if not most, of them played both sports - a friend and I researched the San Francisco Bay Area team that played against the Australians in 1878, and without exception they also played for local baseball teams; the first president of the (baseball) National League was an accomplished cricketer - but at some point baseball became their preferred sporting endeavor.

This is the case with many, if not most, cultural phenomena. Why, for instance (and to pick a deliberately frivolous example), did shoulder pads and hairspray become popular in the 1980s? You can point to specific *haute couteur* and celibrity initiaters of the trend, but that doesn't really answer the *why*. Sometimes people just like some things better than others. Once a trend takes hold it may last a decade, or a century, before its cultural momentum is spent.  Because the reasons for the preference are individual, and largely inarticulable, the question of ""why"" cannot be definitively answered."
AskHistorians,Why isn't there more Mongol influence seen in present day?,"Your premise is wrong, but that’s not entirely surprising. The Mongol Empire *immensely influenced* the areas and the peoples they had control over, and similarly changed how we today view and talk about the continent of Asia ~~(how often do we talk about the continent of Asia?)~~ Historically however, many haven’t been so keen to attribute any sort of long-term influence to the Mongols, mostly because that influence wasn’t exactly pleasant…

# Religion

Let’s take the Islamic world. All through the early centuries of Islam, Central Asia was a pivotal location for the religion. The cities of Transoxiana and Khorasan produced many of the greatest thinkers and scholars of the Islamic Golden Age. When Westerners hear that the Renaissance was fuelled by Islamic writings, they incorrectly assume these were only produced in the Near East, or, more correctly, in Andalus. The centres of influence where al-Khwarizmi, al-Biruni, the preeminent Avicenna, and many many others lived and died was however far to the east.

All that changed in 1220, when Chinggis laid waste to nearly every city in the area. None would ever regain their worldwide prominence or influence, not even Samarkand which Timur made his capital. Who today, when they think of holy places Islam, thinks of the cities of Central Asia? No, they think of Mecca and Medina, places which back then were backwaters, smaller than the suburbs of Merv the Great or Bukhara, Queen of Cities. A similar event befell Iraq—the annihilation of what was left of the Abbasids in Baghdad left the area a backwater on a global scale, which it has remained ever since.

But that is not to say that the Mongols had an entirely negative influence on the Islamic world. In the end, three of the four successor states to the Mongol Empire — the Golden Horde in Russia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, and the Ilkhanate in Persia  — converted to Islam (the Chinese Yuan dynasty being the exception). Muslim presence in India also strengthened, as refugees from collapsed dynasties fled to the growing Delhi Sultanate. A great portion of the strength and longevity of Mamluk Egypt was derived from their ability to stand against the Mongols.

# Geopolitics and ethnic populations

How about geopolitical influence? It turns out that the aforementioned successor states played a major role in shaping how we view Asia. Under the Ilkhanids, the concept of ""Iran"" began to become more prominent—the *Shahnameh* was appropriated in Mongol terms, and the Persian language itself began to ascend in popularity over Arabic. In short, a good part of the modern Iranian identity was laid down during Ilkhanate rule, despite the absolutely brutal start of Mongol rule in Persia (otherwise known as the reason many Iranian historians choose to ignore the positive aspects).

Like Iran, Russian identity was also forged in the crucible of Mongol rule. Somehow though, they took it even worse. The Mongol conquest remains the only time the country was conquered by a foreign power, and to make matters worse, they nearly immediately converted to Islam. The Tatar Yoke, as the Russians famously described the rule of the Golden Horde, was absolutely humiliating for the people and the Orthodox church. Never mind that a great part of Horde institutions found their way into the statecraft of independent Muscovy and Russia; their historians alternately ignored, belittled, mocked, and delegitimized Horde rule (some even pretend it didn't happen!). To this day, a great part of the Russian tendency for independence and hostility towards ""elsewhere"" derives from those two centuries of trauma.

Mongol rule also forced many of the tribes of Central and North Asia, absolutely shellshocked by the storm that had descended upon them, to refashion their identities into something new. Many of the identities that now mark Central Asia, and the differences between them (e.g. the pastoral Uzbeks vs the nomadic Kazakhs), date from this period of total ethnic confusion and uncertainty. One historian has stated that in this respect, ""Chinggis Khan was second only to Stalin in reshaping the ethnic map of Central Asia."" If that isn't an endorsement of influence, I don't know what is.

# Other stuff

If you're wondering why I didn't cover trade, cultural exchange (the famous *Pax Mongolica*), and other similar factors, it's because you're more likely to have heard of them, and there's probably a far better answer than mine somewhere in the archives. If you do want me to answer any questions, however, I'm here.

This answer was sourced mainly to my recollection and notes on Michal Biran's excellent biography of Chinggis, which focuses mainly on his impact in the Muslim world, but also covers elsewhere. Additional information comes from Atwood's magisterial *Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire*, and, of course, from Allsen's *Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia*.

AskHistorians,Why wasn’t J. Edgar Hoover fired by any presidents during his 48-year reign?,"Typed this on mobile, hope it’s coherent. 

This is a fascinating question, but like so many on this subreddit, it’s not one you can answer in definitive terms. 

The truth is, blackmail is only half the story. Hoover himself was actually an expert politician with friends on both sides of the aisle, as tenuous as these relationships often were. To conservatives, he was an ardent ally in sniffing out American communists and related social movements. 

To Democrats, especially Kennedy and his fellow social liberals, he presented himself as being useful in a very different way. Especially to JFK, Hoover was the face of professionalism in law enforcement during a time in which American police routinely declined to investigate or charge hate crimes (or instigated them outright). Given both Kennedy and his brothers were gravely concerned with issues of racial justice, Hoover was a rare ally in a fight which otherwise left Kennedy toothless in conflicts with local police, especially in the South.

It wasn’t just this time, either; Roosevelt was instrumental in making Hoover’s legacy, as he was convinced (by Hoover himself) that the FBI was a shining example of the efficient, ruthless bureaucracy the New Dealers wanted. 

I’m really sleepy, so I’ll probably end here if that’s permissible, but here are some quotes from Beverly Gage’s recent biography of Hoover:

“Hoover spent his first decade as director establishing his good-government bona fides; he championed professionalism, efficiency, high standards and scientific methods. So in the 1930s, Roosevelt saw Hoover not as a far-right reactionary but as an up-and-coming administrator thoroughly steeped in the values of the modern state — a bureaucrat par excellence…Roosevelt did more than any other president to expand the F.B.I.’s power: first, by inviting Hoover to take a more active role in crime fighting, then by licensing him to become the nation’s domestic intelligence chief. Hoover’s agents became known as G-men, or government men, the avenging angels of the New Deal state.”

“After the war, despite his deep-seated racism, he stepped up the F.B.I.’s campaign against lynching in the South. “The great American crime is toleration of conditions which permit and promote prejudice, bigotry, injustice, terror and hate,” he told a civil rights committee convened by President Harry Truman in 1947. He framed white supremacist violence not only as a moral wrong but also as an acute challenge to federal authority.

“…he promoted himself as the embodiment of professional law enforcement, the polar opposite of the Ku Klux Klan’s vigilantes or the conspiracists of the John Birch Society. Many liberals embraced that message, despite Hoover’s well-known conservatism. “If a liberal came in, the liberal would leave thinking that ‘my God, Hoover is a real liberal!’” William Sullivan, an F.B.I. official, recalled. “If a John Bircher came in an hour later, he’d go out saying, ‘I’m convinced that Hoover is a member of the John Birch Society at heart.’” …The height of Hoover’s popularity came during the Red Scare of the 1950s, when he emerged as both a hero of the anti-Communist right and the thinking man’s alternative to Senator Joseph McCarthy. Today, we tend to view Hoover and McCarthy as interchangeable figures, zealots who ran roughshod over civil liberties. At the time, though, many liberals viewed them as very different men. Truman feared the F.B.I.’s “Gestapo” tendencies, but far preferred Hoover to a partisan brawler and obvious fabricator like McCarthy.”

AskHistorians,"In 1994, Dick Cheney said that toppling Saddam Hussein would destabilize Iraq. Why did he push for the Iraq War on 2003?","From the Gulf War onward, American policymakers were stuck between two conflicting goals on Iraq: they wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they didn't want to destabilize the country (largely because this would end up benefitting other American adversaries such as Iran).

There appeared to be a solution to this problem via a military coup.  If one of Saddam's generals moved against him, then he could become the new (and somewhat more palatable) Iraqi strongman and keep the system running smoothly in the short-run while paving the way to a transition over the long run.  In the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, the Bush I administration believed this would happen organically.  When it didn't, the CIA made repeated attempts to instigate a coup, all of which failed spectacularly with Saddam killing off everyone involved.

After 9/11, the Bush administration's determination to get rid of Saddam increased.  They still instinctively reached for a coup as the silver bullet that would solve both problems at once.  Cheney requested a CIA briefing on the possibility, which took place on January 3, 2002.  As he describes it in his memoir:

>I wanted a better understanding of just what the CIA could do inside Iraq, and so I asked \[CIA Director George\] Tenet to set up a briefing.  On January 3, 2002, Tenet and two of his top officers, including the director of the Iraq Operations Group, came to my West Wing office... The IOG director, whose name remains classified, began with a short history of agency involvement in Iraq, including a botched operation in the mid-1990s that Saddam had crushed.  Then he moved on to a discussion of what lessons he had learned from its Iraq operations.  
>  
>At the top of hist list, he emphasized that covert action could accomplish a great deal, but it could not, by itself oust Saddam.  Any U.S. covert action should be part of overall U.S. policy... Covert action would be much more effective with military support... When CIA officers attempted to recruit sources inside Iraq, they were most often met with skepticism about our seriousness in wanting to oust Saddam.  If we wanted to establish an effective covert action program inside Iraq, we would need to convince the Iraqis that this time we meant it.

There was some hope in the administration that the *threat* of war would be enough to trigger a coup (Bush described this as the ""perfect solution"" to the problem) but, faced with a scenario where it seemed unlikely that they could have their cake and eat it too (i.e., get rid of Saddam without destabilizing Iraq), Bush and Cheney had to pick one or the other -- a decision that didn't seem necessary in 1994.  And they picked invasion.  

It's hard to say if Cheney would have made that same choice in 1994 if he had known the coup would never happen -- the regime looked a lot more fragile in 1994 than 2002.  The US also didn't know the full extent of Saddam's historical (i.e., pre-Gulf War) WMD programs until 1995, which changed the threat assessment.  And, of course, 9/11 had a big influence on how Cheney and Bush thought about the seriousness of the threat."

AskHistorians,"During the sinking of the Titanic, several passengers chose to carry oranges in their pockets when evacuating the boat. Why ?","The answer is .. there is no direct answer, or at least I'm not aware of Johnson and/or Peuchen elaborating on these anecdotes. What we do have, however, is enough evidence about this seemingly minor and odd detail to make an educated guess because, believe it or not, the oranges were news in the immediate aftermath of the sinking.

First, let's look at the Toronto Daily Star, 5 days after the sinking, in an article entitled ""Major's Daughter Reminds Him That It's His Birthday"" and credited to ""a Member of the Star's Women's Department"". The article is soap operatic retelling of Major Peuchen's reunion with his daughter, and focuses mostly on both what she and the assembled crowd were wearing - the clothes, the jewels, likening her to the Empress Theodosia. There is very little to do with the actual sinking which was, supposedly, what the story was about but there was lots to do with what Peuchen was wearing while he was telling the tale. Eventually, we get a glimpse-

>To leave money and jewelry and valuable gifts, and take three oranges and a tie pin is what one might expect in topsy-turvydom. To find a deck crowd of ladies in evening dress and the most unconventional of negligee, to hear of trousseaux lost and jewels to the value of thirty-five thousand dollars sunk in the sea from the possession of a single woman seems like the things one reads about but never touches personally.

It's not a news article, it's a fashion tabloid disguised as one, all ending rather dramatically with this sentence- 

>“Father”, she cries, “it’s almost twelve o’clock, and I haven’t wished you many happy returns. Did you remember, it’s your birthday?”

and..... credits.

Now, let's compare to Steward Johnson's account - which he gave at the British Inquiry into the disaster.

>Did you stay where you were?

>No; I put four oranges into my pocket. I might have done it after, but I think I did it then.

That's it. He does not elaborate, nor is he asked too. No one mentions the oranges, or follows up as to why he felt the need to. So what's going on here?

They key, I think, is to look at the similarities between the two men - and there some specific ones which might answer this strange orange questions.

The first is that both men were lifelong sailors. Johnson had been at sea nearly 40 years by Titanic and he joined as a first class steward, taking the overnight shift with a watch starting around 11pm. Peuchen was military and an avid sailor, having been Vice-Commodore of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. He was also an avid traveler, so much so that he knew enough about the transatlantic travel route to have misgivings about Edward Smith as Captain (although he seriously denied this, and yet it still damaged his career quite badly).  These decades of sailing experience would come in handy later as they gave him enough credence to be put in command of boat 6 and thus, save his life. 

But the stories of these men would intertwine on April 14th in the immediate aftermath of the collision. Both were among the few awake at 1140 and both remembered the collision. Johnson remarked ""Another Belfast trip"", thinking Titanic had thrown a blade. Peuchen said he thought Titanic had been hit by a big wave, and noted that was impossible as the sea was impossibly smooth. Both sprang into action.

Johnson asked fellow crew member Alfred White to go back below and find out more information. He recounts his return-

> He went down and came back and said, ""I think it is 
a bit hot"" - that is a racing phrase. He meant it was a bit serious.

He then went back through the dining room, and saw Thomas Andrews and Captain Smith. He followed them down and waited until they returned from below for news.

At the same time, Peuchen recounts what he was doing-

>I felt as though a heavy wave had struck our ship. She quivered under it somewhat. I would simply have thought it was an unusual wave which had struck the boat; but knowing that it was a calm night and that it was an unusual thing to occur on a calm night, I immediately put on my overcoat and went up on deck. As I started to go through the grand stairway, I met a friend who said, 'Why, we have struck an iceberg. If you go up on the upper deck you will see the ice.'

Peuchen did so, inviting fellow passenger Charles Hayes as well. Both men noticed Titanic had developed a slight list, and upon walking back into the Grand Staircase foyer, met fellow passenger Thomson Beattie who told him the boats had been ordered out. Peuchen returned to his cabin, grabbed his oranges, and headed up.

While all this was happening, here is what Johnson describes-

> Did you do anything after that?
>...I followed Mr. Andrews after he came up from the engine room.

>And he and the Captain came through?
>No, he came three or four minutes before the Captain.

>Did the Captain go down after him?
>Directly after.

>Did you stay where you were?
>No; I put four oranges into my pocket. I might have done it after, but I think I did it then.

>Did you follow the captain or stay where you were?
>No; I waited a minute and followed Mr. Andrews.

>What happened next?
>Mr. Andrews went through the saloon after this man came and told me it was a bit thick. I followed Mr. Andrews and went down to E deck to see if Duscheck was there. He was down there on watch in that deck. I went down to E deck and saw Mr. Andrews go down by the baggage room or mail room. One door goes down and the other does not.

>The baggage room is there, is it?
>Well, they were handling mails or something; when I looked there was water there then.

We pick up with Peuchen-

>In the hallway I met a great many people, ladies and gentlemen, with their lifebelts on, and the ladies were crying, principally, most of them. It was a very serious sight, and I commenced to realize how serious matters were.I saw the boats were all ready for action; that is, the covers had been taken off of them, and the ropes cleared, ready to lower. This was on the port side. I was standing near by the second officer, and the captain  was standing there as well, at that time. The captain said - I do not know whether it was the captain or the second officer said - ""We will have to get these masts out of these boats, and also the sail.""

Now, we have to note two things here. The first is that, in an article concerned with fashion and tabloid, the oranges are described as nonsensical. In front of the British Inquiry, convened specifically to examine the technical aspects of the sinking, the oranges aren't worth following up on. The second, is that both of these men felt the collision, had experience at sea to surmise that something wrong, investigated, and were among the first of Titanic's souls to know there was serious danger ... and both grabbed oranges.

Why? My best guess is survival. Oranges are light and easy to carry. They are protected from damage by a thick rind, and they float. They are also mostly water, so great for dehydration but also contain sugar and most importantly ... Vitamin C, necessary for the prevention of scurvy.

Both Peuchen and Johnson are experienced at sea and they know how dangerous being exposed to the open elements are. Remember, they know boats are going out but they have no indication when those boats will be picked up. Fresh water, energy, and a necessary vitamin that wouldn't be found in lifeboat supplies. Peuchen throws on a heavy overcoat and grabs oranges - warmth and sustenance. 

...of which they weren't even sure were provided. Peuchen also recounts that upon reaching Carpathia, he checked his boat for supplies in which he found biscuits and water kegs that he was ""assured were full"". Had the boats been adrift (remember, we aren't too far away from the days when ships just went missing and people never found again), the water run out, and the lack of vitamin C starting to turn to scurvy - the survivors may not have survived. However, a tough, light, self preserving, easy to carry, floatable, water filled, sugar/energy filled, vitamin packed food would benefit them greatly - and that was all found in the humble orange.

The orange story has a weird niche. It is often reported that Johnson told Peuchen of the collision and gave him oranges, even though neither men say this nor where they anywhere close to each other. They have also developed into an often told moral fable, Peuchen becoming a woman who runs back from the lifeboats, abandons her jewels (in some way) and takes the oranges instead - a lesson on what Christians should find most important. The details always vary.

In reality, the fact that two experience sailors both felt and saw the collision, and had almost immediate proof that Titanic was in serious danger suggests that their instinct to grab oranges was related to surviving. The fact that it's not questioned by the British Inquiry suggests (possibly) that this was a normal and unremarkable action - as any sailor would have known the dangers of the open sea.

AskHistorians,"I saw a tiktok (yes, I know) about how Eve being formed from Adam's ribs in the bible is a mistranslation and the correct translation is that she was formed out of his half or side. I googled but couldnt find any relevant information on this. How true is that statement?","Genesis has two seperate instances of god creating humanity. The first is in Genesis 1:27, during the sixth day of creation, where it says

""And god created humanity in their own image; in the image of god he was created; male and female they were created.""

(translation mine and apologies for the pronouns. Biblical Hebrew has a very unusual pronoun and gender structure.) 

This creation story seems to imply god creating multiple people at once in both male and female forms. The Adam and Eve story doesn't show up until the next chapter, once the seven days story is completed.

There is then an entirely different creation story with no mention of seven days, or formless voids, or let there be light or any of that. As part of this story, god creates a single man from the dust and sticks him in Eden. This is Adam. 

Genesis 2:21 says

""And god caused an unconsciousness to happen to Adam/The Man, and he slept, and He took from one of his *tzelas* and He filled the place with flesh instead"" (again, translation mine).

Your question is how do we translate the word *tzela*. 

For all Biblical translations, the best place to start is a concordance, which is a book that lists every word and every place it appears, so we can see how else that word is used. The best online biblical concordance I know of is Strong's, which lists 41 occurances of the word. Check it our for yourself here https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6763.htm

In short, an entire half is definitely the wrong translation. *Tzela* is not used to mean half of a whole, but rather some some part along the side. Mostly the word is used to refer to a side supporting architectural feature, sort of like the english word buttress, or a side room such as an annex, or a feature on the side of a hill, e.g. a ridge. It does not mean side like the entire side of a building or the entire side of a hill, just a specific long and narrow part of a side. It also refers to long pieces of wood, e.g. planks or boards. Interestingly, Genesis is the only time where *tzela* refers to a part of the human body, which makes determining exactly which bit quite a challenge. 

With that in mind, everything from this point is my own opinion and there is no definitive translation of the word in the Genesis context. But the text makes clear that what was taken was something from the human body that is not soft flesh, is probably long and skinny like a ridge or a plank of wood, and occurs multiple times on the side of the body.

I feel that rib is a good translation, but some other narrow bone such as the one of the crests of the pelvis could also fit the context well. There is no legitimate argument that god took the entire side of Adam and split him in half. It is unclear exactly which bone was taken, but a rib is by far the bone that anatomically best fits the description.

AskHistorians,"Anarchists were once prominent on the world stage, assassinating world leaders, forming armies and challenging governments. What explains the decline of anarchism after WWII from an international political force that must be reckoned with to hardly a blip on anyone's radar?","Reworking an [old answer I did from 11 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v55jxu/comment/ib8xwe9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

Benedict Anderson in his seminal book *Under Three Flags* (reissued as *The Age of Globalization: Anarchists and the Anticolonial Imagination*) wrote that ""anarchism, in its characteristically variegated forms, was the dominant element in the self-consciously internationalist radical Left"" from the death of Karl Marx and persisted up perhaps the interwar period.

But why did anarchism decline in the postwar period? In their cross-country comparative historical study of anarchist movements, Williams & Lee suggest that:

>After the war and the Bolshevik Revolution, anarchism went into a period of demobilization and decline as Communism gained increased legitimacy amongst the Left as a revolutionary ideology that was perceived to be succeeding in the USSR.

Basically, the 1917 Russian Revolution happened, of which the Bolshevik coup was an episode. After the Bolsheviks took power, Marxism suddenly gained a lot of new found legitimacy. Even in Russia itself, anarchists defected to Bolshevik-style communist movements. In addition to legitimacy, Williams & Lee noted that Bolshevik-style parties out-organized and out-competed reformist and anarchist rivals.

The Soviet Union also actively exported Bolshevik-style and later Soviet-style communism through its international organs of the Comintern and the Profintern. Anarchists simply did not have the resources of a state apparatus to compete with Soviet-style communism.

Returning to Anderson's book, we see the subsumption of socialists into the Marxist movement. Isabelo de los Reyes brought anarchist-inflected socialism to the Philippines in the 1910s, and anarchist ideas was quite popular, but many of these militants were later subsumed into the old Communist Party of the Philippines (PKP-1930) by the time World War 2 came. This example is a microcosm of what happened to anarchism and non-Marxist socialisms in a global scale where many organizations were basically subsumed into the Marxist movement.

tl;dr: The Russian Revolution happened, Marxism became legitimate, USSR exported its ideology, anarchists and others were out-organized.

AskHistorians,"Since borders in the ancient world were more fluid than now, was it common for communities on the outskirts of a civilization to visited by tax collector's from multiple states?","So I’m currently working on my dissertation about the contested nature of border delineations across Afghanistan and the himalayas at the end of the 19th century (the period known, somewhat problematically, as ‘The Great Game’). I’m on my phone and in something of a rush so can’t offer you a super full answer but hope it will be of something of an appropriate standard. I also can’t comment on the “ancient world” part of your question but I do want to say that your question really has relevance up to the late nineteenth century. The concept of minutely geographically defined borders enforced through the military arm of a centralized state is a decidedly modern phenomenon - that is, it is a product of European colonialism (and the actual enforcement of so many of the borders we take for granted today is something that is less than 100 years old, and in many regions, something that is still enormously contested).   

But to focus in on my own research, the answer to your question is very much yes. Not only would these communities receive visits from various different polities, they would make their *own* claims for increased tributes/more weapons/gifts/favors depending on who they felt would benefit their own political position. To take just one example from my own topic, the regions of what is today Gorno-Badakhshan in Tajikistan had a great many communities that lived and frequently moved across the valleys of the Pamirs and across the Amu Darya river. However, seeking to establish Afghanistan as a Anglo-friendly buffer state the British and the Russian signed an agreement in 1872 that arbitrarily decided that a section of Afghanistan’s northern border would run along the Amu Darya from Lake Zorkul to a point just north of Kunduz.  

Now the British nor the Russians had any means of actually enforcing this arbitrary agreement, and this caused great problems for the next 20 years. Subsequent Afghan kings (Shere Ali and Abdur Rahman) were infuriated by this agreement, so much so that Abdur Rahman actually sent troops into these regions in the 1880s to secure them for Afghanistan. Meanwhile, British intelligence reports from the time note that tax collectors and political officials from the Emirate of Bukhara were turning up in these regions (which the Brits called Shignan and Roshan and is equivalent to GBAO in Tajikistan today). Likewise the nomadic Kyrgyz tribes in the far east of Pamirs were being visited by Chinese officials from Kashgar as well as by military and diplomatic officials from Afghanistan.  

Additionally, regions like Hunza, which was situated right at the apex of Chinese, Afghan, Russian, and British/Kashmiri control had frequently changed their supposed economic and political allegiances depending on who they thought would be a more favorably ally. Indeed, I have read reports in the British library that the Mir of Hunza during the 1860s and 70s was simultaneously trading and arranging weddings with political elites in Kashgar, was swearing fealty to the Maharaja of Kashmir (so the Maharaja would give him guns and money) and sending messengers into Badakhshan (which was ostensibly under the rule of Kabul).  

Subsequent Afghan kings in the late 19th century tried also to claim sovereignty over the region of Chitral, so much so that many brothers of the Chitrali ruler (Aman ul Mulk) went into Kabul in exile and tried to press their claim to the throne of Chitral after Ul Mulk’s death in 1892. Meanwhile Aman ul Mulk was in constant negotiations with the Maharaja of Kashmir.    

Meanwhile, British intelligence reports after they realized the 1872 agreement was worthless were obsessed (and I mean truly obsessed, I’ve read tens of thousands of pages of this stuff) with figuring out which regions of the high himalayas paid taxes to which political bodies. Some communities south of the Amu Darya paid taxes north to Bukhara (which was a quasi Russian vassal by the late 19th c) and some communities north of the Amu Darya paid taxes south to Kabul. In fact, the direction of taxation flow often depended on whether or not Bukhara/Kabul even bothered to send a military delegation in any particular year to try to collect any taxes/get the allegiance of a particular regional ruler. 

Indeed, there was a particularly bizarre incident at the fort of Somatash in the high Pamirs in 1891 when Afghan troops forced Chinese  *and* Russian troops to abandon the fort because the nomadic Kyrgyz people that lived in the region were supposedly tributary to Kabul and the Afghan King (they were, of course, not tributary to anyone on account of being nomadic communities in an extremely remote part of the world). All of this caused immense anxiety and just sheer frustration amongst British administrators who could not fathom the fact that these were incredibly fluid and mobile communities who had no concept of fixed borders and a regular taxation flow.   

All of this would ultimately result in a British mission to Kabul in 1893 where the British were forced to pay a massive concession (huge yearly tributes and regular weapon shipments) to the Afghan King in order to get him to abide by a *British* conception of where Afghanistan’s borders ought to lie (this ultimately settled both the northern and southern borders of Afghanistan, which remain disputed, if not outright rejected to this day).  

So yes, these communities were visited by many different tax collectors/military commanders and these communities, depending on the year and the particular political and economic context they found themselves in, were making claims of all of these different political/military dignitaries, and these dignitaries in turn used these communities’ claims to further their *own* claims to sovereignty and territorial control. 

(Although I must stress again that it was only the British that conceived of territorial control as pertaining to hyper-science-centric minutely defined borders determined by geography - a product itself of the scientific enlightenment of the 19th century in Europe and the embracing of science by Western intellectuals and policy makers in categorizing and codifying virtually every aspect of their colonial territories through the lens of an “objective” science. This would lead most infamously to theories of ‘scientific racism’ which effectively justified the entire colonial experience in Africa, but also to the idea that borders and the separation of ethnic groups could be objectively determined, resulting in many of the highly problematic borders we see today in Africa, the middle east, and South Asia).

AskHistorians,Polls of the U.S. public from after the My Lai massacre was revealed showed overwhelming opposition to punishing the soldiers. Why?,"William Calley was convicted on March 29, 1971 of murder. Out of the 26 officers involved, including the commanding officer (Captain Medina), he was the only one convicted. A telephone survey was then conducted
on April 1, 1971 on the behalf of Nixon.

>Do you agree or disagree with the decision of the military court which found (Lt. William) Calley guilty (in connection with the My Lai incident) and gave him a life sentence?

>Agree: 7%

>Disagree: 78%

>No opinion: 15%

A follow-up was done from April 5th to 6th, also on the behalf of Nixon. It asked of those that disagreed, the reason why; only 15% of people said they both disapproved and thought what was happened was not a crime.

A majority, 56%, disagreed with the verdict and thought it was because ""Others share responsibility"". A further follow-up asked if Calley was being made a scapegoat (70% said yes) with a very important ""do you agree or disagree with"" question after: ""The soldiers at My Lai were only following orders from their higher ups.""

77% of people agreed with this statement, with only 9% disagreeing.

In other words, while there was a percentage (15%) who thought there was no crime, the majority of disapproval stemmed from the idea that Calley was simply following orders. This reflects the defensive strategy in the court case. The first strategy -- via the defense attorney George Lattimer -- was to imply Calley was impaired by being in a combat zone; the second, more effective one (for the public) was to claim he was compelled to follow orders to an extent he was not liable for his actions. The prosecution pushed back on this by implying he still knew enough right from wrong to deviate; for example, via [the prosecution's cross-examination of the psychiatrist Albert LaVerne](https://famous-trials.com/mylaicourts/1629-myl-talver):

>Q: Was Lieutenant Calley psychotic?

>A: No.

>Q: Was Lieutenant Calley neurotic?

>A: No.

>Q: Did Lieutenant Calley know right from wrong?

>A: Yes.

>Q: Could Lieutenant Calley adhere to the right?

>A: He had a compulsion to carry out his orders, to do his duty as an officer.

>Q: Isn't that characteristic of a soldier?

>A: Who else has done what Lieutenant Calley is alleged to have done? .... He proceeded to carry out his orders.

The defense tried to put the entirety of the blame on Captain Medina. Medina did eventually testify near the end of the case, and stated during the trial that when asked about killing women and children, he said -- directed straight at Calley -- ""No, you do not kill women and children...Use common sense.""

The strategy didn't work, and Calley was convicted to life in prison with hard labor.
 
The biggest pushback to all this was from the South. After the sentence was passed down, some of the draft boards refused to do any more recruiting. The draft board of Athens, Georgia resigned, one member saying that if following orders meant being convicted of crimes then they were not prepared to draft any more soldiers. George Wallace (governor of Alabama) investigated having the draft suspended across the entire state.

Radio stations played songs like *Free Calley*, *Pardon This Soldier (And Set Him Free)*, and *Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley* ([link to a recording of the Battle Hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JoacW7woBY)).

Essentially, the demand was: Nixon needs to pardon or we're out of the war.

The day after the verdict, Nixon (heavily dependent on the South for votes) ordered Calley released from the post stockade and placed under house arrest in the Fort Benning officer quarters; after 3 and a half years Nixon did a full pardon.

However, that's not quite all the story, because perhaps the most important metric shifted in the midst of all this. While the Gallup poll had always shown the public opinion on the Vietnam war had shifted ever since the Tet Offensive of '68, the Harris report still showed support, but two weeks after the Calley sentence was passed down, even that poll began to show a majority of Americans disapproved of the war.

AskHistorians,"Many people nowadays choose not to have children. Have there been other time periods in history where many people chose not to have children, or didn’t want to have children?","Finally, a question I can answer!

&#x200B;

Please keep in mind that my answer is largely based on my background as an economist since I'm not a historian. But I honestly think economics is the correct lens to analyze this particular question, for reasons I discuss below.

&#x200B;

Short answer: We are actually experiencing a period of unprecedented declining birth rates. This is basically happening all over the world as this image, and its associated table below, beautifully illustrate: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate)

&#x200B;

Very long answer: It's not uncommon for recessions, wars, epidemics, and other catastrophes/crises to negatively influence birth rates, as it's common for people to make reproductive decisions based on the environment/situation they're in. This is why it's also common for there to be a surge in childbirth after a crisis has passed -- just look at the baby boomers after WW2. ETA: To answer your first sub-question directly: Yes, it's commonly understood that parents facing the kinds of catastrophes or crises I mention would abstain from sexual activities that could result in procreation (so, they might engage in oral sex while abstaining from vaginal sex). As I am not a historian, I cannot direct you to a variety of older historical events that clearly demonstrate parents willfully engaging in abstinence, but there was a \*recent\* historical event in which that very thing happened in South America. As best as I can remember (I'm not an epidemiologist), there was an episode in the last ten years where there was a large increase in insects infecting pregnant women with some disease that resulted fetal abnormalities. I could not find any articles discussing this event, but I remember reading newspaper articles at the time that discussed how the Catholic church was urging people to abstain from sex to avoid giving birth to children with birth defects, and if I recall correctly, the Catholic church even temporarily approved the use of condoms (in the affected areas) for married couples engaging in vaginal sex. And, to be clear, when this event occurred, parents did in fact abstain from vaginal sex, or they accepted the Catholic church's temporary approval of condoms as a means to prevent pregnancy.

&#x200B;

The question of how many children parents should optimally have has actually been a popular subject in economics for centuries, with famous economists like Malthus chiming their opinion on the subject in the late 1700s -- his opinions on this subject were famously debunked, btw. However, the now commonly-accepted answer on this subject was first proposed by TW Schultz. Despite receiving a Nobel Prize, Schultz is a controversial figure in economics, a subject I'd prefer to avoid (it's mostly irrelevant to answering your question, anyways). So I'd like to give a generous explanation of his ideas and avoid talking about him directly as much as possible.

&#x200B;

The neoclassical model of economic growth has maintained its prize of place in economics, decade after decade, despite its obvious flaws. Development economists attempting to apply this model to both advanced and developing economies had to contend with the fact that birth rates in advanced economies were significantly lower than those in developing economies. This created a dilemma that perhaps only economists familiar with this mathematical model would care about, but Schultz, who was trying to understand why Germany and Japan recovered much more quickly after World War 2 than the United Kingdom did, was the first to identify some ""threshold"" of economic advancement (that he never clearly defines/explains but his successors spent decades researching) above which parents decide to have less than 3 children (rather than, say, 4-5). Schultz was also the first person to identify a negative relationship between the increasing price of a mother's time and the number of children birthed, which he argued justified the role for economics in analyzing fertility.

&#x200B;

While there is a common sentiment among laypersons in advanced economies that parents who make reproductive decisions with the intent/concern of having enough children to care for them in their old age are acting immorally, it's commonly accepted by academics that such a decision metric or concern is ""optimal"" or ""rational"" in developing economies given that people in these countries generally face significantly worse labor conditions and living standards, such as low-paying manual labor that causes their bodies to deteriorate much earlier in their life, forcing them to retire before their peers in advanced economies, or having significantly less access to health care, which means they suffer from conditions that their peers in advanced economies mostly wouldn't worry about. In this situation, having more children (who face a much higher mortality rate in these countries) is the only reliable means for parents to ensure their well-being in retirement. (Tangent: I have seen many Reddit users criticize people for making such a calculated decision and it seems they're utterly clueless about their privileged position as members of an advanced economy that protects them from having to seriously consider such a problem.)

&#x200B;

So, this obviously raises the question of what level of economic development is sufficient to cause birth rates to decline below 3 children per couple? TW Schultz never answered this question and I think a convincing answer has really only become available recently as we're now able to witness parents in developing economies reduce the number of children they have to levels comparable to advanced economies -- look at that image on the Wikipedia article I linked to and note how many countries are shaded blue, which is literally unprecedented. For more granular analysis, see the table on the same page.

&#x200B;

I haven't kept up with this area of research since leaving school, so I'm not aware of recent developments in this research that likely provides a more concrete answer on the conditions necessary for parents to switch from having 4-5 children to having less than 3. However, I think it's important to point out that there a lot of other important issues worth considering when it comes to reproductive decisions.

&#x200B;

First, it's commonly accepted (though I'm unaware that it's ever been ""proven"") that parents in advanced economies choose to have less than 3 children because they conclude that spending more time investing in the ""human capital"" of a smaller number of children has a greater return on investment than having more children that each receive a smaller fraction of their time. This issue is complicated by the fact that it's been well established that children who are the first generation in their family to attend college do not receive the same career opportunities or ""return on investment"" from attending college compared to their peers, whose parents attended college, receive. Meaning that parents of first-generation college students have to make a much larger investment in these children, either in time spent helping them study before they attend college (and maybe during college, but that's hard to credit given the parents' lack of college education) or in additional money spent on these children so they can get additional degrees (e.g., law school), which second or third generation college students don't need as their parents are able to use their connections to help them find better jobs right out of college and are better educated (because they have a college degree) so they're more equipped to help these children directly with their studies (for example, both of my parents were the second generation in their family to attend college and they regularly helped me with my studies, mostly by routinely reading/editing my essays in middle school, high school, and college; they weren't able to help me with the math I needed as an economics student, but having someone willing to read/edit most of my essays was a huge boost that most first generation college students don't receive). There are more issues to consider in this area, but I'm going to move onto other topics of concern.

&#x200B;

AskHistorians,I know that the Korean spoken in north and south Korea have deviated a bit from each other in the 70 years that the nation has been divided. Did anything similar happen in the 40 years Germany was divided into east and west?,"In short: Not really. East Germany did develop a few dozen uniquely East German terms and slang words, many of them in reference to the country's distinct political system, but there was no genuine divergence of the German language.

There was always interchange between West and East Germany. West Germans were, albeit with border checks and general administrative hassle, allowed to cross the border, and East Germans regularly consumed West German radio and television programs, circumventing state censorship. The division between the two countries never reached the level of the Korean divide, as East Germany never adopted the Juche-style seclusive nationalism which has shaped North Korea since at least the end of the Cold War. That said, I cannot comment on the Korean language, so I do not know just how different NK Korean and SK Korean are from each other.

The most linguistic differences that existed between FRG and GDR was slang. There were certain terms that were (in some cases: still are) reasonably well known in East Germany but virtually unknown in West Germany. ""Datsche"", for example, indicates a weekend home, being taken from Russian ""Дача"" (in English, the term 'dacha' exists as an equivalent, though I believe it is usually only used in appropriate Russian/Slavic-specific contexts). West Germans would generally say ""Wochenendhaus"".

But even most of these specific terms have now fallen out of use, as they were either specifically political (""Bausoldat"": literally 'construction soldier', unarmed conscript in the NVA; ""rübermachen"": literally 'to make across', illegally escaping the country and going to West Germany; ""Tschekist"": from the Russian cheka, official designation of a member of the Stasi) or referred to technology that was current during GDR times but is now hopeless outdated (""T34-Sport"": 'T34 Sport' (inspired by the Soviet WW2-era T34 tank), common designation for the Saporoshez personal vehicle; ""Polylux"": generic word for an overhead projector, taken from the state-owned company that made most of East Germany's overhead projectors; ""Indianerfahrrad"": literally '[American] Indian bicycle', a type of Jawa motorcycle).

Today, German speakers would have difficulty to accurately differentiate between West and East Germans by vocabulary and speech patterns alone – apart from regional accents, of course. But these already existed before the GDR."

AskHistorians,"I'm Dr James C. Ford, here to talk about my book ""Atheism at the Agora"" and the history of atheism in the ancient Greek world. AMA!","Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA.

I was wondering about a few interrelated things that concern the lack of theology and philosophy of religion in ancient Greece. The philosophers of the Agora rarely engaged with polytheism and have introduced apersonal, abstract notions of God, such as the Platonic Demiourgos and Aristotle's First Mover, for example. This seems to have nothing to do with the polytheism expressed through art and myth, and that seems a weird disconnect to me. The idea of belief in a personal, anthropomorphic God was even mocked by some, I think it was Xenophanes and some of the Sophists, but I would have to look that up. I cannot recall any Greek philosopher who would have discussed the nature of Zeus' divinity and the humanity of his children - or similar questions that have some analogy in Christian theology.

The contrast between philosophy and religion seems even greater when comparing ancient Greece with the rise of early Christian philosophy from Paulus to Augustinus. Here, philosophical theology takes up center space in an enormously detailed discussion that is taken much more serious than anyone on the Agora did.

I can think of two reasons why philosophy had little interest in Greek religion. First, it wasn't important to one's personal identity or one's identity as a citizen. The early Christians were a persecuted minority and their belief system contained very specific norms and prescriptions for everyday life, on the basis of which communities were established. Apparently, issues of identity took a much more central part in Christian life than they did in Greek polytheism. Maybe polytheism had a much less developed claim to normativity and did contribute much less to establishing communities?

Second, maybe Greek polytheism doesn't raise similarly interesting metaphysical issues as ancient Christianity did. Early Christians intensely debated the immortality of the soul, the nature of the trinity, freedom and predetermination, etc. - Greek polytheism seems not to touch on any of these issues, but its mythological nature maybe resonates more intuitively and artistically than conceptually. As Hans Blumenberg said, myths do not answer any questions, they rather prevent some questions to be asked in the first place. Maybe Greek polytheism was missing some kind of Paulinian letters that would transcend the narrative nature of myth into theological discourse.

I hope you can make some sense of what I just wrote. I would be interested in hearing your take on this perspective."

In the meantime, though I am, in the words of the great Kaytranada and his brother Lou, [""supremely lazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ozfyLHgaR8&t=82s), I hope the following answer will tempt you into going down the rabbit hole into into the wonderful, complex, and endlessly fascinating history that makes up the world of Chinese American restaurants. 

The history of Chinese migration to the United States is nearly as old as the American nation itself. It was only a handful of decades after the country's founding when New York City received its first documented Chinese immigrants in the 1830s (though Chinese sailors and merchants had been interacting with the country via Sino-U.S. trade since 1815) with the first known female Chinese immigrant to NYC being [Afong Moy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afong_Moy), a woman from the region now known as Guangzhou brought to the States by the brother traders [Nathaniel and Frederick Carne as part of a marketing gimmick](http://www.gutenberg-e.org/haj01/frames/fhaj04.html) to kickstart a demand for ""exotic"" oriental goods. Interactions like these in tandem with increased trade and colonial activity during this period era culminate in the appropriative *[chinoiseries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinoiserie)* aesthetic movement that would grip much of the West over the coming decades, but that's a story for another time.

Following the British victories over the Qing dynasty of China during the First Opium War (1839-1842) as well as during the intermittent lead-up to the Second Opium War (1856-1860), the United States began to receive sizable waves of primarily Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants primarily from the southern Chinese regions of Toisan and Guangdong province. These migrants famously sought employment in mining, railroad-building, and other high-demand manual labor, which would soon lead to numerous xenophobic and reactionary acts of both physical and political violence against Chinese migrants culminating in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, to date the only explicitly-targeted ""racial"" ban on immigration to the United States.

Yet the Chinese that had already managed to eke out a place for themselves in the US would carry on with their lives and subsequently continue to develop their communities, such as the Five Points enclave in lower Manhattan, New York City. The putative first documented Chinese restaurant opened in the United States, Canton, opened in San Francisco in 1849. The oldest continuously-running Chinese restaurant in New York City, the Nom Wah Tea Parlor, opened up in Manhattan in 1920.

By the 1940s, other such restaurants and takeout (or ""takeaway"" for you Commonwealth lot) places had sprung up across New York City, such as the [Republic Chinese American Restaurant](https://vintagemenumania.com/products/1940s-original-menu-republic-chinese-american-restaurant-new-york-kung-wo-low?variant=31137484210245) on Broadway or the previously seen China Palace (also on Broadway) as displayed in the [photo](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/records/images/content/hero/40shero-3.png) from the [New York Department of Records](https://www.nyc.gov/site/records/index.page) included at the beginning of this post. Though sparse at the start of the decade, the Chinese population in the city would begin to be augmented by a [small immigration quota that allowed around 105 visas](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/chinese-exclusion-act-repeal#:~:text=In%201943%2C%20Congress%20passed%20a,around%20105%20visas%20per%20year.) to Chinese nationals per year. 

So yes, it is entirely feasible that Vito Corleone's erstwhile kin could have had Chinese takeout in the 1940s. Even those [iconic white cardboard boxes you see on the table in the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efMQRfmrlA0), also known as oyster pails or Chinese takeout containers, would have been appropriate for the era - those were invented in the late 1800s.

As the geopolitical alliances of WWII and the following Cold War began to chip away at the institutional prejudices that had once defined American policy towards Chinese immigration, with the watershed moment being the passage of the [Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965) by Lyndon B. Johnson the 89th United States Congress, Chinese Restaurants in the United States would continue to open up, develop clientele, and establish footholds and communities across both New York City and the rest of the US. And that story, of course, is still ongoing.

AskHistorians,Why did Karl Marx oppose the separation of powers?,"Would it be possible for you to flesh your question out a bit more? For instance, what was it that prompted your question? As you no doubt know, Marx's writings are vast, so for the purposes of answering your question it would be helpful to know what exactly you're referring to."
AskHistorians,Is Napoleon the only person in history to have a war declared on them personally?,"No, although perhaps he is in the modern era. There's a long precedent of wars being declared on individuals in the ancient world, particularly regarding the Hellenistic kingdoms that emerged following Alexander's death. This is because the nature of these kingdoms was that the kings held a very personal sort of power. I will offer a generalisation to save time, but all the kingdoms tended to vary on the same model. In this model, the kings claimed power through martial prowess rather than a god given right as found in medieval Europe. They made individual pacts and treaties with the cities and peoples within their territory and often relied on professional mercenary armies paid from their semi-private fortunes rather than via drafted levies. As such, their power was formally completely separate from any territory. In fact, one of the earliest of the successors, Demetrius the besieger, continued to style himself as (and be recognised as) a king even when he held no territory but maintained his fleet. 

This very personal sort of power meant that when wars broke out between the successors, they were personal. Even the non successor states, such as Rome, often framed their wars against the individual kings rather than against any sort of peoples or territory. The Roman - Selucid War which effectively cemented their influence over Asia Minor began due to the personal infractions of the Seleucid King Antiochus III, and was regarded at Rome as a War against the individual king. 

While these examples are far earlier than that if Napoleon, I think many similarities can be drawn. In both cases, the threat and success of an 'empire' rested on the personal skills of the ruler, who had an intrinsic role in diplomacy, military activity and domestic affairs. I also imagine that there were many other wars that could be framed in such a way throughout the medieval and early modern periods when rulers and personal claims were often much more important to diplomacy than the concept of nations, but both periods are outside my area of expertise."

AskHistorians,Why did the Black death just go away?,"There really isn't much to say here other than ""it did not go away"". 

There were recurrences of the Black Death in most major cities in Europe and the Mediterranean every few years from 1350 well into the 17th century. Some of them, such as the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679 or the Great Plague of London from 1665-1666, prompted royalty to flee their capitals as the bodies literally piled up in hastily dug pits. Those two may have killed around half of the city populations, though a lack of complete records makes it hard to judge for sure (especially in the case of London where the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed swathes of the city). Even with that uncertainty, the proportion killed is in the same ballpark as those killed when the plague first emerged centuries earlier. 

The first big recurrence of the Black Death was from 1360-1362, and in some regions it seems to have killed 10-20% of the population. It particularly afflicted children and young adults who were too young to have been infected in the initial pandemic and had not developed the resistance to it that older survivors had, along with regions such as Milan that had escaped the worst of the Black Death the first time around. A third wave in 1369 seems to have killed around 10%. Many subsequent plague outbreaks (in time periods with much better record keeping than the Middle Ages) indicate that outbreaks killed roughly 10% every 5-15 years in many major cities. There were extremely few years from 1350 to 1700 that did not feature a major plague outbreak somewhere. I literally could not list them all, I would be listing almost every year for some 300 years. Even relatively minor outbreaks such as those in 1563, 1593, and 1625 in England still seem to have killed around 2-3% of the population of the entire country. That's not Black Death levels of mortality, but it is still a significant chunk of the population. 

Let's look at just Venice as an example. Recurrences of plague were such a problem for them that they built a dedicated plague hospital called the Lazzaretto Vecchio. They had city officials whose primary job was to monitor the city for signs of an imminent plague outbreak, such as a spike in people dying with swollen nodes on the neck and groin. They issued and requested *fedi di sanità* - a little pass that certified the bearer had not come from a city with plague and was not carrying plague (like [this one](https://i0.wp.com/www.historyworkshop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/s3_L0063000_L0063755-scaled.jpg?resize=1328%2C900&ssl=1) from 1611). Despite being at the forefront of the developing field of public health, the plague of 1575-1577 ruined them, killing around 30% of the city. The Lazzaretto Vecchio was totally overwhelmed. In 1575 the city was slow to lock down amid economic concerns - in previous outbreaks some had complained that the loss of trade and the impact of that on the movement of food was killing as many people as the disease - and paid the price of dropping their guard. A similar story led to the plague of 1630-1631 taking a similar chunk out of the city population, and Venice had it easy in that plague. In other cities, people were so afraid that they became violent. 

The Black Death did not go away. It remained a terrifying threat to cities and their populations across Europe and the Mediterranean for centuries.

AskHistorians,"The US has a habit of giving its laws convoluted names because they make nice acronyms (eg the Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, which spells out PATRIOT). When did this first start and why?","The military has been overwhelmed by acronyms, enough to the point that even as early as 1983 the first edition of the _Dictionary of Military and Technological Abbreviations and Acronyms_ ran for 496 pages in small print. There are also recent papers with titles like _Difficulties Interpreters Face with Military Acronyms from English into Arabic_ and genuine confusion in the field, like how during the recent Iraq war, the acronym AIF (for _anti-Iraqi forces_) was originally used, puzzling Australians who associated the term with the Australian Imperial Force; INS (for _insurgents_) eventually became standard.

However, the question is a little more specific about the practice of spelling things in words to an extreme degree (as opposed to ""creating a new word"" like RADAR). The technical word for this is a **backronym**. The oldest I have heard of (although an expert on ancient languages might be able to go older) is the Christian phrase

>Iēsous Christos, Theou Huios, Sōtēr

or Ichthus (fish) translating into ""Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior"".

Part of what is required for backronyms to even hold is for them to be sounded out entirely. Initialisms initially described words being simply spelled out, like _CIA_; note how people say cee-eye-ey, not seee-a. The earliest we have of sounded-out acronyms in English is from telegraph code.

Telegraph code seems to be mostly come from Walter P. Phillips, Associated Press bureau chief for Washington; it was published in 1879 as a way to shorten reports ([first page here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Code#/media/File:Phillips_Code_1879_first_page.agr.jpg)). You can see from the page that this definitely was intended as an abbreviation ""code"", abbreviating many words not normally abbreviated, like having ""adp"" for ""adopt"" and ""adn"" for ""addition"". However, two of the words persisted: SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the United States), from the first edition, and POTUS (only transformed into a single later, ""pot"" was originally used as ""President of the"").

Of course, SCOTUS and POTUS were simply forming ""new words"" (AWOL, another ""new word"", appeared around WWI). The start of backronym use seems to be much later, the word ""backronym"" itself being first coined in the 1980s, although this of course means it wasn't the first example. Given the fact a backronym can even be ""accidental"" it is hard to identify the true first. (Computer languages are an early source: Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code or BASIC was 1963.) However, as a full popular trend of the kind the question asks about it seems to be a late 1990s phenomenon, at least according to the _Acronyms, Initialisms, and Abbreviations Dictionary_, which calls it the ""chicken or egg"" question:

>Frequently, in choosing a name or slogan, new organizations, ad hoc groups, or activist movements will select a colorful acronym first -- one which they hope will spotlight their philosophy and be associated easily in the public mind with their ideas or purposes.

This is from the 5th edition published in 2001, and the dictionary asserts the tradition is from ""recent years"" (that is, in between the 4th and 5th editions). Given the prior edition was 1997, this narrows down the window where backronyms exploded.

With cultural phenomenon like language trends there really sometimes is no motivating factor whatsoever, but my suspicion here is the backronym popularity might be due to the AMBER Alert.

(add: going to say the theory is shot down, see the comments -- we have sufficient evidence of the time period being '96-'00 but no evidence of a particular reason, sorry!)

AskHistorians,"Given that Islam was known and practiced by certain native ethnic groups in West Africa, would it have been likely to find traces of Islamic culture or Arabic writing within enslaved communities in the United States?","The cultural genocide of enslaved Africans in the US was pretty complete, but yes, there are attested instances of Islamic prayer and practice among enslaved people.  Some traces of Islam survived among the Geechee-Gullah people of the Sea Islands, off the coast of Georgia, who were able to preserve their culture somewhat more than people on the mainland by virtue of being somewhat less split up.

Between 1936 and 1939 members of the Federal Writers Project interviewed the descendants of one Belali Mohomet (probably a corruption of the name Bilal Muhammad) on Sapelo Island, off the coast of Georgia.  The great grandchildren of Belali described him and his wife doing their best to keep to Muslim prayer times (*salat*), and making ""sadaka cakes"" to give to all as charity on certain holidays.  (""Sadaka"" being ~~probably a corruption of ""~~*~~zakat~~*~~"" - charity~~ EDIT a variant of an Arabic word for charity*.*  Many thanks to the people below who corrected me.  I should have checked Elia's article again before posting and just assuming the word.  FWIW, the mistake was mine, not hers.)

Books would have been precious and expensive, and it seems unlikely that even if survivors of the Middle Passage were literate (not likely given the social status of enslaved people) they would have had the ability to make Arabic manuscripts (not to mention the risk involved since literacy in any language was illegal for most enslaved people and could be punished). But snatches of Arabic and methods of prayer and charity and fasting did survive in somewhat tattered form among the devout, the brave, and the stubborn.

As a side note, fictionalized versions of Belali Mohomet (based on the Federal Writers Project oral histories) appear in both Toni Morrison's novel *Song of Solomon* and Julie Dash's film *Daughters of the Dust*.  Dash includes an Arabic manuscript in her film, but I'm not sure of her sources, or whether she was just trying to visually signify that the character is a Muslim and used some poetic license.

It's supposed to have originated in Helena, Texas, in the late 19th century. Helena, now a ghost town, was once prosperous but plagued by outlaws and had the ""reputation of a tough town"". A guide published in 1940 by the [Texas State Highway Commission](https://archive.org/details/texasguidetolone00writrich/page/654/mode/2up?q=knife) describes it as follows:


>Among the outlaws of this area is said to have originated that sanguinary form of personal encounter called the Helena Duel. It consisted of tying the left hands of the duelists securely together with rawhide, giving each a knife with a three-inch blade, whirling them around rapidly a few times and turning them loose. The shortness of the knife blades prohibited the likelihood of a fatal single stroke, and the fight progressed as a gruesome, gory slashing match while the contestants hacked away furiously. No quarter was given or expected.

The origin of the story (see Baker, 1975) seems to be *Pioneer Life in Texas* (1930), the autobiography of Max Krueger, a German-born rancher and industrialist, who wrote of his early days in Texas. There may be other sources, but Krueger's version seems to be the one used in [popular fiction](https://archive.org/details/silverriverranch0000scot/page/n9/mode/2up?q=%22helena+duel%22) to describe it.

AskHistorians,What was the extent of Helmut Kentler’s “giving foster children to literal pedophiles” experiment from the 60s-90s?,"As disappointing as it is, the number of children involved is still unknown. This is due to several factors, the largest of which is just that they covered their tracks pretty well. Although it was known or suspected in certain circles, it didn't really come to light until 2015 ([source](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/26/the-german-experiment-that-placed-foster-children-with-pedophiles)). Even after that, it wasn't widely known, and it took until 2021 for the German government to sponsor an investigation into it ([source](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/en/national-investigation-into-programme-that-paired-youth-with-pedophiles-li.157582)). They stated

>The Kentler case is not yet closed. Due to suspicions about a network and nationwide scope, further reappraisal and research are necessary. That is why I have commissioned a third research project at the University of Hildesheim with the task of investigating possible nationwide links

\--Sandra Scheeres (SPD)

A large part of the reason why it's so hard to find exact numbers and records is because Kentler & co. were very careful in covering their tracks. While we know that it happened, and we know their general goals, the exact adoption and foster records are hidden or missing. Despite their own beliefs, they were *very* aware of the prevalent social views on their experiment, and as such, kept it mostly buried. There's a reason he didn't publicly mention it until the statute of limitations had passed.

There's also just issues of anonymity. Even as more of it is brought to light, they want to keep the identities of victims secret in order to give them all possible privacy.

As to why Kentler was allowed to get away with it, that answer is a little more tricky.

For one, he was extremely famous and well regarded.

>Kentler was a well-known scholar, the author of several books on sex education and parenting, and he was often quoted in Germany’s leading newspapers and on its TV programs. The newspaper Die Zeit had described him as the “nation’s chief authority on questions of sexual education.”

So, he was a trusted figure who *supposedly* knew a lot about this topic. Although looking back with our modern perspective, we can clearly see how categorically evil this was, it's easy to forget that we have the benefit of several decades of cultural progress and knowledge. Pedophilia wasn't fully understood yet, and was far more acceptable.

In 1959, around when this experiment started, Hawaii's age of consent was 14. Georgia's age of consent was 14 until 1995 (when it was increased to 16). Hell, even in the 2000s, there were cases of loopholes in laws that would cause underage girls to be forced into marrying their rapist, or being denied the opportunity to divorce an abusive older husband ([source](https://www.unchainedatlast.org/united-states-child-marriage-problem-study-findings-april-2021/)). Gabriel Matzneff wrote openly about his pedophilia, and was friends with a number of important French government officials, journalists, and businessmen. He wasn't arrested until 2020 ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/europe/gabriel-matzneff-pedophilia-france.html)).

There's also the fact that West Germany was desperate. As their government was forming, WWII had left over a million children orphaned and homeless ([source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43965116#metadata_info_tab_contents)). This problem persisted into the 1960s. They barely had the capability to manage basic government tasks, they didn't have the capacity to build a comprehensive care network for the children. This is also part of the reason why finding records is hard: Kentler took advantage of the chaotic state, where records were often poorly kept or nonexistent.

The sad fact is, he was powerful and famous, with a number of important friends in the government. Same story that repeats across history: people with money and power tend to do a lot of horrifying shit. People in the government went along with him because they were close to him, or because they genuinely believed this ""expert"" was right, or just because they wanted a problem solved and didn't particularly care how it happened, so long as their hands were ""clean"". There are instances of people looking into it and trying to help the children... which were crushed by Kentler and his reputation.

**Edit:**

Going a little more in depth of Kentler's actual motivation, because I realized I never addressed it. I should stress that the second half of this is psychological analysis, which can be dangerous in history. However, in this case, he died relatively recently (in 2008), we have a number of his writings available, and he spent a great deal of time around other psychologists who have since been able to profile him. He also fits the stereotypical psychological profile almost perfectly Because of this, we can draw *some* conclusions, very cautiously.

In response to the semi-question in your post: Yes, Kentler privately admitted to a friend that he'd sexually molested his own son, and there have been a number of other credible allegations of child abuse. He believed that sex between parents and children was normal, and that it should be encouraged, as should sex between adults and children, so long as it was mutually pleasurable. Similar to how many parents encourage their children to try drinking for the first time in the home, so that they can get used to it, Kentler argued that this would actually *prevent* abuse by teaching children what a pleasurable and consensual relationship looked like.

**THIS IS OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY WRONG AND HORRIFICALLY IMMORAL.**

The most simple analysis is that Kentler had a desire to sexually molest children. He desperately needed that to be normal, to be right, because otherwise, he'd have to accept that there was something fundamentally wrong with him. It also fits with the actions of someone who has been abused by a parent: he couldn't make the image of a  loving father and child molestor fit, so he decided that it *must* be normal in order to avoid confronting that what had happened to him was wrong.

---

Also, upon looking into it more, it wasn't *quite* as well hidden as I thought. 2015 was when the broad public became aware, but he'd mentioned it in his book in 1989. A feminist newspaper called [Emma](https://www.emma.de/fmt-persons/kentler-helmut) had reported on it, leading him to be shouted down by a group of women when receiving an award, and punched in the face at a later time.  [It also cost him an award](https://www.haz.de/lokales/hannover/der-professor-und-die-kleinen-jungs-JDIRQKITE6F7RNR7ZH6SGKPIQQ.html). However, as mentioned previously, it didn't really reach the public awareness until later. Part of that was likely due to the fact that his book wasn't really read outside of academic circles, many of whom were predisposed to agree with him. Those who challenged him were shown his ""evidence"" that the program had worked (spoiler alert: the evidence has been routinely and thoroughly debunked).

A large part of why it took so long for the government to act was that there are a large number of people still in power who were involved (or who are connected to someone involved, or owe their career to one, you get the idea). On top of that, no politician ever wants to admit ""Yeah, our government deliberately allowed pedophilia""."
AskHistorians,Why don’t we eat mutton in the US?,"I'll take a stab at this, though I'm not sure how comprehensive I can be.

\---

Part I of the answer is: **we used to eat a lot more sheep.**

**Historical Data**

The USDA has a pretty good repository of historical data about US livestock practices through history. Records from before the mid 1800's are basically nonexistent (unsurprisingly), but we have numbers from enough of recent history to draw some reasonable conclusions.

Here's an older USDA report on the health of the US sheep industry:

[https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41867/50712\_ages9048.pdf](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41867/50712_ages9048.pdf)

Around PDF page 9, you can see a graph of historical sheep inventory. The US sheep inventory peaked around 51 million head in 1884, and came close to that number (49 million) in 1942.

Compare this to graphs of the historical inventories of beef cattle:

[https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts\_and\_Maps/Cattle/inv.php](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Cattle/inv.php)

The rail expansion westward in the 19th century had opened up the midwest, which has vast swaths of grazing land; if you want to raise a bunch of animals that require a bunch of grazing land, it was now possible to do so and move your product around. The emergence and development of the beef industry is itself a topic that would take an entire post to cover - suffice it to say, it was a new and growing industry.

You can see that around the same time as the peak of the sheep industry, the beef industry had about the same number of heads of cattle. Granted, a head of beef is substantially more meat than a head of sheep, but the point remains that at one time, the US sheep industry was **much** larger than it is today.

So what changed?

**Industrialization**

The type of industrial farming we see today is a relatively modern invention, emerging in the US in the 1950's with the first CAFOs being piloted by poultry farmers. A bit of this history is dicussed in a paper about the expansion of the swine industry in the US:

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05789-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05789-5)

In essence, competing livestock industries developed different techniques to increase production and, therefore, profits. 

Of course, *demand* for meat was also increasing at this time - the reasons for that could probably be the subject of many posts of its own, but suffice it to say that Americans wanted to eat more meat, and so livestock industries responded by trying to increase production.

**Why Sheep Got the Shaft**

The very first paper I linked mentions some of the specific challenges regarding sheep - namely, that beef cattle occupy the same land and resources (but of course require much more of both) as sheep, and with plentiful land in the midwest, the beef industry was able to expand. While beef cattle are more resource-intensive to farm than sheep, they're more profitable (if grazing land is plentiful, you can grow a much larger animal for about the same amount of human input), easier to fit into the CAFO model, and easier to protect from predators.

The sheep inventory declined rapidly as a burgeoning beef industry out-competed it for the same resources and the same market, essentially. Americans started eating more meat, and the beef industry's access to land enabled it to supply meat in greater quantity faster than the sheep industry could. Market forces lead to contraction of the sheep inventory.

All cattle industries go through cycles - the beef industry still hasn't repeated its peak of the 1970's - but given the intense resource requirements of beef, it's unlikely that the sheep inventory could replace it.

\---  
Part II of the answer is: **you might actually be eating mutton in the US and not know it.**

Here's an article from the actual US sheep industry outlining some of the realities:

[https://www.sheepusa.org/blog/newsmedia-sheepindustrynews-pastissues-2018-january2018-defininglamb](https://www.sheepusa.org/blog/newsmedia-sheepindustrynews-pastissues-2018-january2018-defininglamb)

USDA labeling laws draw a distinction between ""lamb,"" ""yearling,"" and ""mutton,"" but the ovine industry in the US doesn't fully agree with the USDA's definitions. 

In addition, the USDA doesn't really have a specific definition of ""lamb"" or ""mutton"" - or rather, the only federal definition of ovine meat in the US is ""lamb,"" and its definition is ""the meat of sheep,"" so it can legally be applied to sheep meat of any age in the US:

[https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-65/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRacc250d654927e0/section-65.190](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-65/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFRacc250d654927e0/section-65.190)

That leaves it up to individual farmers to decide whether what you're buying is ""lamb"" or ""mutton,"" and it turns out the differences aren't always that clear-cut - so sometimes, you buy ""lamb"" in the US that is actually more akin to ""mutton,"" and you wouldn't know the difference because the labeling practices here are not at all standardized for this industry. USDA quality grading is voluntary, and less than 50% of the sheep industry participates, so there's really nobody looking at the sheep saying ""this is lamb and this is mutton.""

Contrast this with, say, British labeling laws for ""lamb"" and ""mutton;"" there, ""lamb"" is specifically an ovine animal less than 12 months old or with no permanent incisors. New Zealand has expanded slightly to allow the first incisor, but is otherwise the same. Both further define ""hogget"" (a sheep between 1 and 2 years old) and ""mutton"" (a fixed sheep >2 years old) in very specific terms.

So...people buying ""lamb"" in the US may well be buying mutton or something closer to mutton without knowing it, whereas other countries spell out their labeling requirements for ovine meat more explicitly. 

\---

So in summary: the sheep industry used to be a lot larger, but growing demand for meat in the US saw the beef industry crowd it out.

Furthermore, there is no standard definition of ""mutton"" in the US, and the broad definition of ""lamb"" here means that some things you buy labelled as ""lamb"" may actually be mutton.

I think there is a broader question of US culture - why do we shy away from lamb even when it's available - and that's certainly a compelling topic. I think, ultimately, it's a product of market evolution, and an industry rising to meat a specific demand."

# ""ABOVE THE SENIOR WRANGLER""

\-----------------

To be a woman in the Victorian age was to be weak: the connection was that definite. To be female was also to be fragile, dependent, prone to nerves and—not least—possessed of a mind that was several degrees inferior to a man’s. For much of the 19th century, women were not expected to shine either academically or athletically, and those who attempted to do so were cautioned that they were taking an appalling risk. Mainstream medicine was clear on this point: to dream of studying at the university level was to chance madness or sterility, or both.

It took generations to transform this received opinion; that, a long series of scientific studies, and the determination and hard work of many thousands of women. For all that, though, it is still possible to point to one single achievement, and one single day, and say: this is when everything began to change. That day was June 7, 1890, when—for the first and only time—a woman ranked first in the mathematical examinations held at the University of Cambridge. It was the day that Philippa Fawcett placed “above the Senior Wrangler.”

To understand why one woman’s achievement so shook the prejudices of the Victorian age—and why newspapers from the *New York Times* to the *Times of India* thought it worthwhile to devote thousands of words to an exam that today means little to anybody but the students themselves—it is necessary to understand why Cambridge mathematics mattered in the 19th century. To begin with, the university was arguably the finest seat of learning in what was then the greatest empire in the world. More than that, though, the Cambridge math course was generally regarded as the toughest academic challenge available to that empire’s finest minds. To be Cambridge’s champion mathematician—its “Senior Wrangler,” in the university’s ancient slang—was to attain the greatest intellectual distinction available to a quarter of the population of the globe. It practically guaranteed a stellar academic career; no fewer than nine Senior Wranglers became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a position held by both Sir Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking.

Thus Fawcett’s triumph was astonishing—all the more so when it is realized that Cambridge, like most of the other great universities of the day, including Oxford, Harvard and Yale, did not admit women or permit them to take degrees. Separate colleges had been established for women only in the 1870s, and they gradually became loosely affiliated with universities. By the 1890s things had advanced to the point where the women at those colleges—Cambridge had two, Newnham and Girton—were allowed to take the same exams as males. But they were marked and ranked separately, with the women’s results read after the men’s at an annual ceremony held at the university Senate House. Math students, uniquely, were ranked in numerical order, from first to last, rather than in broad bands of ability, so it was possible to compare one student directly with another. Men taking “first class” degrees in math—equivalent to the American *summa cum laud*e–became Wranglers; those placed below them in the second class–*magna cum laude*–were Optimes. If a woman scored a mark, say, higher than the 21st Optime but lower than the 20th, she would be announced as “between the 20th and 21st Optimes.”

The idea that a female candidate could score highly enough to be ranked among the Wranglers was still fairly startling in 1890. To considerable surprise, the earliest tests, dating to the 1860s, had suggested that men and women scored roughly equally in every other subject. But math remained inviolate; male mathematicians still did incontestably better. So when a Girton student named Agnata Ramsay topped the rankings in the Classics exams in 1887—she was the only candidate, male or female, awarded a first-class degree in the subject that year—the 21-year-old’s reward amounted to nothing more than an admiring cartoon in *Punch* (a humorous British weekly scarcely known for its support for women’s rights) and a proposal of marriage from H.M. Butler, the brilliant but 55-year-old Master of Trinity, Cambridge’s largest and wealthiest college (which Ramsay accepted).

Ramsay’s triumph, remarkable though it was, only reinforced the status of math as the last bastion of male academic supremacy. There, at least, female bodies and female brains still fell short of men’s. Indeed, most Victorian scholars believed a woman was simply incapable of demonstrating the unwavering logic required to master math, since women were at base creatures of emotion.

Today, the science that underpinned those views seems crackpot. To the Victorians, it was breakthrough stuff. Central to the 19th-century concept of human development was the idea that the adolescent body was a closed system; there was only so much energy available, and so a body in which resources were diverted to mental development was one in which physical development necessarily suffered. This was thought to be a particular problem for women, because their reproductive system was far more complicated than men’s and so consumed a greater proportion of the body’s resources. A young woman who studied hard during puberty was believed to be taking special risks since “the brain and ovary could not develop at the same time,” as  Judith Walzer Leavitt points out. Equally popular was the belief, based on crude measurements of skull volume, that women were doomed to remain childlike in important ways—”weak-willed, impulsive \[and\] markedly imitative rather than original, timid and dependent,” as Cynthia Eagle Russett puts it—because their brains were smaller than mens’."

Ta'c méeywi (Good morning), everyone. Welcome to another installment of Monday Methods. Today, I will be touching on an issue that might [seem familiar to some of you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57w1hh/monday_methods_holocaust_denial_and_how_to_combat/) and that might be a new subject for some others. As mentioned in the title, that subject is the [American Indian (Native American) Genocide(s) and how to combat the denial of these genocides.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/wiki/faq/genocide) This is part one of a two part series.

Therefore, as part of our efforts to continue upholding the veracity of history, this includes helping everyone to understand this predominately controversial subject. Now, let's get into it...

# State of Denial

In the United States, an ostensibly subtle state of denial exists regarding portions of this country's history. One of the biggest issues concerning the colonization of the Americas is whether or not genocide was committed by the incoming colonists from Europe and their American counterparts. We will not be discussing today whether this is true or not, but for the sake of this discussion, [it is substantially true.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5b0xzk/i_am_in_a_class_with_a_student_who_is_adamant/d9kyj0l/) Many people today, typically those who are descendants of settlers and identify with said ancestors, vehemently deny the case of genocide for a variety of reasons. David Stannard (1992) explains this by saying:

>Denial of massive death counts is common—and even readily understandable, if contemptible—among those whose forefathers were perpetrators of the genocide. Such denials have at least two motives: first, protection of the moral reputations of those people and that country responsible for genocidal activity . . . and second, on occasion, the desire to continue carrying out virulent racist assaults upon those who were the victims of the genocide in question (p. 152).

These reasons are predicated upon numerous claims, but all that point back to an ethnocentric worldview that actively works to undermine even the possibility of other perspectives, particularly minority perspectives. When ethnocentrism is allowed to proliferate to this point, it is no longer benign in its activity, for it develops a greed within the host group that results in what we have seen time and again in the world—subjugation, total war, slavery, theft, racism, and genocide. More succinctly, we can call this manifestation of ethnocentric rapaciousness the very essence of colonialism. More definitively, this term colonialism “refers to both the formal and informal methods (behaviors, ideologies, institutions, policies, and economies) that maintain the subjugation or exploitation of Indigenous Peoples, lands, and resources” (Wilson & Yellow Bird, 2005, p. 2).

# Combating American Indian Genocide Denial

Part of combating the atmosphere of denialism about the colonization of the Americas and the resulting genocide is understanding that denialism does exist and then being familiar enough with the tactics of those who would deny such genocide. Churchill (1997), Dunbar-Ortiz (2014), and Stannard (1992) specifically work to counter the narrative of denialism in their books, exposing the reality that on many accounts, the “settler colonialism” that the European Nations and the Americans engaged in “is inherently genocidal” (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014, p. 9).

To understand the tactics of denialism, we must know how this denialism developed. Two main approaches are utilized to craft the false narrative presented in the history text books of the American education system. **First,** the education system is, either consciously or subconsciously, manipulated to paint the wrong picture or even used against American Indians. Deloria and Wildcat (2001) explain that:

>Indian education is conceived to be a temporary expedient for the purpose of bringing Indians out of their primitive state to the higher levels of civilization . . . A review of Indian education programs of the past three decades will demonstrate that they have been based upon very bad expectations (pp. 79-80).

“With the goal of stripping Native peoples of their cultures, schooling has been the primary strategy for colonizing Native Americans, and teachers have been key players in this process” (Lundberg & Lowe, 2016, p. 4). Lindsay (2012) notes that the California State Department of Education denies genocide being committed and sponsored by the state (Trafzer, 2013). Textbooks utilized by the public education system in certain states have a history of greatly downplaying any mention of the atrocities committed, if they're mentioned at all (DelFattore, 1992, p. 155; Loewen, 2007).

The **second** approach occurs with the actual research collected. Anthropologists, scholarly experts who often set their sights on studying American Indians, have largely contributed to the misrepresentation of American Indians that has expanded into wider society (Churchill, 1997; Deloria, 1969; Raheja, 2014). Deloria (1969) discusses the damage that many anthropological studies have caused, relating that their observations are published and used as the lens with which to view American Indians, suggesting a less dynamic, static, and unrealistic picture. “The implications of the anthropologist, if not all America, should be clear for the Indian. Compilation of useless knowledge “for knowledge’s sake” should be utterly rejected by Indian people” (p. 94). Raheja (2014) reaffirms this by discussing the same point, mentioning Deloria’s sentiments:

>Deloria in particular has questioned the motives of anthropologists who conduct fieldwork in Native American communities and produce “essentially self-confirming, self-referential, and self-reproducing closed systems of arcane ‘pure knowledge’—systems with little, if any, empirical relationship to, or practical value for, real Indian people (p. 1169).

To combat denial, we need to critically examine the type of information and knowledge we are exposed to and take in. This includes understanding [that more than one perspective exists on any given subject, field, narrative, period, theory, or ""fact,""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Monday+Methods%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) as all the previous Monday Methods demonstrate. To effectively combat this denialism, and any form of denialism, diversifying and expanding our worldviews can help us to triangulate overlapping areas that help to reveal the bigger picture and provide us with what we can perceive as truthful.

## Methods of Denialism

A number of scholars and those of the public will point out various other reasons as to the death and atrocities that occurred regarding the Indians in the Americas. Rather than viewing the slaughter for what it is, they paint it as a tragedy; an unfortunate, but inevitable end. This attitude produces denial of the genocides that occurred with various scapegoats being implemented (Bastien et al., 1999; Cameron, Kelton, & Swedlund, 2015; Churchill, 1997).

Part 2 of the original Part 1 follows:"
AskHistorians,"Jules Verne discussed the possibility that hunting will drive some animals to extinction, and yet, he seems completely okay with it. Did most people think this way back then?","I'm a little concerned about speculating too much here as I'm genuinely not that versed in Jules Verne's writing or the literary movements/thinking of his era, and worry about reading too much into it, but I can talk about contemporary conservation and thinking on extinction. Perhaps as a tag-team with u/mazamundi or others we can arrive at a more complete answer to the question. I'd be curious what the full text of the specific passage is, who the trappers are supposed to be and what the animals they were talking about were!   


I wrote a bit about the origins of wildlife conservation and preservation of specific wildlife species [here (When did people start trying to preserve endangered species from extinction and how did the practice start?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o79qjv/comment/h3paac8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and there's a bit more discussion about early modern ideas of environmental impact [here (when did people start to think introducing non-native species into another environment was bad?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11zisal/when_did_people_start_to_think_introducing/). The key theme here is that we see concern and conservationist sentiments emerge with figures like Alexander von Humboldt in the final days of the 18th century and grow among professionals, scientists, and philosophers through Verne's time and into the 20th century - but part and parcel of their sentiment is that it's not widely enough shared by their peers who are still out their shooting every duck they can find and generally despoiling the Earth! Indeed, this sense that short-sighted and rapacious stewardship of our natural resources is perhaps a problem continues through the works of the likes of Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson (and if it sounds suspiciously similar to things folks have said in the 21st century... well, at least we're in venerable company). 

So the idea that trappers, hunters, or sportsman might seem unconcerned about the possibility of game animals going extinct is relatively plausible to me - but the weird thing here is that the countervailing pressure conservationists were pushing back on was not that we *ought* to be driving animals extinct, it was that the natural resources of Earth and/or God's domain were literally or functionally inexhaustible and we need not concern ourselves with petty things like, in classic Oregon Trail fashion, shooting literally every animal you see. Hunters and trappers, of course, hunt and trap game for a living. This becomes a tricky proposition if you're actively crusading to eliminate the animals from which you derive your paycheck. I have never read anyone talking about sportsman seeming positive about the possibility of game animals disappearing.

If that's right, where might Verne have gotten the idea expressed in this question? Well first, note that I mentioned *game* animals - these same folks had a lot of judgements and few misgivings about killing the heck out of second rate, less desirable animals - especially predators. Though raptors, wolves, lions and bears are all seen as cool and charismatic animals now, the popular sentiment in the early modern period was that such creatures were not just dangerous or harmful but morally suspect characters which ought to be eliminated. Ironically, within a decade of the founding of the Bureau of Biological Survey (which would become the US Fish and Wildlife Service), it adopted into it's mission not just survey and study of fish and wildlife, but the eradication of such pest animals from the mix. I like the wikipedia section on this quite a bit so I'm just going to quote a [relevant paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service#Mission):

> This garnered them the support of ranchers and western legislators resulting, by 1914, in a $125,000 congressionally approved budget for use ""on the National Forests and the public domain in destroying wolves, coyotes and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry"". Meawhile, scientists like Joseph Grinnell and Charles C. Adams, a founder of the Ecological Society of America, were promoting a ""balance of nature"" theory - the idea that predators were an important part of the larger ecosystem and should not be eradicated. In 1924, at a conference organized by the American Society of Mammologists (ASM), the debate generated a public split between those in the Survey, promoting eradication, and those from the ASM who promoted some sort of accommodation. Edward A. Goldman, from the Survey, made perfectly clear their position in a paper that with the arrival of Europeans in North America, the balance of nature had been ""violently overturned, never to be reestablished"". He concludes with the idea that ""Large predatory mammals, destructive to livestock and to game, no longer have a place in our advancing civilization."" The Survey subsequently placed over 2 million poisoned bait stations across the west and by 1930 had ""extirpated wolves from the Lower 48 and advised and assisted in erasing grey wolves from"" Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. The Survey then turned to the eradication of coyote, coordinated through the 1931 Animal Damage Control Act.

[Sidenote: eradicating coyotes turns out to be super hard and ill conceived, and you can read much, much more about this whole saga in the book Coyote America: A Natural and Supernatural History if that piques your interest]

Obviously, many thought *some* animals could rightfully be eliminated - but embedded there you can see the core of a more overarching idea: that from European arrival in the ""new world"", these settlers had a manifest destiny to destroy or tame the ""savage"" and uncivilized natural forces of this wild and ""primeval"" place, and make the Americas into a garden for (European) man's benefit. The podcast 99% Invisible did a [very nice episode](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-wilderness-tool/) which includes a section on the invention of ""Wilderness"" and discusses this sentiment. 

Political ecologist Michelle Kaika dubbed the broader early modern impulse ""Modernity's Promethean project"" which sought to use new technologies, science, and industry to both separate human life from nature, and to master and make useful previously dangerous and unpredictable natural forces. The idea that we ought to ""tame"" nature has deeper roots in European philosophy and history though - versions of it are present in classical treatises on land management and personal virtue, but it's especially strong in European christian thought, which (to paint with a broad brush) interpreted ""wilderness"" to be a degenerated form of the garden of Eden, to be made more pure through cultivation and the mastery of human hands. 

So with all of *that* context established, we get to the speculation: was Jules Verne channeling a real sentiment among frontier people, or might he be expressing a broader, more urbane (possibly scientific romantic?) cultural ideal through the eyes of his protagonists: that one day the frontier might be civilized, the wild creatures eliminated and the land put to more ""virtuous"" purposes of a pastoral ideal? The latter seems pretty plausible to me."
AskHistorians,If you went back in time to a year labeled as “B.C.” and asked someone from that time what year it was what would they have said?,This question might get a more detailed response if you ask about a specific time and place. I know the Romans would have used the mythical founding of the city as their year 0. I'm curious if this was common practice during the time. Would Greek City states have each had their own calendar dated to their respective city's founding? Was there a common calendar between nearby cities or across an even wider area?
AskHistorians,"European captials have, almost without exemption, access to water. Many are situated near the sea, or ar build around great rivers such as the Danube. Then there's Madrid. Is there any explanation for this?","Until the reign of Charles V, there was no such thing as a capital. In other words, the capital was where the king was, and the monarchs were very much itinerant. This one can see just by reading the datum of documents produced by the Royal Court, like documents emanating from the General Registry of the Cort's Seal or the Chamber of Castile. King Philip II, among the first things he did, was to decided that the Royal Court should be in a fixed place, not only for his own commodity, but also for the convenience of the functionaries who would not need to be constantly travelling. As for where should he settle, he had a number of options.  
  
Seville was the most populous and richest city, but it was too far away from other important places like Barcelona, Valencia, or the northern ports.  
  
Toledo was a very centric city, and very rich. The main problem was that it was under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Toledo, so having the court not in a place of royal jurisdiction would be a big no. A King having no authority over the city where he resided would have been completely unseemly, as the Crown's authority could be hindered by the archbishop of Toledo  
  
Valladolid would be far from Seville, Valencia, and Barcelona. It had the advantage of being of royal jurisdiction, but the disadvantages outweighed the advantages.  
  
Madrid was very centric so the information from the limits of the country would be received relatively soon from any given point, it was a place under royal jurisdiction, had a very good supply of water, and there were top-notch hunting places in close proximity, something the king loved. The fact that it was a rather small place (12,000 people) played in Madrid's favour, as there were not any really strong local powers, so the king's authority would not be hindered by nobiliary disputes. Thus, the rank of capital city was bestowed or maybe thrust upon Madrid.

As I mentioned, Madrid's supply was very good, and it was perfectly adequate for a town with a population of about 12,000 individuals. However, with the town becoming capital of the kingdoms of the Spains comes population growth, in this case an absolute population explosion.

Madrid not only had a river, small as it might be compared to the great rivers like Duero, Tajo, Ebro, or the mighty Guadalquivir, but it also had some streams, like the Abroñigal, and a network of qanats dating from the Umayyad period that could guarantee the supply of water. 

The population kept growing, to the point that the water supply became compromised, so in 1608 the Board of Waters of Madrid (Junta de Aguas de Madrid) was created as an independent organism that would be in charge of guaranteeing Madrid's supply of the element of life. And the Board delivered.

Five ""viajes de agua"" (water canalisations from streams and aquifers) were created: Buen Suceso, finished in 1618; Amaniel, completed in 1621; Fuente Castellana, in 1620; Abroñigal Alto, and Abroñigal Bajo, in 1630 both. As the city kept growing, more viajes were built: Contreras, done in 1645; Alcubilla, 1692.

So, lacking an impressive river, the city and the Crown had to make do with what there was available in terms of rivers, streams, and underground aquifers in order to have a strong water availability in the town."
AskHistorians,How were nations able to increase the literacy rate in the early 20th century so effectively?,"A whole lot of legwork in the 18th and 19th century. While there were a number of factors, generally speaking, there were two essential ideas that contributed to increased literary rates: universal/compulsory education and the feminization of the profession. To be sure, the history looks different in every country and society and there will always exceptions to the rules, but in big swoops, we can look at those two ideas to understand education at the dawn of the 20th century. 

#**Education as a Public Good AKA Universal/Compulsory Education** 

First is the idea of education as a public good. This idea had two parts: the government should provide schools for children and parents should send their children. These two ideas, which can be thought of the paired goals of *universal* education (a seat for every child) and *compulsory* education (laws against truancy, parents must send their child to school) emerged in different countries at different times and required the establishment of a bureaucracy. Governments needed systems to pool money collected via taxes and distribute it to systems of education. They needed to take attendance and confirm children were at school and by the 1850s or so, there were a few successful models. The most well-known model was created in Prussia and as policy makers and politicians in different countries warmed to the idea of government-funded education, they often traveled to the country to see their system first hand. A bunch of those visitors said something to the effect of, ""this is great! We'll try this!"" Some said, ""this bit is great, this bit would never work where I'm from, and this bit is silly"" and others said, ""yeah... no. We'll stick with our structure."" It's important to stress that their visits were generally focused on the ""how"" of public education, less than the why.

The ""why"" question was asked and mostly answered in the 18th century as government leaders like Thomas Jefferson and ~~Frederick II~~ Friedrich Wilhelm I [thanks u/Helpful-Ad8537 for the catch] (more on Prussia's why [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yju8rr/what_was_the_original_purpose_of_the_prussian/)) worked to convince their countrymen that using government funds to education the children of their country was a net good for the country; mass education could help ensure better citizens. (Not everyone agreed. See: child labor.) 

Which leads us back to the idea of universal education. The notion of who counts as a citizen was a close companion of which children those in positions of power in any given country or society felt were entitled to an education. While in most European countries and colonies, girls were given some form of education, over the course of 19th century, educational programs for boys and girls evened out (with girls learning more of the things boys learned as opposed to the other way.) While some differences remain and girls and women were often not considered citizens in the same way boys and men were, white non-disabled girls were shifted into the group of children, which already included white, non-disabled boys, who those in power felt were entitled to government-funded education. 

That said, non-disabled children from historically marginalized groups - of all genders - in European countries and colonies often found their inclusion in the schoolhouse dependent on the whims of those in power. In addition, there were laws, most notably in the Southern American states that explicitly prohibited enslaved children and adults from learning to read. While the results of the Civil War ended those laws, southern states grudgingly gave Black children access to education. In many cases, they dragged their feet on compulsory education laws as a way to avoided provided tax dollars to Black schools. (As a quick aside, when it looked like *Brown v. Board* was going to go in the parents' favor, Mississippi rolled back its compulsory education laws as a way to avoid integrating schools. If parents weren't legally required to send their children, states could wave away any obligations related to universal education.) 

To close this loop by following up on my use of ""non-disabled"" above. It wasn't until the modern era that disabled children of all races and genders have been included in the idea of which children are entitled to a government-funded education aka an explicit acknowledgment of their role as future voters. A lot of that history is related to disability activism, shifting norms about the visibility of disabled children in society, and advances in health care. 

So, that's the first concept: over the course of the 19th century, it became widely accepted that a country would be better of if the government played an active role in the education of the children growing up in the country. Broadly speaking.

#**The Feminization of the Profession**

The second idea gets at your last question, ""how where there enough teachers?"" and can be best thought of as a straight-up PR campaign. In the mid-1800s, those interested in universal education recognized what you did: if you're going to send every kid to school, you need teachers. (The idea teachers should be trained before becoming a teacher is likely Prussia's most enduring contribution to the history of public education.) Teachers, though, at that time were not exactly committed to the work of educating nations' future voters. In most countries before this point, most educators taught the sons of men with access to power using corporal punishment as a primary instructional tool and didn't especially like their jobs. In many cases, teachers were young men who took the job in-between others jobs or while saving up money to travel. There was, though, an entire cohort of young people who were sitting at home who were, the advocates thought, ideally positioned for creating the new profession needed for a new approach to formal education.

Beginning with advocacy work in the 1820s, public school advocates pushed hard to convince young, unmarried white women that they were born to be teachers. Their brothers could step behind the pulpit to serve God and their country, they could step behind the lecture. Teaching, you see, was just like mothering, the most innate thing a member of the ""gentler sex"" could do. Advocates gave speeches. They published pamphlets and traveled thousand of miles. Not only did they work to convince the young women to leave their fathers' homes, they convinced their fathers that working as a teacher was a noble act. It was ""women's true profession."" Part of this advocacy was turning gross, rundown schoolhouses into clean, safe spaces that were more like the parlor than a prison. ([More on that here if you're so inclined](https://nursingclio.org/2018/05/03/prison-cells-and-pretty-walls-gender-coding-and-american-schools/).) And they were wildly successful. Some historians have offered that, by the 1870s, upwards of 7 out of 10 white women in Massachusetts had been a teacher at one point in her life. (Teachers were expected to leave the classroom upon getting married.) 

So just like governments needed systems to collect and distribute tax dollars for education, they needed systems to shape what was taught. Concurrent to rise of that bureaucracy, was the rise of schoolmen, or school administrators. And they were the ones who were focused on efficiency; high literacy rates are the fruit of their labor. 


_____
A quick caveat about literacy rates. The history of determining literacy rates is worth it's own question, but generally speaking, we have to take such numbers before the modern era with a grain of salt. First, the denominator is often misleading. Some will claim Colonial America was among the most literate nations on earth. A true statement if you exclude all of the enslaved people and recognize that literacy was often defined as the ability to recite Biblical passages (not necessarily read) and recognize one's name. In addition, the idea that being literate means reading AND writing is a fairly new concept. It was entirely possible to be able to read and unable to write as in many cases they were taught as separate skills until the mid-1800s and even then, it took some heavy lifting from advocates to shifting common thinking about what it means to be literate."
AskHistorians,Why are German and Irish restaurants comparatively much less common than Italian and Mexican restaurants in the US even though there were large waves of immigration from all of those places?,"I don’t think it is entirely facetious to suggest that Italian and Mexican foods were simply more delicious, complex and distinctive than German and Irish ones, and that the different circumstances of these groups' migrations to the U.S. shaped the relative importance of cuisine to their identity. The historian Hasia Diner has shown that shared and distinctive culinary traditions were an important component of Italian immigrant identity in a way which was just not true for Irish and German communities. \[1\] In fact, *not* having a particularly distinctive culinary tradition was a point of pride for Irish communities, for whom the living memory of the Great Famine, a history of persecution, colonial starvation and animosity towards British imperial rule were much more important markers of migrant identity and culture. \[2\] Simple, stripped back meals involving basic ingredients were the mainstay of the Irish values of 'piety, poverty and perseverance' which were only hardened as families faced persecution and discrimination and their attempts to assimilate were shunned. \[3\] To some extent, this dynamic was also true of pre-famine Ireland, and one can hear echoes of it in the complaint of William Wilde (father of Oscar) that Irish Catholics had no culinary knowledge and ate raw, degraded and non-nutritional foodstuffs like potatoes, which marked them out as more primitive than the Protestant Ascendancy and its more sophisticated tastes for *pommes à la crème*. For Wilde, roasting and boiling potatoes didn't even count as proper 'cooking', especially not in relation to the 'modern' techniques of French gastronomy and *haute cuisine* which he was familiar with by virtue of his membership of Dublin high society. \[4\] Wilde's prejudice's aside, it seems as though Irish Catholics in turn acknowledged their simple honest food with pride, seen as more pious and proper than the dilettante excessiveness and ostentation of Protestant dinner tables, and that these sentiments, compounded by the memory and trauma of hunger and starvation, were brought with the Irish migrant community to the land of abundance. Diner also claims that Irish women did not see cooking as a place for the expression of culinary skill and domestic virtue but as a chore which many of them, who worked as domestic servants, associated literally with labour and exploitation, and the lack of Irish cooking skills was a subject of discriminatory stereotypes about Irish servant girls' propensity to steal cooked food.

Diner explains that Italians, on the other hand, created a rich food culture based on their experiences of abandoning the poverty they faced in Italy and aspiring to join the ranks of the middle class. \[1\] With access to relatively cheap meat, milk, a diversity of vegetables and flours Italians used food as a vehicle of cultural unification, creating a variety of sauces and dishes which their parents back in Italy could not even have dreamed of affording, let alone eating regularly. Many classic Italian-American dishes are versions of the food of the Italian upper class, which poor Italians would not have the chance to enjoy until after WWII. Diner shows that this aspirational food culture was very different to the Irish one, which was increasingly focused on alcohol as opposed to food as a means of recreation. Whilst the restaurant quickly became the centre of Italian cultural life in America, for the Irish community it was the pub. If eating together was not a pastime or social occasion but a means of survival, drinking together was.

As for Germans, because German protestants did not face the same kind of discrimination as Irish and Italians before WWI their experience of cultural ethnogenesis and culinary assimilation were rather different, and to a large extent German dishes were smoothly incorporated into ‘American’ cuisine just as English traditions were. To give an obvious example, the hamburger is probably the most recognisable symbol of American cuisine, but takes its name from the second-largest city in Germany, and has its origins in Hamburg’s ‘Rundstück warm’ and the various ground meat patties of Central and Northern Europe (known invariably as *Frikadeller, kjøttkaker, kotlety mielone, pannbiff*). The American ‘hot dog’ sausage, still referred to as a ‘Frankfurter’, is of course the German *Frankfurter Würstchen.* Lager, the most popular alcoholic beverage in the United States, is a German invention and modern *Lagerbier* probably originated in Bavaria. It was brought to the U.S. by German immigrants, and the Pabst, Schlitz, Miller, and Blatz breweries were some of the most recognizable brands in the country and remain popular in some form to this day (I believe Schiltz and Blatz were bought by Pabst). The Jewish community has also popularised foods associated with Germany and Central/Northern European cuisine, such as bagels, Apfelstrudel, pastrami, rye bread and pickled cucumbers. This is probably why areas of the U.S. that were heavily populated with German speakers, such as the Midwest, did not develop a separate ‘German-American’ culinary culture and one cannot find many ‘German’ restaurants there today (exceptions aside, like Milwaukee’s famous Karl Ratzsch which closed in 1993). Of course, the wartime discrimination and rapid assimilation of German-speaking Americans, many of whom adopted English names, limited use of the German language and abandoned German traditions, would likely have wiped out any such restaurants that did exist. I have not come across any examples myself, but I would not be surprised if there were examples abound of ‘Schmidt’s Restaurant’ or ‘Müller’s Diner’ becoming ‘Smith’s’ and ‘Miller’s’ during that intense period of anti-German sentiment in the U.S., and more obviously German dishes being replaced with ‘American’ ones.

AskHistorians,Did the Muslims know the First crusaders were on their way to the Holy Land before they arrived or did they just appear on the horizon one day?,"Yes, they knew the crusaders were coming. On the one hand, word of the crusade had spread far and wide and there's no way to hide an army/pilgrimage of some 100,000 people. But more importantly, there were also groups making sure that rulers in the path of the crusade were aware, including the Byzantine emperor Alexios Komnenos, Yaghi-Siyan (the governor of Antioch) and the crusaders themselves. For this diplomatic stuff our best sources is probably Raymond d'Aguilers - a priest on the crusade and chaplain to Count Raymond IV of Toulouse, who was one of its leaders. As a literate man close to the leadership, there's a high chance he handled some of the diplomatic communications for the crusade. 

Alexios Komnenos was the one to ask Europe for aid against the Seljuk Turks, which Pope Urban II used as the basis of his crusade. However, he realised rather quickly that this was not the well organised supporting army he was looking for and sent some letters to inform regional allies that the crusade was on its way. Of greatest significance is that he informed the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, which is mentioned in several contemporary sources. They, like the Byzantines, wanted to push back the Seljuks and they updated each other on the military situation. Alexios seems to have kept the Fatimids updated regularly. This prompted the Fatimids to launch their own offensive toward the Holy Land, taking Jerusalem in 1098, after which they sent and envoy to the crusading army to inform them that Jerusalem had been taken and offer an alliance against the Seljuks for a new offensive into Syria. To explain how the Fatimids (or ""Babylonians"" as the sources often call them) knew so much, Raymond d'Aguilers explains that after defeating the Fatimids at the Battle of Ascalon in 1100, they found a bundle of letters about the crusaders in the commander's tent: 

> He knew of us that we were few, he knew that Emperor Alexios was hostile to us to the point of death. We found letters of the Emperor Alexios written about us in the tent of the same king, after the battle with the King of the Babylonians had been fought at Ascalon.

When the crusade reached Antioch, the governor Yaghi-Siyan sent out letters asking for help to various rulers and to the Caliph in Baghdad to organise a relief army, though to my knowledge no trustworthy accounts of letters about this relief army survive, though the *Gesta Francorum* claims to have one written from its commander - Kerbogha - to the Caliph gloating of how he was about the drive the Franks all the way back to southern Italy. Although the letter is clearly made up, it does show that the crusaders expected that they had no element of surprise as their enemies were regularly in contact via envoys and messengers. If there were Muslim lords in the Middle East who did not know a European army was invading, they knew after the Caliph started writing about it and after the crusaders spent over a year besieging Antioch and then arguing over who should keep it. 

On a more local level, regional lords kept in contact regarding the location and state of the crusading army, sending messages by carrier pigeon. One day, a carrier pigeon happened to be killed by a hawk over the crusader camp, and the contents of the message found attached to it is approximately recorded by Raymond d'Aguilers:

> ""King of Acre, Duke of Caesarea. A canine breed has passed through me, a foolish and contentious people without government, whom you and others desire to harm as much as you love your law. If you want, you can do so easily. Send this to other cities and camps."" 

Another group informing regional lords of the crusade's status were the crusaders themselves. After various leaders decided to establish their own states in the Middle East rather than return to Europe, they began opening diplomatic relations with Muslim rulers to seek legitimacy from their neighbours and explore potential alliances for the post-crusade situation. The awkward part was that some of the leading lords of the crusade all posed as the crusade's one leader, resulting in some very confused Muslim noblemen. Godfrey de Bouillon and Count Raymond were manoeuvring for authority, so both made contact with local Muslim rulers to assert that diplomacy with the crusaders should be done through them and not the other leaders. It also helped that the crusaders had taken some castles that were believed by local rulers to be notoriously hard to crack, which gave the crusaders a level of fame that Count Raymond used to further his diplomatic relations: 

> At this time there were envoys from the Emir of Camela with us and from the King of Tripoli. When these [envoys] heard of our audaciousness and fortitude, they begged permission from the Count [to leave], saying that they would certainly return. Those ambassadors having therefore been dismissed with ours, returned in a short time with great presents and many horses.
For the whole country was terrified by the attack on the castle, since it had never before been attacked by any people. Therefore the inhabitants of that country, with many supplications and gifts, sent to the Count, commanding him that while he should receive their cities and forts, he would in the meantime direct them his standards and seals.

By the point the crusade's leaders were writing to local lords to advertise their presence in the hope of receiving tribute, I think it's safe to say the only way a Muslim would not have been aware of the crusading army's march toward Jerusalem is if they lived under a rock. 

So some Muslim rulers like the Fatimid Caliphate knew the crusade was coming as soon as it showed up in the Byzantine Empire at the latest, because the Byzantines told them. Others found out when it became apparent that the crusade was going to target Antioch, when its governor sent out letters to gather forces and request the assistance of the Sunni Caliph, at which point most Muslim lords would have known that a European army was invading the region, though they perhaps thought they were just Byzantine mercenaries. But after they took Antioch and the crusade's leaders were getting ideas about building their own states in the region, the crusaders themselves were advertising their presence both to help those state-building efforts and vie for control over the army through positioning themselves as the one to do diplomacy with. There were plenty of avenues by which Muslims in the Middle East could learn of this European army marching toward Jerusalem, and these are just the official diplomatic channels. I'd go into how they would have heard from merchants and sailors - there is simply no way to hide the consumption of tens of thousands of people - but unfortunately we know little for sure about how merchants and sailors were threaded into the Middle East's information networks at this time."
AskHistorians,"Countries receiving IMF loans seem perpetually on the brink of financial insolvency. Historically, have many countries receiving IMF loans become economically successful and independent?","I think to answer this it probably helps to back up a bit and explain what the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is. 

The IMF is an international agency under the umbrella of the United Nations: at this point in time, most countries in the world are UN members and are IMF members, although membership in one doesn't automatically mean membership in the other (there are a number of IMF members who are not sovereign states represented as such in the UN, and three UN members do not participate in the IMF). The IMF was the product of the Bretton Woods system in 1944-1945 which sought to stabilize the world economy in the aftermath of the Second World War: the IMF at the time started with 29 members. A full list of members with accession dates can be found [here](https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/memdate.htm) - one thing to notice is that members generally were Western countries (Western Europe and North America), plus Latin America. African countries (the ones not closely aligned with the Soviet bloc) joined in the 1960s, and the Eastern Bloc largely stayed out of IMF membership until the 1980s: it really only became a global organization in the 1990s. Members were and are assessed a quota (basically a membership fee) based on the relative size of its economy. Quotas are also related to voting rights in the IMF, but the two figures aren't exact. Also quotas were originally denominated in US dollars, which were in turn fixed to gold, but with the move away from the Bretton Woods gold-based exchange system ""Special Drawing Rights"" (SDRs) were developed as an alternative type of reserve: it's basically based on a basket of world currencies (currently, the US dollar, Chinese yuan renminbi which was added in 2016, Japanese yen, the Euro and British pound sterling) and defines how much a member country contributes and has a right to ask for. SDRs *aren't loans* - they are the major source of IMF funding (the secondary and tertiary sources being multilateral loans and bilateral loans), and each country has a right to draw its share of SDRs. 
OK, on to the purpose of the IMF. It is effectively a lender of last resort to member countries, at a period when member countries are experiencing macroeconomic challenges like a balance of payments crisis (ie, a country cannot borrow or export enough to pay for its imports). It also originally was drawn on by members as needed to maintain fixed exchange rates, but this purpose disappeared when exchange rates were allowed to float (be set by foreign exchange markets) in the late 1960s/early 1970s. As such, it actually was pretty actively used by members, especially in drawing on SDRs - the United States itself has used those facilities dozens of times, such as drawing a few billion dollars' worth of Deutsche Mark and Yen in 1978 to prop up the US dollar on the exchange market. 

The IMF does offer loans as well, but these tend to be to countries that are lower income (and have less SDRs) and that are macroeconomically unstable. Loans aren't for specific projects like with the World Bank, but are loans to governments/central banks, and perhaps somewhat notoriously often carry requirements for macroeconomic reform along with the loans, and as such can cause extremely painful socioeconomic disruption when implemented. A common example is when a country's government is running a massive deficit and cannot fund its deficit through regular channels of borrowing, it may turn to the IMF for a loan. The IMF will structure a country plan for that loan, and, say, request that the country's government try to balance its budget by cutting fuel and food subsidies (these tend to be insanely expensive for a lot of lower income countries, by the way, and don't necessarily benefit the poorest parts of society). The IMF in this capacity is working with countries that have major monetary and fiscal problems, and/or are facing serious issues with national debt or its financial sector. In other words, countries that already have serious problems and are turning to it as a last resort.

Has the IMF lent money to countries that are economically successful? Absolutely. Often these loans are many times the size of those that low income countries have: but they are generally repaid very quickly. 

One example would be the United Kingdom in 1976. Because of political and economic turbulence (sound familiar?), investors came to believe that the pound was overvalued relative to other currencies, and there was a mass sell off on the pound. Even after drawing on a US-funded loan from the International Bank of Settlements (a different multilateral agency made up of member state central banks), it had to approach the IMF for a loan of $3.9 billion in September 1976 - the largest loan ever given to a member country to that point (the IMF itself needed to seek bilateral funding from the US and Germany to even raise the money). The loan terms imposed a 20% cut to the UK budget deficit - the acceptance was heavily debated by the British cabinet, but ultimately accepted because the alternative seemed to be a disastrous run on the pound on foreign exchange markets. In any case, the full loan wasn't ever actually utilized, and Britain was able to pay the drawn amount back in several years thanks to a stabilized British economy, and increased oil revenues from North Sea oil. 

Another example would be South Korea. In 1997, a financial crisis started in Southeast Asia which led foreign investors to become very nervous about continued investment in South Korea, especially after a number of corporate bankruptcies happened there. As such, Korea was unable to roll over short term debt it owed to international creditors, and foreign investors sold off Korean shares. This meant that Korea's foreign reserves ended up being almost depleted, and would lead to a sharp economic downturn. In November of 1997, Korea approached the IMF for a loan and received one valued at $58 billion - again, the largest loan to a member to date, and one that drew funding from the World Bank, Asian Development bank, and bilateral funding sources for a three year agreement. Part of the terms imposed was that Korea set high interest rates as a means of attracting back foreign investors and to stabilize its currency (of course in the short term this deepened the recession). Korea was able to recover though, and again it only (""only"") drew about $30 billion of the loan. Once its foreign reserves and balance of payments recovered, it also was able to repay the loan by 2001. 

Not to get outside of the 20 year rule, but by 2007 most countries had low to no balances with the IMF: its loan total was the lowest it had been in in decades. The loan sheet increased dramatically with the 2008 recession, of course, but many of these loans were to European countries. Currently the biggest IMF loan debtors are Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine and Pakistan. 

So the issue is that low income countries that get into severe balance of payments crises, or debt crises aren't necessarily taking the *biggest* loans (a country like Guinea gets tens of millions in IMF loans compared to South Korea getting tens of billions), but that they are often the least able to pay them back. As even happened with the UK, often a country needs to improve its balance of payments and foreign reserves by selling commodities: when commodity prices are high, this is easy (as was the case in the 2000s) when they are low (which usually coincides with global economic downturns and decreased availability of financing for low income countries) this is much harder. Just to take Guinea again - it's a very low income country that exports gold and aluminum, and has to import pretty much anything else (including financial capital): if these export prices are good, the country is in good shape; if the prices drop, the country can not only experience a major balance of payments crisis, but also have trouble repaying an IMF loan it will need in that very crisis. The IMF loan terms are often very controversial, again as can be seen with Britain in 1976: often the IMF wants to see fiscal stability (cutting budget deficits) or monetary stability (raising interest rates) which often impose austerity and can actually make an economic downturn worse, at least in the short run."
AskHistorians,Why Doesn't English Have Grammatical Genders?,"I will speak about the linguistics of English because that is where my expertise lies.

While it may seem like English is a “hodge-podge” of Germanic and Romance languages, this is true only if you look at the lexicon (vocabulary) of English. But vocabulary is not the only way to classify languages, and it can actually be one of the most deceptive. While English does have a lot of words borrowed from Latinate languages, English *functions* more like a Germanic language because it is a Germanic language. In other words, even if English borrows a verb from another language like French, the way it conjugates that verb will more closely resemble German, Danish, Faroese, or any other arbitrarily selected Germanic language. Sometimes these similarities are obscured behind pronunciation differences, but they become much easier to spot with more linguistic training.

Also, many of the words that English borrowed from French, Latin, and Greek were actually cognates with existing Germanic English words. Cognates are words that share an etymological origin. They derive from the same ultimate root word. An example of this is *heart*, a native English word, and *cardiac*, a Latinate borrowing. These words are actually cognates and ultimately derive from the same word spoken thousands of years ago. Population migrations and sound changes are responsible for the differences in pronunciation, with [Grimm’s law](https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/IE_Main5_Grimm.html) being particularly consequential here. An example of how spelling in particular can lie is the fact that the English words [*island*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/island) and [*isle*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/isle) are not in any way etymologically related despite the similarities in meaning, spelling, and pronunciation.

My point is to be very careful when drawing conclusions about the history of a language based primarily on modern features unless you can put those features in context. It took linguists decades and even centuries to uncover the true history of the English language.

Then there’s the issue of gender. Old English, from which Modern English evolved, did have a rich and complex system of nominal (noun-related) gender. Over time, English grammar started to lose these grammatically gendered inflections, a process that was hastened by the Norman invasion of England in 1066, after which Norman French established itself as the dominant language of the monarchy, aristocracy, and educated elite. [ETA: Many people have rightfully pointed out that the effect of the Norman invasion is a contentious issue. See the comments downthread for this discussion.]

But the vestiges of grammatical gender are still present in English pronouns. The *he-she-it* paradigm of pronouns in modern English is inherited directly from the historical *masculine-feminine-neuter* paradigm present in all Old English nouns. So the gender of modern pronouns isn’t some separate phenomenon. It is itself a manifestation of grammatical gender, just extremely narrow in scope. [ETA: The current gender paradigm is sometimes called *natural gender*. Rather than assigning arbitrary grammatical gender to nouns and pronouns, gender is determined by intrinsic qualities of what’s being referred to.]

ETA: I realized that I didn’t specifically answer the question about definite articles because I thought it was implied. Old English had a [complex set of determiners](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Old_English/Articles) that inflected for gender, number, and case. As the gender and case system collapsed, these inflected forms eventually disappeared, leaving only what would become *the*, *that*, *those*, *this*, and *these*."
AskHistorians,How did the army jacket become a symbol of punk and counter culture past the 70s?,"So this is not exactly what you asked, but I can suggest ""'We are the Mods’: A Transnational History of a Youth Culture” by Christine Jacqueline Feldman which is a doctoral thesis from 2009. It's more about Mod culture obviously but it's extremely comprehensive and goes into a lot of the background of changes in youth culture of the post war era which is general background for how subcultures were increasingly conscious of identifying themselves with hyper stylized dress.  

Punk had a lot of roots in skinhead culture both in dress and music. Skinheads were mods but also developed in response *to* mods as a rejection of the sort of clean cut posh mod culture of the early 60s and more consciously identified as working class and  masculine. Obviously army gear accomplished both those goals, as most people being sent to war were working class men.  Things like military jackets (bombers) and boots were a way to project masculine toughness more or less.  They loved ska and reggae which was core to the later British punk movement, both the music itself and that larger rejection of white rock hegemony to seek out more diverse and authentic artistic inspiration.  That connection between ska and punk via the skinheads was very important and very direct and has persisted through second and third wave ska and into contemporary music culture.

The simple answer is the people who became the early generation of punks grew up watching the anti-war protesters and the skinheads and whoever else and thought they looked cool, looked radical.  Punk grew out of an environment where these conventions were well established. Punk was also self consciously left wing, and of course growing up with popular images of Black Panthers and anti-war protesters co-opting military symbols for countercultural purposes, it was a very intentional choice to align themselves with previously established leftist countercultural vernacular.

From Feldman: 

> Nowadays, ironically, I appreciate what was happening in the seventies and probably dress more like that… probably… But, at the time, it was square. You hated it. You hated flare trousers, you hated big lapels, you hated shoulder-length hair, because it just seemed like fashion had lost its way and culture had lost its way. I think the punks started that where they looked at what was happening in the 70s…full of hippies and people…very drab…very boring in a lot of ways. Glam rock was the only exciting spark that was happening then and that soon died. And by about ’75, that sort of time, it was a sort of nowhere-land. British culture was like…seemed to have lost its way, and I think, the people who got punk together understood that. They took a lot of sixties influences and so did we several years later. We thought, ‘Yeah, we agree,’ cause we were on the tail-end of when punk happened and bands like Buzzcocks and what have you. They, to us, were quite next-door to Mod."
AskHistorians,"Is there a serious answer to the joke ""How come White people conquered the world for spices but didn't use them in their food?""","The simple serious answer is that they used, and still use, spices in their food.

Since before Roman times, the most important imported spice used in Europe has been black pepper. Black pepper was the mainstay of the spice trade, with spice cargoes on ships often being about 50% black pepper by value. Since black pepper prices were lower than those of other spices (ginger, often the second-most important spice was usually 1-3 times the price of pepper, and cloves and nutmeg were usually 5-20 times the price of pepper), the fraction of pepper by tonnage was even higher.

Black pepper, heavily used in antiquity (e.g., about 80% of the recipes in Apicius use black pepper), is still the ubiquitous European/US/Australia table spice, and sees much use in Western cooking. Black pepper alone is a strong disproof to the claim that ""white people don't use spices"".

The use of some other spices, such as ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg, in savoury Western dishes has declined since Medieval times, but such spices are still common in modern European baking, such as a variety of ginger biscuits and gingerbread, cinnamon rolls, and spice cakes. While these are typically snacks or desserts rather than the main course of a main meal, snacks are desserts are still food.

The Price Edict of Diocletian lists black pepper at 800 denarii per pound (Roman pound of approx. 330g). The same amount of money would buy about 108kg of wheat (at 100 denarii for a double bushel). Thus, black pepper was about 300 times the price of wheat. Today, Western supermarket prices for (cheap) black pepper are typically about 30 times that for (cheap) flour. Black pepper is still much more expensive than wheat, but modern pepper is relatively cheap compared to ancient pepper. When did this price drop? Much of this reduction in price was in the mid-17th century, with a drop to 1/5 of the medieval price courtesy of the maritime spice trade carried in European ships (and the breaking of the Portuguese monopoly by the Dutch). 

This drop in price has been accompanied by an increase in consumption. Late medieval pepper imports into Europe were about 1000t per year, while today about 85,000t are imported per year. Since the modern European population is about 10 times greater than the late medieval population, per capita consumption has increased about 8.5 times (and prices have dropped by a factor of 10).

The modern European pepper consumption is about 0.1kg per year. The average annual per capita consumption of all spices, worldwide, is about 1kg per year. The growth in availability of spice-rich ethnic cuisine in Europe over last half century or so has surely increased per capita spice consumption in Europe, but much of that growth has been in spices other than pepper. Many European countries still have fairly low spice consumption, about 0.1-0.3kg per capita per year (and much of this will be black pepper), while others have much higher spice consumption (e.g., the UK with about 0.6kg, which certainly owes something to Indian takeaway having become a national dish in England, and the Netherlands with about 1.4kg (which is not insignificant compared to spice-heavy countries such as India at about 2.7kg)).

However, to return to your original point, ""White people conquered the world for spices"" isn't really true. The Dutch East India company didn't import pepper and other spices into Europe in order to give Europeans access to more and cheaper spices. They did it to make money. Profit margins on spices could vary from 25% to 200%, and with the high price of spices by weight or volume, a cargo of spices could be very valuable and very profitable. It would be more accurate to say that ""White people conquered the world for profit"", and spices were a convenient way to gain those profits. Those profits wouldn't have existed if there was no demand for spices in Europe (i.e., if Europeans didn't use spices), so European spice usage was important, but profit was still the direct motive for the trade."
AskHistorians,"George Washington is known for warning about the pernicious influence of political parties and polarization. But given how few democracies or republics there were in his day, what examples would Washington have been thinking of?","Washington had in mind the factional politics of ancient democracies and republics, those of Greece and especially Rome. Antiquity was all the rage during the late 18th century and there were tons of popular books telling and retelling stories from the ancient world. 

A recurrent theme of these histories was that internal divisions within republics was one of the most common reasons for their downfall. Of particular concern was class conflict pitting the poor and middle classes against the rich. Factional conflict between these groups frequently led either to civil war or to one faction collaborating with a foreign power to take the republic over and put their faction in charge. Conflict between rich and poor--or patricians and plebeians--was famously what sparked a generation-long civil war from Marius and Sulla to Caesar, Antony, and Octavian, ultimately destroying the Roman republic. 

This stuff was very widely known at the time, so what Washington was doing was trying to link that history to the emerging 'factional' or proto-party politics of the new United States. It's important though to note that factions or parties in the 18th century sense have little in common with political parties as we know them. They were viewed more like seditious conspiracies against the currently incumbent government as well as the constitution than as legitimate competitors for power advancing a distinct political program. Parties in this latter sense emerged over the course of the long 19th century, particularly in Europe. American parties, though they emerged far earlier than European ones, remained weak and lacked united party programs until the cusp of the 20th century.

AskHistorians,How prevalent was homosexuality in the navy during world war 2? Is there any recorded history about it?,"I'm going to answer this from the perspective of the Royal Navy, which I'm much more familiar with and can write about in much more detail. As such, it's not directly applicable to the US Navy in the specifics - that said, the broad attitudes described seems to match from my limited reading on the topic. This answer draws largely on a couple of answers I've previously written about how [gay and LGBT men ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cwokec/z/eyf170b) experienced the RN during WWII, as well as [an answer on LGBT women in the WRNS in the same period](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cwqe1r/how_was_female_homosexuality_viewed_in_the_womens/eygzvf7), as well as the [combination here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/w9pp0l/was_the_british_navy_really_rum_sodomy_and_the/), largely because I've seen little new information on it. 

Social histories of the RN written by naval historians tend to, where they do discuss homosexuality, use the memoirs and recollections of heterosexual sailors. This means that their descriptions are coloured by innuendo, rumour and stereotypes, and do not necessarily reflect the real experiences of LGBT sailors. One exception is Christopher McKee's *Sober Men and True*, which while a slightly older work, takes a more measured, critical approach to interview testimony to give a useful account. A more useful, taken by Matthew Seligmann in his *Rum, Sodomy, Prayers, and the Lash Revisited*, is to look at medical and court-martial records. This gives a more reliable look at the topic, especially in periods like the early 1910s when we have little personal testimony on queer experiences in the Navy. However, it is also necessarily a less personal one, influenced heavily by official homophobia, and cannot really give a deep insight into the experiences of LGBT men in these periods. Histories of LGBT servicemen, meanwhile, take a more general view, looking at all three services, which means they may miss some of the intricacies of naval life and culture. Historians writing such studies also frequently face opposition and obstruction from the veteran's groups they need to work with to contact LGBT servicemen and women, limiting the extent to which these works can cover the issues. In particular, I don't think I've seen any testimony from a queer woman in the WRNS about her experiences specifically as a queer woman. As a result, this answer will, necessarily be limited by this lack of source material.

As a second historiographical note, we cannot necessarily extend modern concepts of sexuality and gender to these periods. Many of the sailors who engaged in sex with other men were married to women. While we might now identify these men as bisexual, they would have identified themselves as straight to others in their society. Equally, they did not have the same understanding of gender identity - some of the people discussed in this answer, might, if living now, identify as trans, but did not necessarily have the ability, understanding or vocabulary to do so at the time. To avoid presentism, queer historians use the term 'homosex' to describe sexual activity between two people of the same sex. I will follow this practice in this answer.

Legally speaking, queer men were banned from serving in the Royal Navy until 2000. Despite this, it was able to maintain a reputation for homosexuality. Given this dual reputation, it should not be surprising that the experience of many queer sailors was similar. They had to hide their sexuality from senior officers, censors, medical boards and other representatives of the navy's institutions who might disapprove or punish them, while being able to be more free and open about it with their shipmates. Many accounts describe this tension, between 'passing' and openness, and it should always be kept in mind when discussing the topic.

Naval punishments could be harsh when it came to homosexuality. Section 45 of the Naval Discipline Act stated that ""If he
shall be guilty of Sodomy with Man or Beast he shall suffer penal servitude"", a charge second only to the death penalty. However, in most cases, less serious punishments were preferred, using lesser charges, or discharges for medical reasons and 'services no longer required'. Courts-martial for such offences were pretty much life-ruining. In 1939, the First Lieutenant of *Hood*, accused of an indecent advance towards a junior seaman, chose to commit suicide rather than stand trial. However, the Navy was also somewhat more tolerant than either the Army or the RAF. Over the course of the war, 32 RN officers would face a court-martial for indecent offences, of which just 20 would be convicted. The Army prosecuted 161 officers for the same charges, with 103 of these being convicted. The Navy was often unwilling to bring courts-martial, especially for officers. These were public affairs, which could be damaging to the service's reputation; instead, officers accused of homosexuality were often discreetly but firmly encouraged to resign from the service. Officers were willing to overlook transgressions of the rules around sexuality, especially for men who were seen as valuable to the ship's functioning. For example, Dennis Prattley, a signalman aboard an RN destroyer, was kept in the Navy despite admitting his sexuality to a number of officers and medical examiners. There were other aspects of naval society that protected queer men. It was a hard charge to prove, since without physical evidence, proof came down to eyewitness testimony - and as long as the sex was consensual, this was hard to obtain. Those in authority were also unwilling to risk starting a scandalous case that might damage the morale aboard ship, especially since any sort of sexual misconduct aboard tended to draw mockery from other ships' crews. That said, ships' doctors were one of the RN's main systems for identifying queer men. As men would visit them for treatment for STDs, examinations prior to these treatments could reveal that they had been having sex with other men, and so medical officers were encouraged to provide such information to their seniors. 

While queer men had to hide their sexuality from naval institutions, they could be more free with their shipmates. Many were willing to overlook their comrade's sexuality as long as they were good sailors. A. W. Weekes described a typical naval view:

> ‘You accepted
the chap as he was. If he was a good messenger or a good pal. [Non-sailors]
can’t understand the passionate feeling about sailors collectively.’

Others might well view it as a joke. Sailors aboard HMCS *Sackville* would apparently laugh when they encountered their shipmates in a mutual embrace. Some queer men might well play up to this stereotype as a way to break tensions and establish a space for themselves. Freddie, a coder aboard a British corvette, used impersonations of well-known personalities like Gracie Fields and Vera Lynn to prevent rising stresses. Homosexuality was often understood as one of the little infractions, the petty crimes, that crews would get away with. Covering up the actions of their shipmates was a way to mock the naval authorities, and helped to develop an esprit-de-corps. While they had some support from their comrades, gay men often had to prove their status. Sub-lieutenant John Beardmore, a queer RN officer, felt that 

>[queer] men were very often much braver than straight men because they had …
the feeling that they had to make a stand to prove themselves … I know
many cases where queer men went, paid enormous risks and were totally
without fear’.

Others chose to defend their sexuality with humour. Terry (or Terri) Gardner, an RN cook who was very explicit about his sexuality, felt that this was a key part of his ability to fit in to the crew:

> People
were just thankful to get through the day and if I was there to give them
a laugh, it was a bonus, wasn’t it.

While he faced hostility for his sexuality, he would respond to this in a crude, mocking way, establishing his place in the crew. The lower deck was not always so accepting. Sailors would often disapprove of relationships that transgressed the boundaries of rank. Such relationships were often seen to result in favouritism, and caused bitterness. Acceptance also varied from ship to ship, with some being more or less willing to overlook sexual transgressions.

The RN's systems created spaces where queer men could exist, and find companionship. One key area was the 'wingers and oppos' system, a way of mentoring and training new recruits. Wingers were older men, while oppos were seamen at a similar level in terms of age and rank to new sailors, with both being assigned to mentor new seamen. This mentoring created a relatively close relationship, that could often develop into a companionship or sexual relationship. A sailor interviewed by McKee suggested that up to 30% of these developed into some form of queer relationship. When the Navy wasn't fighting, concert parties, or 'Sod's Operas' were common. These had all-male casts, but often had female parts, for which men had to cross-dress. Queer men often used these parts as a way to perform and experiment with new expressions of their gender. Some might even become full-time performers, and win exemption from their duties."

AskHistorians,"In 1788, Pennsylvania passed a law which called for slaves brought into the state to be freed within six months. How robust was the enforcement of this law?","This question actually pertains to a really interesting point of time in the history of the Republic. For reference, Pennsylvania's *Gradual Emancipation Act* passed the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1780, nine years prior to General Washington being sworn in as the first President of the United States and seven years before any states ratified the Constitution.

The short answer to your question is that enforcement was actually fairly decent. As a rule, slave masters were protective of their property and would bend or even break the rules to retain the people they enslaved. Even when laws were passed guaranteeing freedom to those individuals, the enforcement of that guarantee depended on the reach and awareness of a fledgling justice system. However, this did not prevent private citizens (abolitionists) from alerting the local judiciary to begin the process of freeing those enslaved within (*and as you'll see momentarily, sometimes those outside of*) the borders of Pennsylvania.

The most notable conflict regarding this law began sometime before the revolution when a Maryland slave owner of the surname Davis moved with his slave John to what he may have believed was northwest Virginia. In 1779, the region where they had moved had been absorbed into Washington County, Pennsylvania. This was relevant because  although the law would emancipate newborns, masters could pay a registration fee until November 1, 1780 to retain slaves born prior to its enactment. Many slave owners ignored this requirement, particularly those on the Virginia border due to the region not being formally settled until 1784. 

In 1788, John Davis (taking on his master's surname) was taken to Ohio County, Virginia where he was hired out to work against his will. Soon after, abolitionists aware of his situation found him and returned him to Pennsylvania a free man, under the pretense that his master had not paid the aforementioned fee. Some months later the man who had been renting John, now scared that he might be liable to replace him, hired three bounty hunters to capture John in Pennsylvania and return him to slavery in Virginia. Those three men would be indicted by a Pennsylvania grand jury in 1788 for the crimes of kidnapping and assault. They never appeared in court.

Had this matter only occurred in Pennsylvania, John being rescued likely would have been the end of it. Abolitionists were no strangers to utilizing State power to achieve their ends, particularly in states where the law favored them. But because the country was so young (*Pennsylvania and Virginia both having ratified the Constitution less than a year prior,*) when legal battles involving slavery became interstate conflicts, seeking legal resolution became difficult because the question of whether one state's laws should apply to the citizens of another state was still unsettled. This mattered, because the enforcement of the Gradual Emancipation Act now hinged on whether the laws of Pennsylvania could apply to citizens of Virginia. 

We jump ahead by roughly two years. The Governor of Pennsylvania requests that Virginia extradite the three men who abducted John Davis in order to bring them to trial. When the Governor of Virginia refused, Pennsylvania's counterpart writes to President Washington to request federal support in arresting the three fugitives. Washington asks Jefferson, his Secretary of State, for advice. Jefferson passes the issue on to Attorney General Randolph who had recently coached Washington in how to legally skirt the Pennsylvania abolition law himself. (*This fact is a relevant hint, as it indicates that the law was enforced to such an extent as to require such legal guidance.*) Randolph finds both Governors at fault.

(*It is relevant too that a case revolving around the abduction of a Pennsylvanian citizen who had previously been a slave of that same state could reach the Governor's desk. It exemplifies how serious this law was being treated, and serves as an example of what those abolitionists were doing behind the scenes to make it happen.*)

Randolph found that the Pennsylvanian governor failed to provide sufficient evidence that the accused had ""fled from ... justice,"" while the Virginian governor, on the advice of his own attorney general, was faulted for attempting to delegitimize the crime by referring to it as an act of ""trespass"" rather than ""felonious assault and kidnapping."" On Randolph's advice, Washington asks both Governors for ""more information"" hoping that they would settle the matter themselves. This particular case would in fact never be resolved, though Congress at the behest of President Washington would pass a law in 1793 to define some guidelines to follow should it ever happen again.

The takeaway here is that slavery at this point in American history remained a point of ferverous contention, and the ability of those in bondage to garner political will in their favor largely depended on the legal repertoire of their local abolitionist organizations. In the case of Pennsylvania in 1788, the language of the law was clearly in their favor and they were eager to act on it without the slaves needing to make much noise themselves.

AskHistorians,How do old buildings end up so deep?,"Be warned, the answer’s rather dirty. 

I’m going to focus here on Greco-Bactrian archaeology as an example. Greco-Bactria was a Hellenistic state which ruled regions in present Central Asia from c. 250 to 145 BC. Because of its isolation, few literary evidence survives, so during the 19th century and most of the 20th, historians had to rely on archaeological evidence. And that was a problem, because aside from a few scattered coins picked up by tribesmen or found in hoards like the [Oxus Treasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxus_Treasure), there was absolutely none to speak of. 

Gradually, the lack of findings began to take its toll. One of the greatest Hellenistic archaeologists, Alfred Foucher, spent 18 months digging at Balkh, and found absolutely nothing. Eventually, he labelled the whole discipline as the Greco-Bactrian mirage. However, in 1961, nine years after Foucher’s death, news came of an absolutely ground-breaking discovery on the Afghan-Tajik border by the King of Afghanistan himself. Ai-Khanoum, a near-perfectly preserved Greco-Bactrian city, was buried beneath a layer of dirt so thin that the ruins could be sketched out from the top of a nearby hill.

You see, your question, u/KrishaCZ, is one of human activity. Unless we’re building particularly large structures like skyscrapers, there’s no particular need to dig down so far. For most of human history, we’ve been content to build on top of the collapsed/destroyed previous structures. And of course, the more intense the human activity, the more building, and the more layering.

It turns out that Foucher’s hunch had been right! There was in fact a Greco-Bactrian city beneath Balkh - in fact, known as Bactra, it was probably the capital or second city! However, it’s been inhabited for well over two millennia, much of that time as a major centre on the Silk Road, and thus a top target for invaders such as the Arabs and the Mongols. You can imagine how much building and rebuilding was done during that time. At Balkh and another site in the region, Termez, the Greco-Bactrian ruins lie as much as 15m below the surface. You really can’t blame Foucher for missing them. 

Ai-Khanoum was also either the capital or second city of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. However, after that state fell in c. 145 BC, Ai-Khanoum was unlike Balkh mostly abandoned. A skeleton civilisation limped along until the second century AD, living in the ruins of the city’s palace, but as they had no hope of restoring the magnificent structures around them, they mostly just built on top of the foundations. By the time they disappear from the historical record, they had brought nearly 2m of dirt into the palace to build their shacks and huts on top of. Everywhere else in the city, the ruins lay less than 1m below the surface, which was how the Afghan king was able to easily identify them. 

I suspect that the case of Prague, which has seen it’s fair share of warfare, destruction, and growth over the centuries, is much the same as in Balkh.

I told you it would be dirty.

AskHistorians,"To circumvent the naval articles of the Versailles treaty, the Weimar government created a dummy company in the Netherlands (IvS) to develop U-Boats. How did the UK, France, or the Netherlands not figure out who was behind the company? Did the Germans use any other dummy companies?","The British, at the very least, certainly knew what was going on with IvS, but felt it was a low priority to tackle it. 

In 1922, three German companies, backed by the German Navy, established a new company in Holland. This company, N V Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheesbouw (IvS), built on a number of 1921 deals where these companies had consulted on submarine design in Japan and Argentina (with negotiations ongoing on similar deals for Sweden and Italy). Initially, the Dutch government would not allow it to operate within the country, so it ran covertly in the German port of Kiel. In 1925, it was allowed to register in Holland, letting it move openly to Den Haag. It would operate there for the next twenty years. By 1935, it had worked with Japan, Finland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey, providing assistance with these countries' submarine programmes. This assistance included parts production, provision of designs and supervision of construction. This design experience gave the German Navy a continuity of design experience for submarines, reducing the loss of institutional knowledge. The IvS also researched a number of useful topics, such as electric torpedoes, which were highly useful for the nascent German submarine arm.

While IvS was theoretically covert, it was anything but when it came to the British. In November 1914, a German naval engineer called Karl Krueger had turned up in the British legation in Den Haag. He had been court-martialled and dismissed from the German Navy for striking another officer (a relative of the Kaiser), and sought to gain some revenge on the service that had sacked him. He offered to provide the British large amounts of information on German naval construction, which they gladly accepted. The British Secret Intelligence Service gave him the codename TR16, and established regular monthly meetings with him. They helped him establish a cover as a businessman in Holland, and paid him handsomely for the intelligence he provided. This covered all aspects of the German naval building programme, including the U-boat programme. His reports continued after the end of WWI, and through the interwar period until he was arrested in 1939 and executed.

TR16 provided deep, comprehensive reports on IvS, showing the British that the Germans were trying to establish a covert submarine-building programme. The Foreign Office confirmed this through its own investigations. As a result the British knew that IvS was a front company which had been illegally building submarines at Rotterdam's Ing Fijenhoord shipyard. They also knew that the Finnish were working with the Germans on it. While they knew these details, they did little to stop it. The Royal Navy didn't view it as a significant threat - it's quite possible that they were confident that TR16 would give enough warning if the Germans did try and turn the IvS experience into a real submarine force, but there was also a growing belief that, with sonar and improved anti-submarine warfare training and doctrine, the submarine was something of a solved problem. For the Foreign Office, there were more significant and direct German infringements of the Versailles Treaty to tackle, such as their refusal to pay reparations that led to the Occupation of the Rhineland. There was also a lack of political will to tackle German illegal actions. This was caused by a number of reasons - a desire to keep Germany onside when it came to trade and other disarmament treaties, a general feeling that Versailles had been too harsh and was pushing Germany towards extremism and a lack of an effective enforcement mechanism. Finally, neither the Admiralty nor the Foreign Office may have seen this as being clearly illegal. In 1933, a list of German breaches of the Versailles Treaty was provided to the Cabinet; this did not include the work of IvS in any way."
AskHistorians,"Mongolia asked to join the Warsaw Pact in 1963, but was blocked by Hungary. Why did Mongolia want into a USSR-dominated alliance that so many eastern European countries wanted to escape? Why did Hungary want to keep Mongolia out of the pact?","Was it blocked by Hungary?

From Richard C. Hall, ""War in the Balkans"" [also published almost verbatim in Spencer C. Tucker ""Encyclopedia of the Cold War""]:

>Romania reacted promptly to Moscow’s non-consultation in such a serious matter [= The Cuban Missile Crisis]. In 1963, the Romanian government gave secret assurances to the United States that it would remain neutral in the event of a confrontation between the superpowers. In the same year, Romanian and Polish opposition prevented Khrushchev’s plan to admit Mongolia into the Warsaw Pact. In the mid-1960s, the Warsaw Pact — like NATO —went through a major crisis. The 1965 PCC meeting, invoked by East Germany, demonstrated profound disagreements among Warsaw Pact allies on matters such as the German question, nuclear sharing and nonproliferation, and the Sino-Soviet split.

From Csaba Bekes, ""Hungary's Cold War"":

>Among other things, the Polish leaders objected to Moscow’s lack of consultation with Warsaw Pact member states concerning the nuclear test ban treaty, especially since they had to sign it well after the contract had been concluded. During his negotiations in Budapest in November 1963, Gomułka stated that Cuba intended to join the Warsaw Pact, which would pose a significant threat to the security of the Eastern bloc as well as world peace.65 Therefore, he firmly stated that, should the request be officially submitted, Poland would veto Cuba’s admission. A similar negative Polish stand prevented another Soviet bloc ally, Mongolia, from joining the Warsaw Pact during the same year. This plan was seen in Warsaw as a clearly anti-Chinese move that was to seriously exacerbate the Soviet bloc’s relations with Beijing and make the Sino–Soviet split irreversible. The Polish position was based on the legal argument that the Warsaw Pact was a European defense alliance; therefore, extending it to Asia would be a violation of the statute of the organization.

It is worth noting that Bekes' book, although by a Hungarian historian about Hungary, does not mention Hungary's stance on the Mongol pursuit of Warsaw Pact membership whatsoever.

From Zhihua Shen, ""A Short History of Sino-Soviet Relations, 1917–1991"":

>On 10 July 1963, in a letter to Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, Khrushchev supported Mongolia’s application to join the Warsaw Pact. In reality, Soviet efforts to strengthen ties with Mongolia were meant to target China. On 15 July, Mongolian leader Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal issued a formal request to join the Warsaw Pact, but his request was rejected due to opposition by the Polish and Romanian governments on the grounds that “an initiative with regard to Mongolia might in a certain sense play into the hands of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and could be used to blame our side for carrying the dispute into the area of military alliances and moving down the path of dividing the [socialist] camp along military lines.”

There seems to be broad agreement among historians that there was discontent among the Soviet sattelite states about Khrushchev's various policy steps (notably his behavior in the Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as the Sino-Soviet Split). However, the historians I cited also seem to variously blame the governments of Poland and Romania, whereas Hungary goes underreported.

Khrushchev is a particularly thankful Soviet general secretary for historians to study, as he (along with Gorbachev) is the only Soviet leader who had a life after his tenure in office, giving both men time to write their memoirs. That way, while we certainly should not take what they (or any memoirists) are writing at face value, we can ascertain what they want us to think. Khrushchev broadly paints a picture of a meeting with Zhou Enlai (who was acting on behalf of Mao Zedong himself) in which Zhou seems to seek to secure Soviet agreement to a Chinese annexation of Mongolia.

>The question of relations between China and Mongolia was also closely linked with this whole problem. I would also like to dwell on that subject. The question was raised at a meeting between representatives of the Soviet Union and China. The Chinese side was headed by Mao Zedong, but the question was posed to us by Zhou Enlai.We understood of course that Zhou was saying what Mao had dictated to him.

> Zhou tried to bring the matter up diplomatically: ""How would you view it if Mongolia became part of the Chinese state?""
>
> In reply I objected: ""You are raising a question that is very difficult for us to answer. It concerns the Mongolian People’s Republic and China. It doesn’t concern us.We are a third party.""
>
> Apparently the Chinese had foreseen such a reply, because Zhou immediately said: ""All right. But what is your personal opinion? What would you yourself think about this?""
>
> I answered: ""Our attitude toward the matter would depend on how it was viewed in Ulan-Bator. But I would think that such a proposal would hardly make the Mongolians very happy.How many years now has this republic existed as an independent state, with its own parliament, administration, and army? For them to become part of China now would simply mean to be deprived of their independence. That’s hardly likely to make them happy. Besides, Mongolia is now just about to join the United Nations, and many countries have diplomatic relations with Mongolia. Is it supposed to be deprived of all that? Why? I would say that your proposal would create difficulties for the leaders of Mongolia. But in general I can’t speak for them. I don’t know what they would say."" With that the subject was exhausted. The Chinese didn’t return to it.

Let me just say that I highly doubt that in this conversation (if it took place), Khrushchev would have preemptively declared his country disinterested and neutral. It was not his style to jeopardize Soviet influence in allied socialist states, as can be seen in his actions towards Hungary in 1956, towards East Germany in 1961 or Cuba in 1962. He would have, in my view, certainly not wanted to give the Chinese the impression the USSR was at any point disinterested in the independence of Mongolia.

So the Soviet sattelites seem to have been correct in their fear that Khrushchev's allusions towards Mongolia's Warsaw Pact membership were directed against China — Khrushchev clearly seeks to indicate that Mongolia was in a position where it was rational for the Mongol government to seek closer relations to Moscow to avoid absorption by Beijing.

But Hungary seems to have not played a special role in the blockade."

AskHistorians,How did Israel come to have little to no Reform Jewish representation?,"In short, to answer your question there was a shift in Labour Zionism combined with state preference for Orthodox institutions combined with later immigrants not bringing in Reform with them. 


So firstly, I wanted to correct some things here:

> with so many Jewish Americans arriving to Israel after independence today we see little Reform representation. 

Americans are not the largest group, and overall, there have not been that many Americans immigrating to Israel.

The largest immigration came from Russia, Morocco, and other countries in the Middle East/Near Asia. Roughly it is almost a 50/50 split on NEMA/Europe for the original point of immigration currently. None of those communities would have brought Reform with them. The Russians were persecuted by the Soviets and were largely secularized, the Mizrachi/Sephardic Jews never separated into those groups. 

Israelis are more likely to be Hiloni (secular) than Dati (religious), and there are also many who call themselves Masorti (traditional), although this is not the same as Masorti (Conservative) Judaism those are the three main groups inside Israel, unlike the US where it is largely a Reform/Conservative/Orthodox split.

Reform itself is most popular in the US, but worldwide numbers show a lower representation of Reform, Australia has none, for example where 70% of Jews are Orthodox. In the UK Reform is lower than Orthodoxy and in Canada as well (Masorti/Conservative is the largest) to give a few examples. Although to add here, since it comes as a surprise to some, the Reform in Israel does not count Patrilineal ancestry as they do inside the US, which was a primary driver of Reform's popularity as intermarriage increased among American Jews. 

> In fact, Reform is the one branch of modern Judaism not legally recognized in Israel's religious courts.

I'm having a hard time finding a source for this, although I can tell you that internally Israel recognizes Reform and Conservative conversions for the purposes of making Aliyah, which is secular law, but the Rabbinate does not count them as Jews under religious law. 

The Rabbinate controls who can get married and buried, roughly and they hold the final say on who is Jewish in that regard, and they only recognize an Orthodox definition of Jewishness. They do not see any other type of Judaism other than Orthodox as legitimate. My assumption here is that the above is incorrect, but I am still unsure of what ""in Israel's religious courts"" means, as overall the Rabbinate controls very few aspects of everyday life, although what they do control can have large ramifications.


>but the Rabbinate is Conservative and Orthodox only, from what I understand.

The Rabbinate is a holdover from the Ottoman period, which was then taken on by the British and then was then adopted by the Israeli government. They are only Orthodox, as I mentioned before.

>How did this happen under years of a Socialist government? Was this ever even a question among Labour Zionists?

The early Labor Zionists did not care for religion and did not consider themselves religious. They established socialist communities to place the worker at the center of the social structure. They wanted to ""invert the pyramid"" and pull in Jews who were impoverished, oppressed, and ideologically committed to their brand of Zionism. They sought land to create emancipation in Palestine/Israel where they had largely not had it before in the Jewish diaspora. 

Prior to the first aliyot in the late 1800s, there were communities inside Israel that had been established previously by those who were religious (the ""old Yishuv), those who were fleeing persecution, or those who remained in Israel while others were driven out in contrast to the socialists these groups were religious. 

These religious groups, (largely Sephardic Jews) created Jaffa and Haifa and were living in Jerusalem as well as some Ashkenazi settlements in places like Tzfat (Safed) and Tiberius. 

As another aside here, demographic information is difficult to come by and in some cases incorrect or missing for large periods of time. It is difficult to get an exact estimate of how many people, of any group, were in certain areas. For example, it is possible that Jews were a majority in Jerusalem for various periods, however, that demographic information could also be inexact and sometimes the Ottoman clerks were prone to copy information from prior years to fill in gaps since we see the number fluctuate by large amounts from year to year. 

The Labour movement became the dominant form of Zionism in 1927-1937 and elected David Ben-Gurion as their President in 1935. Ben-Gurion reshaped Labour Zionism from the worker into the idea of Messianic Redemption and echoed those ideas instead of the Labour ideals of the socialist worker being the core or foundation ideal. 

This happened after the establishment of the state of Israel, and some argue that this trend started in an effort by the early settlers to get independence from the British. 

To explain some history here Jewish immigration was severely limited by the British prior to WWII and after in the White Paper of 1939, made in response to Arab Revolts. The policy set forth by that paper lasted until the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948.

Zionism shifted due to the Holocaust and WWII. Many European Jews, despite not being under Nazi control were living in very similar conditions in Displaced Persons camps, these camps were under US control but frequently employed formed Nazi guards. Patton who was in control of these camps had little love for Jews and called Jews ""lower than animals"". Conditions in these camps were atrocious and many tried to immigrate to Israel, some were smuggled in after making long journeys on makeshift boats and overland.   

This refugee crisis, and the resulting shift in world opinion towards Britain's policies plus the British inability to control Palestine eventually caused them to abandon it completely. It also affected Israeli perceptions, creating an ""us vs them"" idea due to the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the refusal of nations to help save Jews prior to the Holocaust (Evian conference) and the resulting Refugee crisis after. 

These events caused Israel's politics to shift so that by the time the State of Israel was established Labour Zionism was not the Socialist Labour-Focused party it was prior to these events, moving from a farm-based worker ideal to the idea of saving world Jewry and a realizing of Messianic Redemption. Even at the foundation of the state most of the Society was urban instead of agricultural. *Some also note that this could have been a pivot to attract American Jewish support as the Cold War started and America was starting to see Communism in a bad light. 

In 1947 Israel took the Ottoman system of Jewish personal status (the Rabbinate), despite saying that Israel should have ""an absence of coercion or discrimination in religious affairs"" 18 religions were recognized at that time yet Orthodox Judaism effectively functions as the state religion. This happened with funding going to only, or primarily Orthodox institutions and state ostracizing non-Orthodox streams. 

Later waves of immigration also did not import reform as they were not introduced to it. Jewish immigration immediately following the creation of the state was Mizrachi (Eastern) Jews between 1948-1956 around 810,000 Mizrachi Jews immigrated to Israel. As I mentioned earlier, there was no split of these Jews into the divisions we see among Ashkenazim and they would just consider themselves Jews, not ""Reform"" or ""Conservative"" or ""Orthodox"". 

Later waves of immigrants came from Russia from the former Soviet Union when Gorbachev finally allowed the Refuseniks and other Jews to leave and immigrate to Israel. These groups were largely secular due to the USSR's repressive policies on Jews. These groups would not have seen themselves as ""Reform"", etc. as their view of Jewishness is largely ethnic based, because of the USSR's policies 

So overall as I said initially Reform never really took hold in Israel due to a few factors, for starters, it was never really brought into Israel in large numbers, and policies in Israel clearly preferred and supported Orthodox Judaism.

AskHistorians,Why is gold so valuable? I just can't see how a weak shiny piece of metal be so valuable,"Gold has a number of properties which shaped how it was used by early metalworking societies.

* It is soft and easy to work, compared with other metals, which made it suitable for finely detailed decorative objects, but not very useful for making utilitarian goods like tools or weapons.
* It does not tarnish or decay, which made it good for making jewelry and other objects of display.
* It is rare, which meant that it was a resource that an elite could monopolize by controlling either the mines and workshops in which it was produced or the trade routes through which it was acquired.

With these properties, gold became associated with the elite who possessed and displayed it. Its lack of practical utility was part of its appeal, because the ability to acquire and display a large amount of it represented a lost opportunity to acquire and put to use more practical goods. Demonstrating the ability to sustain such a loss demonstrated the extent of the possessor's wealth and power. In early societies without mass media, where political life happened face to face, such tangible displays of status were important in reinforcing the power of the elite. Not every early metalworking society in the world made such associations with gold, but enough did that the metal became one of the preeminent markers of status in many parts of the world.

Because gold was associated with elite displays of wealth and power, it came to acquire cultural significance as a material on its own. A tradition that emerged in early Iranian society described the past as a descent through a series of four ages, each connected with a metal: an ideal golden age, a good but imperfect silver age, a flawed but heroic bronze age, and finally a fallen and debased age of iron. This schema was taken up by the Greeks and later by the Romans, from which it became part of Western tradition, so that we still speak of a past era of glory as a ""golden age."" Similar cultural associations with gold appear in many other cultures.

Since gold was widely in demand, regions that had their own sources of gold used it as a trade good to exchange for goods from abroad. Some regions, including Mesopotamia, the eastern Mediterranean, India, and China, developed a custom of producing ingots, bars, rods, or other shaped lumps of metals--not just gold but also silver, copper, tin, iron, and lead--in more or less standardized weights to facilitate exchanges. This custom eventually developed into the minting of coins, lumps of metal of standardized weight stamped with images to identify their source and verify their weight and purity. Gold and silver were widely used as metals for coinage because they had high exchange value for their weight and they were not in demand to make tools or weapons. 

As the use of coinage spread, so did the association of gold and silver with the acquisition of wealth through labor and trade rather than elite power. Because coins readily passed from one hand to another and were easy to carry and conceal, gold in a monetized economy was much harder for an elite to monopolize than it had been in earlier societies. As a result, a contrary narrative about gold developed which denigrated it as ""filthy lucre,"" a sign of dishonesty and a goad toward greed and evil. This narrative existed alongside and in tension with the older tradition associating gold with virtuous perfection. 

The tension between these two cultural narratives around gold still exists today: we award gold medals but complain about golden parachutes. The paradox informs a line that has been reused by a number of authors: ""Once we had wooden altars and golden priests; now we have golden altars and wooden priests."""
AskHistorians,"Floating Feature: Conspiracy Theories and ""History"" That Makes No Sense","One of the weirdest conspiracy theories I've seen of the past few years is the idea that ""nuclear weapons don't exist."" The basic idea is that nuclear weapons are a hoax created and maintained by the governments of the world (and apparently all scientists who could easily disprove the idea) in order to scare people and maintain control. It's a profoundly stupid conspiracy theory and I usually decline to engage with it because that just gives it more attention, but since we're here, I'll post a tiny bit on it.

Aside from the generalized version above, the specific claims of the advocates of this theory are that nuclear weapons can't exist because of some specific scientific aspects that make them impossible. It is an odd claim and the kind of thing that can sucker in people who only half-understand the technical aspects. Basically they agree that moderated nuclear fission reactions are possible. These are the kinds of reactions you see in most nuclear reactors, where neutrons are slowed down (moderated) prior to fissioning a uranium-235 nucleus. Moderating neutrons dramatically increases the chance of them causing a fission reaction. 

In a bomb, there is no time for moderating neutrons, and so they use fast reactions. This means the possibility of any given neutron fissioning any given nucleus is very low — orders of magnitude lower than a moderated neutron. And so, the conspiracy theorists say, bomb reactions are impossible.

The funny thing is, they are halfway towards a correct idea. Fast fission reactions _are_ much more unlikely than moderated ones! But... that's why you enrich the uranium to such high levels, or use plutonium. That's why reactor fuel can be unenriched or very low enriched, and bomb fuel cannot. You compensate for the low probability of the reaction happening by increasing the possible ""targets"" for the faster neutrons. That's why making a nuclear reactor is relatively easy and making a nuclear bomb is relatively difficult — because you have to create very specific conditions for the latter to achieve its chain reaction. It's this last step that they always miss. It's a weird argument, because it requires a somewhat more technical understanding than most people have... but also requires you to not actually understand the implications of those technical aspects. 

Anyway, that's the ""technical"" argument. You might then ask, how do they deal with, you know, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the many decades of nuclear testing? And of course, the answer to that is essentially, ""Hiroshima and Nagasaki were just firebombings, which is why they sort of look like Tokyo did after it got firebombed."" Which is an interesting argument to me because it is sort of an unanticipated extension of the argument that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were _morally_ and _ethically_ similar to the Tokyo firebombings because they got a _similar_ physical result. But _similar_ is not the same thing as _identical_ and there are _many_ ways to tell the difference between a nuclear attack and a firebombing attack. Radiation, obviously, which leaves a ""signature"" that can be tracked for decades and decades, and can be uniquely associated with a nuclear bomb reaction and not a nuclear reactor reaction (in case you are imagining, as they sometimes do, that you could ""fake"" a nuclear bomb by dropping nuclear reactor byproducts along with your conventional attack — the reactions are different-enough to leave significantly different ratios of byproducts, and anyone with enough will, interesting, and education can confirm this with pretty standard scientific instruments). But there are other differences as well — the atomic bombs had a massively powerful pressure wave emanating from a point source, which snapped trees and toppled buildings and did other things that are really obviously not the same thing as napalm bombings. The heat wave also produced very unusual effects like the famous nuclear ""shadows,"" the angles of which will tell you that they came from a single, immense output from a point source.

Obviously the conspiracy theorists have an answer for all of the above: all the data is faked, everyone is lying, every scientist involved (in all nations) who has ever investigated this stuff is ""in"" on the conspiracy, etc. etc. etc. All nuclear test footage and photographed is faked (never mind that even today it is pretty hard to make compelling fake nuclear test footage, and that they certainly didn't have that technology in the 1940s and 1950s), the millions and millions of pages of internal government documentation were faked, every scientist who has ever worked for the government is either in on it or a stooge, etc. etc. The fact that everyone alive during the years of atmospheric testing have some remnants of fallout in their bones is just like, your opinion, man. The fact that there are literally thousands of people who survived the atomic bombings, and describe them in vivid and horrid detail, and describe exactly what they looked like and felt like, and the fact that only a single bomb dropped by a single plane destroyed their city... their views count for nothing in this mindset. Which, when you think about it, is not only stupid, but pretty offensive.

Which is to say, it's an anti-epistemology, it doesn't generate knowledge, it just tries to undermine it. It is a dead end, like most conspiracy theories. It also has a quality that most conspiracies about scientific topics have, in which random joe-schmoes on the Internet decide that they have somehow discovered a simple scientific error and that, remarkably, not a single person actually trained in advanced physics for the last 80 years ever noticed this or pointed it out, or will underwrite these claims today. The hubris of these theories always impresses me. Like, just what are the sheer odds that someone without a science background would successfully discover such a simple thing? What are the odds that all of the power of the world would be able to keep other, actually-trained scientists, from noticing such an obvious ""blunder""? What are the odds that literally every government in the world would agree on, well, _anything_? 

Again, this is a very silly theory and generally speaking, from what I can tell, even most self-described ""conspiracy theorists"" think it is profoundly dumb — perhaps even performatively so, in a ""I am even more hardcore than you"" self-differentiation among people willing to accept truly stupid conspiracies.

I've had some back and forth with people who believe these things, and of course like all such theorists they are not really truth seekers at all, and have no actual arguments to rebut any points I would make. One of them finally got to the end of their logical thread and thought it might be compelling (to me of all people) to note how many Jews were involved in the Manhattan Project. Sigh. 

There are other nuclear history conspiracies that I don't really want to waste time writing up, but a brief list: a) that the Japanese and/or Germans actually developed nuclear weapons and the US just stole them, b) that the Port Chicago disaster was actually nuclear in nature, c) that the Japanese offered a full surrender prior to the bombs and it was ignored (which I [have written on at some length](https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2022/05/06/did-the-japanese-offer-to-surrender-before-hiroshima-part-2/)). 

Here's the thing. There were actual ""conspiracies"" in a literal definition of the term. There no doubt still are secret plots regarding nuclear history. But none of the above come close to being at all legitimate. I'll hear out any unorthodox theory — if I could show it was true, what a career boost that would be! The people who believe in these theories fundamentally misunderstand how academia works: going against the grain is _rewarded_... _IF_ you can actually pull it off. But these are all empty and pointless wastes of time."
AskHistorians,[Meta]? I'd like to hire a historian to serve as an advisor for a project. How should I go about that?,"I'm an historian who has needed in the past to hire a research assistant capable of looking into areas that I can't do for myself, predominantly because of language barriers. The technique I used, which worked very successfully for me, was to find out the names of senior academics at leading universities who worked in the relevant field. I got hold of their email addresses, and wrote explaining that I was offering paying work, and asking if they had any PhD students with the necessary skill-sets who might be interested in such an assignment. Of course I also did my best not to appear as a time-waster by stressing my own qualifications and pointing out the project was associated with a book that had already been commissioned and would be appearing from a reputable publisher.

Most senior historians of this sort regularly supervise a small group of PhD students. The combination of approaching experts with the right background, and the poor pay/grants that bedevil doctoral candidates meant I was able to find skilled help from students with excellent research skills who were very glad to have the assignment and the money."
AskHistorians,"Was Ebenezer Scrooge coded as a puritan (or dissenter/calvinist/non-conformist/etc.)? His dislike of Christmas, odd first-name, and commitment to profit are all stereotypes of English evangelical minorities in this period.","The earlier form of poor relief was typically through the parish.  Landowners, ""rate payers"", would pay a tax. That money would be used to pay for the housing and feeding of the destitute, and there would be someone from the Anglican Church involved in administering it. It could be a periodic dole of bread from a door of the church, or administering a poor house.  That poor relief was, essentially, unrestricted- anyone could show up at the church, ask for food, help.

As the Industrial Revolution got underway, some parishes increased more in population than rate-payers, got more poor people than the rate-payers would/could support. So, it was thought that numerous small poor houses could be combined into one big poor house, to save money. It was also felt ( especially by people like Jeremy Bentham) that simply offering food and lodging was encouraging people to be lazy. To that end, the big poor houses were re-concieved as work houses: all the destitute would be then set to work for their sustenance and lodging. And moved outside of the authority of the Anglican Church, with the notions of free Christian charity and mercy done away with. So, when Scrooge is asked for a donation, and replies, ""are there no workhouses?"", he's showing himself to be a modern man. 

Likewise, when he talks about the poor dying to 'reduce the surplus population"", he is echoing Thomas Malthus, who had concluded that population grew exponentially but food production only arithmetically, so human populations would tend to run out of food.  Not the last time that someone would say
 being a cold, callous,  businessman is just being ""scientific"", not selfish.  

It would be  discovered that the large work houses had problems. First, the most common reason people were appealing for poor relief was that they were incapable of working in the first place: they were damaged , crippled, too old- and so it was hard to use them as a source of labor, to make the work house pay for itself. They usually were set to picking oakum. Tons of old rope, too worn to be safe for use on ships as cordage, would be unraveled into fibers which could be then tarred and/or greased and used for caulking. And it should not have been surprising that gathering a very large number of elderly or infirm people under one roof , making them work in a badly-heated space and with poor food and sanitation,  spread disease. The death rate in work houses was high. 

I confess that I don't really know the attitude of all Dissenting sects to poor relief- what Presbyterians and Methodists thought about it. But there would be Quaker businessmen , like Abraham Darby, George Cadbury and Joseph Rowntree, who would be very paternalistic with their workforce, who very much felt themselves to be responsible for the health and well-being of their employees. It's pretty safe to say that, whatever denomination Scrooge represents ( if any) , he would not have been thought a Quaker."
AskHistorians,"Why did FDR keep Truman out of the loop during WW2 knowing he was dying, and knowing Truman would likely need to replace him?","William Manchester's The Glory and the Dream explores this subject in some detail as part of an account of the U.S. from 1932-1972. 

He makes the case that it wasn't clear to FDR that his life was at risk, despite being diagnosed in 1937 with systolic hypertension and diastolic hypertension in 1941. His daughter Anna and personal secretary were alarmed in early 1944 when he'd fall asleep in mid-conversation or while signing his name. They told his physician, Dr. McIntire. He agreed that he should get a hospital checkup, but ""seemed intimidated at the very thought of confronting his imperious patient with anything so drastic."" 

When Anna spoke to her mother, Eleanor ordered him to go to Bethesda Naval Hospital for an exam, which he did on 3/44. A group of specialists observed him. Lt. Commander Howard Bruenn, a cardiology consultant, was shocked at his condition. The president was worn out, feverish and had bronchitis, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. ""He reported hypertension, heart disease and cardiac failure. His colleagues agreed."" 

He was told to get some rest at Hobcaw, a South Carolina plantation. He cut well back on smoking and drinking while sleeping 12 hours a night for maybe 3-4 weeks. He took digitalis, but didn't ask what it was for. 

From the book:

""Commander Bruenn or any of the other Bethesda physicians could have explained his condition to him, but no one in medical school had told them how to inform a President of the United States that he is gravely ill. Besides, they lacked rank, which in wartime was important. All the charts and diagrams were turned over to Admiral McIntire. The Bethesda staff assumed McIntire would tell Roosevelt. There is no evidence that he ever did, and the President's working hours after leaving South Carolina certainly weren't those of an invalid. He traveled fifty thousand miles that year, leading two wars and campaigning for reelection.""

AskHistorians,Did the confederacy ever have a realistic path to victory?,"I’ll answer your second question first because it is far easier to address; could the confederacy have ever reunited the nation as a slave country, even bringing slavery into the North?

In a word, no. The Union had the manpower and the resources on its side, and the few attempts by the Confederacy to invade the North (Antietam and Gettysburg) were complete and total disasters for the confederate forces. It was all the confederacy could do to hold onto the territory they had, launching a full scale conquest of the far more populous and prosperous North was out of the question. In any case, it was never a war aim of the confederates to conquer the North: they were set on secession, thus ridding themselves of those good for nothing northern abolitionists. In fact, one of the South’s chief complaints leading up to the civil war is their inability to force northerners to uphold the fugitive slave act and return enslaved people to their Southern owners. 

Your first question is a little harder, so let’s get into it.

Was the civil war a fool’s gamble? Not entirely, I’d say, though the Confederacy was a very clear underdog. The North’s advantages - in terms of industry and manpower - were formidable indeed. And this does not seem to have been entirely clear to many secessionists, who were convinced that they would simply whip the Yankees, and send them running back north. And, in the Eastern theater, this seemed to be the case at first. The Union army was soundly beaten and forced to come running home to Washington at the first Battle of Bull Run. Which leads to the reason that the South lasted as long as it did: Union leadership.

While much (and in my opinion far too much) has been made of the supposed military genius of Robert E Lee, the south’s military victories owe as much to Northern incompetence as southern tactics. Lincoln spent most of the first few years of the war frustratedly cycling through generals, desperate to find someone who would be aggressive enough to take the fight to the confederacy and competent enough to win it. First he went to George McClellan, a conservative Democrat who was known as Young Napoleon by his darlings in the press. Self centered and jealous, McClellan forced out his predecessor, the experienced General Winfield Scott. Now, while McClellan proved to be an exceedingly competent logistics officer - arguably among the best West Point had ever produced - Young Napoleon failed to live up to his name. He was cautious and timid, with a frustrated Lincoln urging him to attack the confederacy repeatedly. But McClellan continued to dither, and when he did attack, he often failed miserably, most notably during the Peninsular campaign. Lincoln would replace him with General John Pope, who failed again at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Lincoln turned back to George McClellan, only to replace him again with Ambros Burnside, who was then replaced with Joe Hooker, who was in turn replaced with George Meade. Adding to the problems was the fact that for the first year, the War Department was run by the incompetent and corrupt Secretary of War Simeon Cameron. Cameron was sacked and eventually replaced with the competent Edwin Stanton.

But the East is only one theater of war. Out West, it was a different story. Competent union generals such as, for example, Grant, his good friend William Tecumsah Sherman, and others like George Thomas repeatedly bloodied the confederates, who were soon pushed out of most of Tennessee. Admiral David Farragut soon captured the important confederate fortress of New Orleans. To put it bluntly, the Western confederate army were getting their shit kicked in. Eventually, Grant would come to command the Eastern Theater of war as well, and began to grind down Robert E Lee’s army. 

At this point, I hope you’re noticing a theme here. Though the Union army suffered from a leadership deficit at the start of the war, once incompetent men were forced out of power and replaced with people who could wield the union’s immense strength properly, confederate defeats began to follow. 

The Confederacy held out hope that foreign intervention- mainly from France and Britain - would save them. While not entirely impossible, this was a highly unlikely, and downright impossible after the emancipation proclamation was issued. War with America would have been an expensive, costly affair, and the Confederacy was highly unpopular with the largely anti-slavery British public. Once Lincoln made it clear the purpose of the war was to end slavery, it was politically impossible for the British government, and, by extension, the French, to intervene. The closest Britain came was the Trent affair, when the Union captured a British mail steamer with confederate diplomats aboard. The British Press was outraged by the seizure, but the Lincoln administration issued a formal apology and everyone agreed to let mattes lie. The best hope for the confederacy was to simply wear the Union down, and hope that, if enough blood was shed, Lincoln would lose reelection and be replaced by a candidate who would make peace with the confederacy - our old friend McClellan.

AskHistorians,Why did Hitler hate New Zealand?,"The simple answer is that he was not referring to white British settlers at all, but to the Māori. 

Hitler said:

> “For example: many New Zealanders live in trees and many still climb around on all fours, very different from a European, who walks on two legs and does not live in trees, but wanders the streets.

> “Now you might say: 'That is the effect of climate.' My friend, if all Europeans left the continent and the New Zealanders slipped in here, you will surely not believe that the climate will make a European out of a New Zealander.""

This is of course ridiculous nonsense, but it’s clear from the second paragraph that he’s *not* referring to British settlers, as his point implies that he doesn’t think they could be ‘turned into’ New Zealanders in the ethnic sense purely by living there - because, to him, race was fundamental. 

Today ‘New Zealanders’ refers to all people from the country, also including its white or ‘Pākehā’ population. And this was then largely true within the English speaking world too.

But even in English, ‘New Zealanders’ once referred to the Māori in an ethnic sense: as a particularly well known example, see R Maunsell’s 1842 ‘A Grammar of the New Zealand Language’, the first published Māori grammar primer. This was one year after the Treaty of Waitangi, when the British settler colony of New Zealand was first recognised (new enough that this was still within living memory when Hitler said the above). The usage was typical in books on anthropology and geography up to the early 20th century.

But even in 1925, when New Zealand was already upgraded from a ‘colony’ to a ‘Dominion’ (from 1907) and had long had a degree of self-government (from 1853), it did not yet have sovereignty for external affairs, but interacted militarily and diplomatically through the organs of the British Empire, and so Germans and other Europeans who had less contact with New Zealanders in general therefore typically still simply regarded white New Zealanders as ‘British’ - or even more often, to open another can of worms - ‘English’, and to them ‘New Zealanders’ still referred specifically to the Māori. New Zealand (named as it was after a region of the Netherlands), was far more recognisable a name to a German, and it was not yet common to make pains to use names more faithful to the original non-Western languages, a movement of sorts that took place in the decades after WW2, which Hitler was certainly not concerned with. 


Why did he say this, and single them out? Germany may have had less interaction with them (despite having recently had its own colonies in the Pacific, including in Samoa), but as one of the largest groups of Polynesians, and one with whom Europeans in general had had some of the most hostile contact, the Māori were relatively well known in Europe (just as, after the Anglo-Zulu war, the Zulu became one of the most well known African groups to Europe, America, etc.), and of course that relative fame came with a fairly one-sided narrative, with stories of ‘savages’ and the (in this case actual) ritual cannibalism painting a very negative picture. Hitler was of course quite happy to adopt that, with the almost comic ignorance and exaggeration shown in his speech.

I am not sure if Hitler was aware of the Māori Pioneer Battalion from WW1, though if he had been he’d have probably been aware they didn’t walk on all fours… But the Māori Battalion of WW2 and Māori pilots in the Royal New Zealand Air Force would later serve with distinction in Europe to help end *his* savagery, whatever he might have thought about them and how they’d fare in a European climate."

Near the end it features a series where space explorers move further and further away from earth, and because light takes time to travel, the explorers see [a series of scenes](https://youtu.be/9edow8V-66Y?t=4282) going progressively back further in time. It isn't quite clear how the explorers are outrunning light, but they seem to be using a fantasy ship much like Carl Sagan's in *Cosmos*, which is appropriate given the movie is essentially the 1920s version of *Cosmos*. (The film makers had, of course, just made a science film on relativity, so it is unlikely this was a ""mistake"".)

What the movie does _not_ include is the idea that leaving the Milky Way leads to other, entirely different galaxies. Even though 1925 is after Hubble's observation (where he found a variable star in a nebulae and was able to reckon the distance, verifying
that the ""island universe"" theory was true) it hadn't quite filtered down yet to mass communication in a general way -- also note that the film took over 2 years to make! This was in the period where the island universe was considered a viable theory and nobody had quite proved it yet. By 1927, though, Popular Science [had a glossy article](https://books.google.com/books?id=TSkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false):

>These stars, astronomers find, are not sprinkled at random in space, but grouped in countless separate universes. Our universe, the Milky Way, is one of them, and our sun, a huge ball a million miles in diameter is just one of a million stars in the swarm.

*Popular Science* had 350,000 subscribers in 1928. The German magazine *Kosmos* was selling 200,000 copies a month through the 1920s. *The Science of Life* (1929 by H. G. Wells, Julian Huxley and G. P. Wells) sold hundreds of thousands. (For comparison, *Time* by 1927 was considered influential and had roughly half the subscriber base of *Popular Science*.) The public in 1920s had a hunger for science -- they had, after all, seen the rise of the automobile, the airplane, and the terrible weapons of WW1, and wanted to know more -- but trying to gauge the public reaction to this specific scientific discovery is still a tough ask, as

a.) in general, historical people haven't collected ""reaction quotes"" the same way modern people do

b.) historians also generally haven't made it their focus so research on the area is light

c.) this is one of many discoveries at this time, science was fast moving, even if we just focus on astronomy, so it isn't like one particular moment would be thought of as epoch-making at the time

d.) there was enough lag time in the idea being popularized that it would be difficult to mark the moment when a particular person in ""the public"" knew about it

e.) the idea of island universes had been around for quite a long time already, and it was a subject of recent debate so _confirmation_ of what was already considered in the 18th century doesn't represent a sudden shift in reality that might get a reaction, even from astronomers who were close to the knowledge.

There _was_ a sudden shift in reality from Hubble's discovery, but it wasn't from the confirmation of island universes. Before we get to that, let's step back in our time machine of the mind to the 18th century--

...

Emanuel Swedenborg's ornately titled *The Principia Or, The First Principles of Natural Things, Being New Attempts Toward a Philosophical Explanation of the Elementary World* from 1734 is perhaps the first attempt at something like a ""island universe"" theory, although not in those terms.

>This very starry heaven, stupendous as it is, forms, perhaps, but a single sphere, of which our solar vortex constitutes only a part; for the universe is finited in the infinite. Possibly there may be other spheres without number similar to those we behold; so many indeed and so mighty, perhaps, that our own may be respectively only a point; for all the heavens, however many, however vast, yet being but finite, and consequently having their bounds, do not amount even to a point in comparison with the infinite.

This was essentially pure philosophizing, imagining the visible heavens as a ""single sphere"" in the sea of the infinite, akin to medieval cosmologists having arguments about ""is it possible for void to exist"" based on pure argument. (Nicole Oresme from the 14th century: ""...if two worlds existed, one outside the other, there would have to be a vacuum between them ... it is impossible that anything be void..."")

Thomas Wright in 1750 independently came up with the same concept, with more reference to evidence: ""...is in some Degree made evident by the many cloudy Spots, just perceivable by us, as far without our starry Regions, in which tho' visibly luminous Spaces, no one Star or particular constituent Body can possibly be distinguished; those in all likelihood may be external Creation, bordering upon the known one, too remote for even our Telescopes to reach."" He theorized the center to the universe has ""the Divine Presence or some corporeal agent full of all virtues"".

This was picked up by the philosopher Kant not long after (who directly referred to Wright, and while taking the general idea discarded the ""corporeal agent full of all virtues"" concept) and then finally the great astronomer Herschel, looking specifically at nebulae. Herschel did eventually (after some attempts to measure distance) settle on nebulae being within the Milky Way.

It wasn't until the mid-19th century another attempt at reviving the idea was tried, with [a picture](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Gordon/Figures/sourcem33plate11a.jpg) from the Earl of Rosse of Messier 33, leading to speculation from Alexander Stephen in [a 1852 issue of the *Astronomical Journal*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1852AJ......2...95A/abstract) that the “Milky Way and the stars within it together constitute a spiral with several (it may be four) branches""; this was shot down again with some misunderstandings of size.

More or less simultaneous to this the actual full term ""island universe"" was coined by astronomy popularizer Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel at Cincinnati College. Mitchel started a ""citizen science"" group in 1842 by offering for contributing (minimum $25) to building an observatory to be a founding member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society and be able to use the telescope. Unfortunately, Cincinnati College burned down only a few days after the telescope came, so Mitchel switched gears to become a traveling popular lecturer; he founded an astronomy publication he called *The Sidereal Messenger* that was, according to the first issue:

>...the first popular Astronomical periodical ever attempted (as far as we know) in any language...

He used the specific term ""island universe"" quite a few times, apparently for the first time (Von Humboldt used the term ""Weltinseln"" in 1850 which could have been translated that way, but it was translated instead as ""world islands"".) Even if the concept was restricted more to musings of philosophers in the 1700s, the mid-1800s had the idea brought to the public.

(Mitchel unfortunately did not outlive the Civil War -- he was called up as a Union General and while stationed in South Carolina he died of yellow fever.)"

AskHistorians,How was Trans Pacific laundry service economical in 1850's San Francisco?,"This is a great question with a fairly simple answer. It is a question I once asked the esteemed Bay Area archaeologist, Eugene Hattori after I hired him and brought him to my office in Nevada. Gene had worked a great deal with Gold Rush era sites. he is now serves as the Curator of Anthropology at the Nevada State Museum in Carson City. He was the first person to tell me about this odd practice of shipping laundry to China (and also to Hawaii) to be cleaned, and then returned.

How, indeed, could this possibly work?

The answer is shockingly simple. People (I'm sure almost all men), would exchange a dirty garment for a clean one, paying a laundering fee. One never received one's bit of clothing back; that simply entered the vast system of dirty clothes in; clean clothes picked up. It mattered little that one was wearing someone else's shirt as long as it was clean.

The laundry workers were able to make this profitable because of the scale and simplicity of the operation. In addition, ships going back and forth could transport any number of other things at the same time, making the trips worth while.

AskHistorians,How did Ptolemaic Egypt and the Carthaginian Empire secure the wood needed for their formidable navies?,"I can't answer about Carthage, but I can answer the Ptolemaic aspect of the question.

Egypt was definitely a lot greener than you're imagining and had plenty of wood, but it didn't have sufficient qualities of long timbers suitable for shipbuilding. During the dynastic period, the importation of tall conifers from regions like Lebanon was very important for this exact reason. The Ptolemaic dynasty was a maritime power, expending significant resources on building both massive quantities of ships and a few ships that were just massive. This meant that the Ptolemies had to extend their reach to areas that had the resources they needed. Cyprus, an important holding of the Ptolemaic kingdom, provided timber in some quantities. Another important wood-producing territory was Coele-Syria in the region of modern day Syria and (you guessed it!) Lebanon. Coele-Syria was heavily contested between the Ptolemies and Seleucids because of its resources and strategic importance.

Other regions in Cilicia, Syria, and Phoenicia provided timber in quantities to Egypt. The Levant was of course always an important exporter of wood. It's perhaps notable that even in later periods, Cleopatra took a personal interest in possessing groves in Jericho and that she also built hundreds of ships during her reign. Timber was also imported from East Africa and Arabia during the Ptolemaic period and earlier periods. However much of the timber imported through the Red Sea trade network were precious woods from India, Arabia and Africa, used for constructing luxury items not ships.

The need to import materials like wood and certain metals was a serious limiting factor for the Ptolemaic military and economy. When the Ptolemaic empire contracted, their fleet shrank due to the difficulties of sourcing sufficient materials. However, what they could field was still significant, drawing on what could be harvested from Cyprus and purchased from other regions."
AskHistorians,Why in North American history there are is more natives being killed/placed in reservations while South America there was more integration?,"The Conquest of the Americas was quite a diverse process, in terms of duration and ethnic variety. The Spanish arrived in the Caribbean in the 15th century and totally exterminated some of the peoples they encountered, such as the inhabitants of Cuba and Hispaniola. Other groups were integrated into the Spanish Empire following the feudal model that was common in Europe and to some extent familiar to the great agricultural civilizations of Mesoamerica and the Andes.

In Peru and Mexico the Spanish appeared as a disruptive military power. For example, in Mesoamerica there was a conflict between Tlaxcalans and Mexicas. Tlaxcala, initially waged war, signed an alliance whit the conquerors. Moctezuma, tlatoani of the triple alliance, tried to ally with the Spaniards, but their excessive demands led to a confrontation with the elite of the Mexica empire and the total conquest of Tenochtitlan.

After the great conquests of the 16th century, the Mexica and Inca empires were integrated into the Spanish Empire. Just as in the Iberian Peninsula the Kingdom of Castile and Aragon conquered and integrated the kingdoms of Andalusia and Granada. For the American nobility these arrangements were not strange, many had already accepted the vassalage in similar terms before, to the the Incas or Aztecs. Even accepting the imposition of new gods was common practice (although the Spanish obsession with denying all other religions was something new).

The English colonial process was different. It began more than a century later and was initially carried out by communities seeking a place to settle and self-govern, rather than territorial conquest. 

Although the English and French would later attempt conquest expeditions, they never encountered civilizations with a feudal organization like those previously conquered by the Spanish. This meant that North America never merge a complete kingdom within a European empire, as was the case in Central and South America. The English would achieve this later with the conquest of India.

Finally, in the 18th century, the industrial revolution, the theory of evolution and centuries of military superiority convinced Western Europeans that they were a superior race. Although ethnocentrism is common in all ages and societies, in this period it reached absurd levels. The idea that the white, civilized man had a mission to evangelize the world led to the planned and sustained practice of establishing colonies throughout the world. Coexistence with the indigenous people was no longer acceptable, they had to be controlled and civilized. Thus was born the system of reservarions, where a population is taken and confined in a territory under the control of the metropolis.

This process also occurred in South America, but Spanish American society was much more integrated. It was impossible to totally separate Americans from Europeans after centuries of miscegenation. However, racialist laws began to be enacted that gave special privileges to those who proved greater ""purity of Spanish blood"".

In conclusion, Spain absorbed entire empires along with their institutions. Although in the process these empires were totally changed, they remained sufficiently organized to maintain their organization even after independence. On the other hand, throughout the Americas the Europeans encountered decentralized societies that were either totally annihilated or were confined to the reservations."
AskHistorians,Do we know what Native Americans thought of dinosaur bones (if they saw any)?,"This is really similar to a question that I've answered before, so I'll repost it below!  However this doesn't deal with Native Americans *specifically* but rather, the approaches that were seen in many different cultures towards fossil remains.
___


So there is a common assumption that people found the fossils of ancient creatures and assumed them to be mythical figures.  This after all makes a certain amount of logical sense, and it is not hard to see how the remains of an animal such as an elephant in Greece could become construed as a cyclops or other mythical beast!  There are a number of popular stories around on the internet that follow through with this line of reasoning, often applying Chinese myths about dragons to the preponderance of ""dragon bones"" that were sold as cures for ailments with the rich fossil troves of China.  

Only.... this is not a particularly satisfying explanation.  There are a number of reasons for this, but I will let an actual paleontologist do the explaining here 

http://markwitton-com.blogspot.com/2021/03/dinosaur-fossils-and-chinese-dragons.html

the tl;dr is that there are some parts of China that may have used ancient mammalian fossils as bones, there's little indication this was widespread, or even common, and no evidence of dinosaurs being connected to Chinese dragon myths.

However this does beg the question, what *did* ancient people think of fossils?  This is a tricky proposition because ancient societies did not really have paleontology as a field of science.  Indeed the roots of paleontology as a science belong to the late 18th century in particular.  While there are some isolated instances of particularly common fossils such as ammonites which were believed to have been the remains of snakes.  There were even attempts to ""restore"" the look of these deceased and desiccated [serpents](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/content/dam/nhmwww/discover/ammonites-snakestones/snakestone-with-carved-head-close-up-baby-hero.jpg)  Given the prominence of ammonites in fossil deposits, and their relative ease of acquisition, its not unusual that they would feature prominently in pre-modern understandings of fossils, but that's due to a number of unique features that I'll discuss below.  

Before that intial period of paleontological interest though..... it gets murky.  Part of the issue is that actually recognizing bones as bones is not the easiest things to do.  We are used to seeing dinosaur and other fossils in museums as part of entire reconstructions.  But this is not how they are found.  Indeed, most dinosaur skeletons found in the field are *enormously* fragmentary, and getting 50% of a full skeleton is outrageously rare.  This applies even more so to many of the distinguishing features of many fossil species.  Skulls in particular tend to be quite delicate and easily destroyed over the millennia.  Indeed the most common surviving bones tend to be small fragments or teeth, and these are often not helpful in reconstructing a whole animal.  Indeed think back to some of the more [primitive](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Mantellodon_in_Crystal_Palace_Park.jpg/1280px-Mantellodon_in_Crystal_Palace_Park.jpg) renditions of dinosaurs that made them....well giant [lizards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Mantell%27s_Iguanodon_restoration.jpg)  That particular reconstruction dates to the mid 1820's, just at the beginning of paleontology as a distinct field.  Even by the 1830's though there was a recognition that these bones, especially marine species of the Mesozoic, did not have modern analogues in a traditional sense.  In part because of the excellent preservation biases of marine species in England, the Victorian period had relatively good ideas of what many old marines species looked like.....[roughly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Duria_Antiquior.jpg)

In short, unless you know what you're doing, it is rather tricky to actually find enough of an animal to fully reconstruct its life appearance.  Nor are they found willy nilly in every part of the world.  Fossils can only be found in rocks that are of a certain age and type, and these ancient formations are variously located and often in inhospitable locations.  Nor are fully formed fossils usually just sticking out of the rock to be found by any passerby.  Even ""complete"" skeletons are found over a wide area by dedicated teams working with modern science.  The possibility of some Medieval monk or Ancient Architect just stumbling across a whole skeleton is....implausible.  But an ammonite is slightly different admittedly.  Due to their small size and robust construction, and plentiful deposition, ammonite fossils are distributed world wide, however they were usually attributed to some local species such as rams' horns being shed, snakes, or other slightly curly creatures.  They were not understood as distinct species, but this is not really surprising.  To accurately describe fossils and reconstruct the animals that they once were takes a tremendous amount of learning that simply was not available to people throughout history.  Without understanding that species can go extinct, that the world is ancient, that animals back then were not the same as animals today.... that's a lot of things to actually know....

And even back then there was common recognition that these species were *old*.  The age of the Earth was poorly understood at this time, but even non-Bible thumpers like Charles Lyell were not quite sure of the *exact* age of the Earth, though a date of several millions of years was not considered implausible.  That these were once living creatures of a primordial world was well understood around scientific circles even in the beginning of paleontology.  However the fragmentary nature of most finds made exact reconstructions impossible, and the process of what dinosaurs and other fossil species actually looked like is still an ongoing process with new discoveries being made.  

You'll notice though that I am still staying in roughly the same time period.... and that's because we have precious little evidence that people before the early Victorian period really identified fossils as belonging to distinct entities that were ancient species.  This is for several reasons, not the least of which is the lack of quality preserved fossils and the lack of knowledge on how to construct them into plausible species.  A skill that eluded even many professional paleontologists of the time! (thinking of the time when one American paleontologist reconstructed a plesiosaur with its head on its tail....)  Usually they just associate them with some still extant species such as snakes, with the occasional mystical property added on (though this too is also not unusual for the time, medieval and early modern people had....odd ideas about the properties of various naturally occurring items and substances)."

AskHistorians,Why was The Grand Duchy of Lithuania only a Duchy despite it size? What would it take for it to have become a Kingdom?,"To repost an [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/esi3ig/comment/ffaer1c/) I wrote to a version of this question:

One thing to keep in mind is that ""Grand Duke"" is something of an imperfect translation of the actual title  in Lithuanian, which would be великий князь in Russian (or related variants of ""knyaz"" or ""knez"" in other Slavic languages...Polish is *Wielki Książe*). The title is something more literally translated as ""Great Prince"", and was the title held by rulers of territories in the Kievan Rus', and it's successor states, of which Lithuania claimed to be one (Muscovy was also ruled at the time by a ""Grand Duke"", that is, великий князь).

While we're talking about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it's worth recalling that in the period previous to full union with the Kingdom of Poland, the official court language in Lithuania was just as likely to be Old Slavonic or Ruthenian as Lithuanian, and as much or more of the territory's population in 1387 would be Slavic speakers and Orthodox Christians as Lithuanian pagans.

So why go with that term (which knyaz/knez and it's variations are distantly related to, by the way) over king or emperor? In short, those other terms were more closely associated with Western European/Latin conventions that mostly stopped at Poland. As mentioned, Mindaugas was in fact crowned King after converting to Christianity, but after Lithuanian rulers reverted to paganism it made little sense to claim pretensions to a Western Christian title that technically was bestowed by the Pope in Rome.

Similarly, emperor was not a very common term in Europe at the time, especially as it very clearly had connotations to Rome. Western Christians had one single Emperor until 1804, and that was the Holy Roman Emperor, crowned again by the Pope. Orthodox Christians had an Emperor in Constantinople until 1453, and for all of Lithuanian rulers' pretensions to regather Kievan Rus' under one knyaz, they weren't claiming to be the Third Rome - the Knyaz in Moscow would do that when assuming the title of tsar in 1547 (Peter the Great, that Westernizer, would just change the title to Emperor in 1721).

As an addendum: ""Grand Duke"" most likely came into usage as the English translation because Poland Lithuania used a Latin translation of didysis kunigaikstis to dux magnus, which would be literally ""Grand Duke""."

AskHistorians,"Why did Roman Emperors have so few children, especially sons?","/u/TheDreamNeverDies's response and subsequent comments give a comprehensive response to your question, but I figured I should just quickly correct some false assumptions you've made in your question.

Although its true that for a long time almost no emperors were succeeded by their biological sons, it's not true that they didn't have any biological sons.

* In the Julio-Claudians; Tiberius had a son and a grandson who survived to adulthood (Drusus and Tiberius Gemellus respectively). Claudius had a son who didn't make it to adulthood by modern standards but did function as heir (Britannicus).
* In the Flavians; Both Vespasian and Domitian had several sons, but Nerva siezed the throne in a palace coup before Domitians sons could claim power.
* In the Nerva-Antonines; Antoninus Pius actually had two biological sons (Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Aurelius. Not to be confused with the Marcus Aurelius he later adopted and would go to become emperor). However by the time old Antoninus took the throne both the biological Marcus Aureliuses were dead. Lucius Verus had 3 sons that all died in infancy/childhood. Marcus Aurelius (the famous one) also had 8 sons (and 6 daughters), however tragically by the time he was writing his meditations only 5 of his 14 children were still alive, and only one son.

So I guess the question is not exactly ""why did Roman Emperors have so few children, especially sons"", and more ""why did so few children of Roman Emperors outlive their fathers, especially sons"".

There are three reasons for this, if we discount Vitellius and Domitian (whose sons didn't inherit because they got couped):

1. Infant mortality in this period was very high, as evidenced by Marcus Aurelius' tragic experience. That Commodus survived to adulthood itself is a miracle, given the likelihood that his character should have brought a general to smother him in his sleep when no one was watching. Which brings us to the next reason,
2. Many relatives of the emperor had the habit of dying, often mysteriously, and sometime not-so mysteriously. For example, Tiberius's biological heir Drusus was assassinated by the Praetorian Prefect before he could take the throne. Then when Tiberius finally died, his grandson (Tiberius Gemellus) shockingly ""killed himself"" immediately after, paving the way for the adopted nephew Caligula to take the throne (boy did the powers that be get that call wrong). Claudius' biological son Britannicus suffered a similar fate. The favourite to inherit, we have coins minted during Claudius' reign with Britannicus' face on them. But when Claudius died, his fourth wife Agrippina seized power for Nero and Britannicus suddenly and mysteriously died, leaving no challengers to Nero as heir.
3. Bad Emperors had a habit of dying young, before they have the opportunity to have sons old enough to survive a coup. For example Caligula was assassinated before he had any sons (assuming they weren't erased from history), but he was also killed at age 28. Likewise Nero was overthrown and killed himself at age 30. Emperors that made it into their 60s, Hadrian and Trajan not withstanding, tended to have many children, they just didn't always make it into adulthood and those that did didn't always make it very far."
AskHistorians,How did the US drop the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki without getting caught/shot down?,"You asked a simple question? Well you gonna get a complex answer and like it.

Okay for real now. The simple answer is Air Supremacy.

At the beginning of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 japan sported modern and advanced air forces (yes plural). They had two... well actually zero true air forces since one was the aviation branch of the army, the other was the Naval Aviation under control of, you guessed it, the navy. Hardly atypical at the time, the US had a similar organization as well granted that the back then US Army Air Force was more ""free"" than its Japanese Army counterpart.

In any case the air forces japan sported at the beginning had been built over many years and had some of the most selective and hard training programs on the planet. This created excellent pilots... but not many of them. Compared to this the US had a less strict approach that still focused on quality but was much less selective. At the beginning you had very good japanese pilots flying very good planes against good allied pilots in good planes. The problems rised as the war went on. The japanese simply could not replace their losses and their training programs had to be completely revised and started producing extremely poor pilots due to constraints in time and resources. All of this while the allies had been increasing the number of trainees for years. Could affort to keep the experienced pilots as instructors rather than having them fly combat sorties untill death. And finally had enough fuel and planes to train their pilots very well. Plus their planes were getting better and better with more and more being produced. Finally the americans targeted islands to get closer and closer to japan with the final stepping stones being Iwo Jima and Okinawa. With bases there Allied fighters could fly directly over japan and ensure air superiority there. So by 1945 a japanese pilot was on average less skilled and flew a worse aircraft than its counterpart plusnote that even if on paper a late war japanese plane had very good charateristics things like poor fuel quality and maintenance hamper performance pretty hard so even good japanese planes were probably going to come up a bit short.

This is the enviroment in wich the nuclear bombings took place. The main base for the US strategic bombers attacking japan were the Marianas, in particular the B-29s equipped to drop nuclear weapons were based off the island of Tinian and were part of the 509th Composite Group. So the bases were rather far from japan but it was well within reach for the big american bombers while being a difficult target for the japanese. This meant a long flight. The bombings were to take place in full daylight as they wanted to have a clear image of the explosion and its effects for reference and assessment. The planes take off at night (2 AM for the Hiroshima mission and 4AM for the Nagasaki mission) and arrived on their target in the morning. The hiroshima mission landed back at around 3PM while the Nagasaki one had some issues and landed in Okinawa (in fact nagasaki wasn't even the main target but was the alternate objective in case dropping over the city of Kokura was not possible). So how did they do it with no reaction from the Japanese? Well the japanese had very little they could do about it. On the first mission the Japanese did not detect what they guessed was an air attack. Single flights of B-29s were fairly common performing photograpic reconnaissance. In fact the ""raids"" with nuclear bombs were generally made up of several B-29s mostly performing weather reconnaissance over the prospected targets and follow up reconnaissance for damage assessment. On the 6th of August when the B-29 approached Hiroshima nobody in the Japanese military suspected what was going to happen so the reports were generally written off as a simple reconnaissance mission. On the 9th of August things were a bit different. As i said their target was Kokura, for about an hour they tried to drop the bomb on the correct impact point but could not due to smoke caused by the bombing of a nearby city the day prior. The Japanese anti-aircraft artillery was firing at them and was progressively getting better firing solutions and apparently the Japanese recognized the pattern and attempted an intercept. Air Intercepts were rare because the Japanese had, as i said earlier, few pilots and lacked fuel so not every bomber was intercepted. The fact they sent up fighters probably meant that they feared this bomber was nuclear armed. For that reason the american commander decided to attack nagasaki and go home before the Japanese could intercept him. At this time radios were not encrypted and the americans could listen to japanese radios so they knew if fighters were being directed towards a target.

Yet the intercept fail probably not only because the B-29 decided to switch target and run home but because taking off and getting to altitude take time, so unless very early warning was given it was difficult for a japanese fighter to even get into a position for an attack.

I will add to this with an edited version of an older post on Hancock, that links to even more posts on Hancock.

____

There's a handful of fundamental scientific concepts that I teach at the start of any archaeology or biological anthropology classes.

The first is how to make a convincing scientific conclusion. SupposeI told you there was a teapot circling the sun somewhere between Earth's and Mars's orbits. It's too small to be seen by a telescope, and no records exist of anyone putting it there. Should I expect you to believe me? Are you a fool for not believing me? Of course not. Philosopher Bertrand Russell first used this analogy to support his own atheism, but it applies to any scientific statement. The burden of proof lies on the claimant, and you can't expect people to buy a hypothesis that states its own unverifiability.

The second is the importance of context: no data point is significant on its own. It says nothing about the effectiveness of a drug if everyone who takes it has reduced flu symptoms in 48 hours if everyone else with the flu has reduced symptoms over the same time. Likewise, no single artifact can tell us much about anything. Where was it found? What was it next to? Are there lots of similar things? How similar is it to those things? Scientific conclusions must be made in the context of an entire data set.

Graham Hancock's writings disregard these concepts entirely. This is why people use the word ""psuedoscience."" It's not because any of his claims are bonkers- ""bonkers"" is relative after all- it's because he doesn't actually do any science but attempts to make scientific sounding claims.

Hancock's first books (e.g. *Fingerprints of the Gods*) trick readers by violating that second point. I've offered an in-depth critique of his chapter on Tiwanaku [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/71gfmr/archaeologists_study_a_colossal_olmec_stone_head/dncgt8v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), which outlines the evasive, sneaky rhetorical techniques Hancock uses to convince readers. (And the lies. So many lies.) The basic formula is:

* Hancock describes something cool in vague, romanticized terms. This is often done in the first person in a journalistic style to provide an air of legitimacy without needing to be thorough

* Hancock asserts the thing's mysterious nature. He does this actively by showing how things archaeologists said 100 years ago (or never said at all!) fail to explain the thing, or passively by ignoring decades of research, positioning himself as the first person to ask these questions.

* Hancock offers an additional, enticing observation that, having had all other context stripped away, functions as the single knowable fact

* Hancock suggests his kooky hyper-diffusionist explanation for that observation that only makes sense if the handful of observations he's provided are the only ones you know

Because Hancock has stripped away all context for his observations, he can make whatever claims he wants. And because most readers have no familiarity with archaeological literature outside their high school history books, they don't know how much information Hancock is not telling them. Archaeological claims are like puzzles: they are built of hundreds of little interlocking bits that might not include every detail when but still point to a cohesive picture when taken together. Hancock is the dude in the corner yelling that the whole puzzle must be wrong because the two pieces he pulled out of the box don't fit together. Maybe if he looked at the big picture he might find a place to put them, but he doesn't want that; he just wants your attention.

More recently, Hancock has shifted to theories that violate that first scientific fundamental. His book *America Before* is the culmination of his obsession with the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. He also popularized the theory on Joe Rogan's show, which [I address here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4bjhyx/to_all_the_qualified_historians_how_accurate_are/d19zqs7/). The YDI was a supposed comet impact that caused drastic climactic changes and general environmental destruction at the end of the last Ice Age. Hancock had said for years that all his theories needed was a mechanism to destroy his ancient mega-civilizations. His first books claim that seismic activity buried a civilization under Antarctica. But once some evidence for the YDI as a cause for the Younger Dryas fluctuations was published, he quickly latched onto the idea, and suddenly this ancient progenitor civilization was in North America, buried under a comet.  *America Before* spends most of its time on how this event would have wiped clean ancient advanced civilizations in the Americas.

But here's the thing. We've known since the start of the 20th-century that there was some wacky climate stuff going on at the end of the Ice Age. We've also known that there was significant environmental disruption, including widespread forest fires and sea level change. The YDI is a theory to explain those observations. Why did Hancock not pick up on it before? In all likelihood, because a meteor impact sounds a lot more likely to have destroyed as much as Hancock needed to be destroyed than ""climate fluctuations.""

All Hancock's talk of ancient advanced civs whose evidence was destroyed by a meteor is classic Russell's teapot. He wants you to believe there was something there, but has embedded in his hypothesis a mechanism by which the evidence for that thing was destroyed.

Yet, this is another level beyond a teapot. A global civilization of the type Hancock speaks would have left *enormous* amounts of evidence. At the very least: mines and quarries, expanses of agriculture, tools and tools and tools, genetic evidence in domesticated species, and cities. This isn't just a teapot in space, it's a teapot that's blasting radio signals. Hancock must believe this entire civilization existed exclusively along the now-submerged coasts where the archaeological record is inaccessible or irreparably distorted.

I go on a much longer rant about the logic at play [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cb2od7/comment/ev76lnw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). To summarize that comment, Hancock loves to make a big deal out of disproving statements that were made with a fraction of the data we have now by asserting them as inherently true despite them being the result of inductive reasoning. ""People building monumental architecture used ceramics"" is, for instance, a claim arrived at in the early days of archaeology with a narrow survey of sites informed primarily by Eurocentric theory. It is not simply a common sense claim, and is as viable for critique as any other. Hancock would have you believe this ""obviously true"" statement is so enshrined in the way human societies work that any evidence against it as a radical revision of mainstream thought.
___

One can debate endlessly over whether Hancock's claims are provocative, ludicrous, nonsense, fun, dangerous, racist, novel, radical, dull, or any other number of adjectives. But that, I believe, is missing the point. If you're talking about the claims, Hancock has already won the best prize you could concede: a place on the stage of reasonable debate. His claims come from such a pathetic imitation of the scientific process that to evaluate them as statements of truth is pointless.

The more you look at Hancock's works, the more you see a guy doing their darnedest not really to argue that there was an Ancient Apocalypse, but to convince you that everything is mysterious, that archaeologists have never really done much research ever. He rarely discusses, rarely elaborates, rarely builds an argument; he jumps from ""there's an unexcavated building at this site"" to ""archaeologists are entirely wrong about the site"" without so much as a ""because."" His writing style is all about dropping a detail here and another there, moving on before you have time to question anything. The chapters in his book don't end with summaries, but with: ""I don’t know what to make of these similarities"" (that's an actual quote, he literally says that in *Magicians*). There is simply no attempt to use multiple lines of evidence, no attempt to point you to further reading outside things he himself wrote. Looking at the notes for the chapter on South America in *Magicians*, we see lots of self-citations, lots of travel blogs and news articles, lots of books he wrote the intro for, and lots of general audience texts from before 1960. He only cites the archaeologists he apparently has so much beef with in regards to a single throwaway line about the Amazon. 

This is particularly egregious if you watch his Joe Rogan appearances. Note just how much time he spends actually making falsifiable claims versus how much time he spends whining about establishment orthodoxy. And while you're at it, note how many times he calls out any specific archaeologists. He really doesn't, and one can only imagine it's because he either doesn't know them or he doesn't want you looking it up to find out how much information is actually out there. He keeps his enemies vague and ill-defined so you can't argue against him. If he can get you to buy into this all, it doesn't really matter what outrageous claim follows."
AskHistorians,"Is the “Qing conquest theory” that the Qing Dynasty destroyed the economic, scientific, and cultural progress of the Song and Ming dynasties true? Basically, did the Qing leadership lead to a “Chinese Dark Age” as some claim?","This is one of those cases where the answer can be quite short or quite complicated depending on how and how far you want to engage with the dimensions of the issue. I am most certainly not an economic historian, and my contact with the Great Divergence scholarship has generally been pretty tangential. However, there are interesting discussions to be had here about historiographical matters, and also about how Wikipedia editors can sometimes weave historiographical debates from whole cloth.

So, to get the economics side out of the way and to answer the question as phrased, the majority of Anglophone historians writing on the Great Divergence essentially reject the notion that the Qing conquest represented a permanent disruption to the Chinese economy or to its technological and scientific spheres. To quote just a few historians on this count who frankly understand the issues far better than I do:

> It is worth noting, for instance, that Chinese interest in the physical sciences and mathematics increased markedly in the seventeenth century, especially after the Manchu conquest in 1644-68, and that publishers found that medical books were a particularly good way to sell lots of books, fulfill a commitment to improve the world through their work, and steer clear of the post-conquest minefields of political controversy.

– Pomeranz, *The Great Divergence* (2000), p. 44

> After the economic decline initiated by the Ming rebellions followed by the disruptions caused by the Manchu invasion, the eighteenth century witnessed the resettlement of deserted land, the opening of new fields, and a renewed commercial expansion spanning even larger portions of the empire. Economic growth in the middle and upper Yangzi regions complemented growth in the lower Yangzi. Parts of North and Northwest China also increased production. The dynamics of Smithian expansion were present throughout.

– R Bin Wong, *China Transformed* (2001), p. 21

> The upheavals of the late Ming rebellions and the Manchu conquest hindered growth in most of the seventeenth century, so that by 1700 the population still did not exceed 160 million. Then in the course of the eighteenth century it more than doubled, from some 160 million in 1700 to 350 million in 1800 – an unprecedented gain of nearly 200 million people. Yet standards of living were apparently higher in the eighteenth century than they had been a century earlier. Sustaining such a massive population increase without a substantial decline in living standards implies a lifting of Malthusian constraints – something usually associated only with ""modern"" economic growth. Thus to dismiss the early and high Qing economic increase as ""merely"" extensive growth misstates an extraordinary achievement.

– Jack Goldstone, 'Efflorescences and Economic Growth in World History: Rethinking the ""Rise of the West"" and the Industrial Revolution' (2002), p. 351

What is *interesting*, however, is that much of this core Anglophone scholarship, suggesting that the underlying basis of the Qing economy remained decently strong through the eighteenth century, *pre*dates the spate of Chinese historians offering explanations for Qing economic weakness without necessarily providing firm evidence for that weakness actually being extant. The Wikipedia editors' inclusion of Kenneth Pomeranz's critique of what we might term the 'Qing Conquest Theory' is absolutely fascinating because at least one of the articles (Xu's) appears to be a response to Pomeranz, *not* the reverse. But in turn, there is little to suggest that the Anglophone historiography has felt the need to respond to this spate of Chinese-language scholarship, which appears to find roots in a particular strand of nativist and ethnic nationalist interpretations of Chinese history, wherein 'foreign conquest dynasties' like the Mongol Yuan and Manchu Qing are moralistically denigrated for their foreignness.

What the [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Qing_conquest_theory) of the Wikipedia article reveals is that this page's survival appears to have been largely contingent on a failure to successfully mobilise a strong front against its continued existence on the site, despite the page being marked as unreliable since August 2010. Both in 2010 (shortly after its creation) and in 2021, there have been extensive arguments over whether the article ought to exist at all, and even if it does, whether the title is misleading in asserting the existence of a particular theory under a term that appears to have been coined by the original author of the Wikipedia page, with no attestations in the Chinese or Anglophone scholarship cited. Per the 2021 discussion however, the term has leaked into some publications in the years since 2010, in a textbook case of what the webcomic xkcd termed ['citogenesis'](https://xkcd.com/978/) – a bad-faith or clueless user puts an unverified or even unverifiable fact up on the internet, which a later good-faith reader replicates in a more formal publication, which then gets cited retroactively to support the original claim.

So, the question of 'is the Qing conquest theory true' actually holds an unexpected double meaning – not just whether what it purports to claim is correct, but also whether there is such a thing as a 'Qing conquest theory'. Now, on that count, I would argue that *yes*, there *is* such a thing, insofar as one can point to a body of Chinese-language scholarship that does genuinely argue that the Qing conquest of China in the 1640s and subsequent Qing policy within China were a cause of economic and scientific stagnation or even decline, and one can coin a term to describe it. 'Qing conquest theory' would not be an unreasonable term to impose in that it does literally encompass what these historians argue.

The problematic aspect to this discussion is ultimately the way that this has entered the online space. A Wikipedian decided around 2010 that their characterisation of a body of Chinese scholarship was deserving of an article, and the end result was something that mostly replicated the arguments in those articles (especially Xu (2005), who is cited a whopping 12 times in an article with 42 total citations, except the link to the cited article is dead) without a full examination of how other scholars reacted to it – quite possibly because few specialists outside China *cared* about stuff that was mostly nationalist nonsense. What we now have is an article whose genesis lies with one particular person more than a decade ago, and which has essentially *never* been updated to discuss more modern scholarship – you will note that its bibliography includes nothing in Chinese more recent than 2010, and nothing in English more recent than 2007. It's not that we cannot speak of such a concept, but its current articulation on the internet is extremely problematic."

AskHistorians,"The Caliphate of Cordoba collapsed in 1031, but there presumably many Umayyad princes still about. So, where did all the Umayyads go? Do we have any record of them post-1031, or did they totally vanish from history's eyes?","While the lineages of the last few Umayyad caliphs in al-Andalus vanished into obscurity, there is at least one case of claimed descent from the Umayyads in Spain at a later date. In 1568, a gathering of crypto-Muslims ('Moriscos', those who had nominally accepted the forced conversion to Catholicism in 1502 but continued practicing in secret) acclaimed one Fernando de Válor as king of Granada, under his Muslim name of Aben Humeya (ibn Umayya). We have good reason to be suspicious of whether he really could trace his descent to the Umayyads, since the Nasrid dynasty of Granada had never used Umayyad ancestry as part of their genealogy. Even during what we call the Umayyad Caliphate of the West, the dynasty there actually called themselves the Banu Marwan (Marwanids, after the branch of the Umayyads who ruled as caliphs 684-750). Aben Humeya's rebellion was defeated by the Spanish forces in a few years despite support from North Africa.

There are quite a few accounts of descendants of the Umayyads of the east, some more plausible than others. The idea of a wholesale slaughter of the clan by the Abbasids is an exaggeration, as many members survived and some even worked as officials in the Abbasid state. The Marwanid lineage was the focus of the killings at Nahr Abi Futrus and other purges also discriminated based on relation to the Marwanids, power, and accessibility.

Upper Egypt was something of a Marwanid power base, and it's there that Marwan II retreated to in 749 CE during the war with the Abbasids. We have records of some Marwanids there being captured after the caliph's death and sent to Palestine for execution, but then later we find a Dihya bin Mu'assab bin al-Asbagh bin 'Abd al-Aziz who revolted against the Abbasids in 761 and 785 CE, the latter attempt ending in his execution. A judge who died in 864, al-Harith bin Miskin bin Marwan (thus the grandson of the caliph) was said to be proud of his Umayyad *nisba*. He was briefly imprisoned for refusing to make a demonstration of loyalty to the Abbasids and the Mu'tazili doctrine; he conceded and came out alive.

We can go even further forwards in time and still find plausible Umayyad descendants. Describing the tribes of Upper Egypt, the genealogist al-Hamdani informs us that many subgroups of the Umayyad clan survived in al-Ushmunayn, near modern Mallawi, Minya Governate. The Banu Shadi, a subgroup of the Bali who served as emirs of Akhmim (in the modern Sohag governate) were also said to be Umayyad descendants. These groups endured the Fatimid period and were still present during the Mamluk sultanate.

There are also claims to Umayyad ancestry among rulers from the Sudan. It's sensible to take a cautious approach to these claims, since many genealogical traditions were assembled under the authority of servants of local kings who wished to connect themselves to the wider Islamicate and provide themselves with an ancestry that would legitimise them among their Muslim subjects.

Sultan 'Umara Dunqas of the Funj Sultanate hired a genealogist named al-Imam al-Samarqandi in the early 16th century CE whose work is likely the basis for all claims of Umayyad descent in the Sudan, and he was working for a king who felt endangered by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I and was trying to avoid an invasion. The genealogist may have been inspired by the story of 'Abdallah and 'Ubaydallah, reported by al-Mas'udi in the 10th century CE and repeated by al-Ashraf 'Umar and ibn Khaldun in the 13th and 14th centuries. According to these accounts, two sons of Marwan II named 'Abdallah and 'Ubaydallah escaped after their father was killed at Busir. They fled to Aswan and then kept going south, entering the lands of the Beja peoples. 'Ubaydallah died during the journey but 'Abdallah reached the Red Sea and crossed to Jeddah, where he managed to escape detection for a few years before being arrested and imprisoned for decades, only being released as a very old man. Despite the fact that 'Abdallah only travels through the Sudan on his way to the Hejaz, it may have been enough of a basis for the genealogy.

AskHistorians,"In the Gallic wars, Julius Caesar mentions that Gauls have very prolific iron mines, and he praises how clever their mining devices are, but he never describes them. Do we know what these devices were?","Could you give what passage you had in mind? With a quick research and I could only find one passage mentionning the Gauls Iron mines from C. Julius Caesar

>Singulari militum nostrorum virtuti consilia cuiusque modi Gallorum occurrebant, ut est summae genus sollertiae atque ad omnia imitanda et efficienda, quae ab quoque traduntur, aptissimum.  
>  
>Nam et laqueis falces avertebant, quas, cum destinaverant, tormentis introrsus reducebant, et aggerem cuniculis subtrahebant, eo scientius quod apud eos magnae sunt ferrariae atque omne genus cuniculorum notum atque usitatum est.  
>  
>Totum autem murum ex omni parte turribus contabulaverant atque has coriis intexerant.  
>  
>Tum crebris diurnis nocturnisque eruptionibus aut aggeri ignem inferebant aut milites occupatos in opere adoriebantur, et nostrarum turrium altitudinem, quantum has cotidianus agger expresserat  
>  
>commissis suarum turrium malis adaequabant, et apertos cuniculos praeusta et praeacuta materia et pice fervefacta et maximi ponderis saxis morabantur moenibusque appropinquare prohibebant.  
>  
>( *C. Julius Caesar, De bello Gallico,* 7.22)

This passage translates in modern english to

""*To the extraordinary valor of our soldiers, devices of every sort were opposed by the Gauls; since they are a nation of consummate ingenuity, and most skillful in imitating and making those things which are imparted by any one; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses, and when they had caught hold of them firmly, drew them on by means of engines, and undermined the mound the more skillfully on this account,* ***because there are in their territories extensive iron mines, and consequently every description of mining operations is known and practiced by them.*** *They had furnished, more over, the whole wall on every side with turrets, and had covered them with skins. Besides, in their frequent sallies by day and night, they attempted either to set fire to the mound, or attack our soldiers when engaged in the works; and, moreover, by splicing the upright timbers of their own towers, they equaled the height of ours, as fast as the mound had daily raised them, and countermined our mines, and impeded the working of them by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends, and boiling pitch and stones of very great weight, and prevented them from approaching the walls.*""

&#x200B;

Calling this passage a praise would be a stretch. Also the problem with taking Caeasar *De Bello Gallico* at its word that it is not an impartial judgment of the Gallic people and their skills. You see there was every incentive for Caesar to make the Gauls ressourceful, brave and worthy opponents to the Roman in his writing. To sell the just cause of his wars to the Roman people and the Senate. It is politically driven. Caesar is definitely encouraged to portray the Gauls in a way that they can be a grandiose threath to Rome so he constantly praises their warriors and bravery.

&#x200B;

As to what types of mining and mining devices existed in the Roman world it can be divided in between three broad categories according to Pliny the Elder (Plin. Nat. 33.21).

1. The Mining of Metal found above ground. That which is usually in river beds. This type would require no digging and rely mostly on panning or filtering the flow of water. (Think of the miners during the great gold strikes of the 19th century for a rough image of what it would have looked like).
2. Shaft mining of metal found underground. A vertical sharft would be dug to the level where the metal or ore would be located. A gallery would then be created at the bottom of the shaft and the ore would be extracted and processed through metallurgy.
3. Deep vein mining where horizontal tunnels would be dug to follow horizontal veins and a complex network tunnels connecting many galleries would be created. Workers in those mines had to work extremely hard and in terrible conditions. They could set a fire inside the tunnel to weaken the rock before breaking it. The tunnel could crumble and  miners could die from asphyxia if it was not done correctly. Pliny also mentions choking from underground vapors, cave-ins, floods and landslides and I can guarantee there is no OSHA to help you.

So for Pliny only the first method was correct. He had lets call an environmentalist approach to ressourcces consumption. The earth yields ressources in quantities that humans should accomodate themselves with and doing anything more to gain wealth like digging into it is simple greed. He also disliked Iron heavily attributing it much of the evil of mankind. (Weapons are a woe on humanity)

As to the most ingenious mining technology the Gauls could have copied from the Romans its Hydraulic mining. Aqueducts were built to conduct water over to very large tanks above the deposit. The surface of the deposit was cleared of vegetation and then the gates of the tanks were opened to erode the deposit. If the deposit was a hard conglomerate you would break it up by making galleries through which the water would be channeled. The aqueducts would also power machines such as stamp-mills and trip hammers to break down the ore when necesary. Water wheels could also be used to saw stone. Aside from that miners would use tools such as stone hammers  wedges and pointed iron bars (But no protective gear!)

Today there are few archeaological signs of ancient mines but the Dolaucothi Gold mines would be a good representation of what a Roman mine would have looked like and its setup. There is a also an interesting experimental archaeology project in a landscape known as the [Karth](https://stremke-archaeology.net/goldbergbau_en/index.html) that tests the efficiency of the Roman Gold mining methods and focuses highly on the technical and geological part of mining.

AskHistorians,Did the Spartan stand at Thermopylae actually change anything?,"Since the allied Greek strategy was to actually hold the Persians at Thermopylae, the outcome of the battle itself was a complete Persian victory in terms of strategy.  

After destroying the Greek rear guard at Thermopylae, the Persians were able to conquer Attica and demolish Athens without much in the way of opposition.  Being denied that objective for a mere two or three days cannot be called a Persian defeat by any measurement.

Nevertheless, there are two or three major outcomes of the battle itself that, while they cannot be called glorious victories for the Greeks, were at least important for the later victory of the Greeks.

First, the stand at Thermopylae provided the Greeks with a proven credible strategy for dealing with the Persians when they approached the Peloponnese.  

This led to them confidently fortifying the choke point at the Isthmus of Corinth and also demonstrated that the Greeks had sufficient naval forces to block the Persian fleet from bypassing it.  

This confidence in the ability to at least temporarily stop the Persians by land and sea opened up new options for the Greeks, and would likely have lent credibility to the eventual winning strategy of attacking and destroying the Persian fleet at Salamis and thus forcing the Persians to voluntarily retreat back on their supply lines to prevent them from being cut off by a naval attack on the Hellespont bridges.

Second, while the stand of the Three Hundred (and the Thespians) was not a major blow to the invasion timetable of the Persians, the stand did allow the balance of the Greek forces to disengage successfully from the battle, to be employed elsewhere.

From a military standpoint, the difference between a reverse and a strategic defeat is often whether you can preserve the better part of your army in a condition to be able to continue to fight after the battle.  

If the Persians had forced the Greeks to remain committed to the battle at Thermopylae and unable to disengage, the Persians might have been able to destroy them there, or at the very least, be able to catch up with the retreating Greek forces before they could reorganize.

So, while the extra two or three days would not thwarted the Persian strategy, it did allow the Greek army to remain intact when it might have been destroyed or otherwise disorganized.

Finally, there is the real, but intangible effect of the stand itself.  It showed that the Greeks could stand against the Persians and put up a serious resistance, in spite of the advantages that the Persians had with their large and experienced land forces.  

This sort of morale boost is hard to quantify in any exact terms, but it is clear that morale plays a very large part in any campaign, particularly when your troops may be unclear as to how they match up against their opponents on a man to man, or unit to unit basis.  

In other words, there is no better way to keep a soldier from panicking than for them to know that they can engage with the enemy, put up a credible opposition and then survive, even if vastly outnumbered.

Therefore, to answer your question, I would argue that the one or two days did have a tangible impact on the later campaign and the fortunes of the Greeks, but not because the Persians themselves were checked or overawed by the last stand.  

The impact was instead on the ability of the Greeks to be able to recover from their strategic defeat and remain capable of resisting which ultimately allowed the Greeks to find a strategy that would work against the Persians."
AskHistorians,Did the ancient Greeks consider the Romans as 'barbarians'?,"It's complicated.

Because Greek and Roman literature has been better preserved and studied than the writing of most other ancient cultures, we know more about how Romans and Greeks thought about one another than any other two societies in the ancient Mediterranean. Looking through this literature, we find that there is no single answer.

**Greeks on Romans**

The original meaning of *barbaros* was ""a person who did not speak Greek,"" but by the time Greeks were interacting with Romans on any regular basis, the term had acquired definite moral connotations. For a Greek to call the Romans barbarians implied that the Romans were culturally, intellectually, and morally inferior. Some Greeks did indeed hold such a view of Rome, but not all did.

Early Greeks tended to have a positive view of the Romans. Heracleides Ponticus, a Greek writer in the fourth century BCE, reportedly called Rome a Greek city, but his original text does not survive. ([Plutarch, ""Life of Camillus"" 22.2](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Cam.+22.2&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0012)) Timaeus, a Sicilian Greek historian writing in the third century BCE, is the first Greek known to have written extensively about Rome, but only fragments of his work survive. He was well regarded by later Romans, however, which suggests he took a favorable view of them. ([see Cicero, On Oratory 2.14](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.+de+Orat.+2.58&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0120)) The earliest Greek source dealing with Rome to survive intact is a poem of praise written by the poet Melinno in the second century BCE:

>Hail, Rome, daughter of Ares,  
>  
>golden-belted warlike queen,  
>  
>you whose earthly home is Olympus  
>  
>the eternally unshattered.  
>  
>Ancient Fate gave to you alone  
>  
>the unbroken glory of royal command,  
>  
>so that the strength to rule  
>

These early positive attitudes mostly come from the time before Rome had conquered mainland Greece. During the last couple of centuries BCE, as Rome expanded its empire into the eastern Mediterranean, Greek views of Romans tended more to the negative. The historian Polybius, who had extensive personal knowledge of Rome, reflects these negative views in a number of speeches he reports in which Greeks called the Romans barbarians. ([Polybius, Roman History 5.104](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+5.104&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234), [9.37-39](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+9.37&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234), [11.4-6](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+11.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234)) While Polybius did not give his own verdict on the Romans himself, he did describe some of their habits that he found distasteful and un-Greek. ([Polybius 1.37](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+1.37&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234), [10.15](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+10.15&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234), [12.4](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+12.4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234))

Later, as stability returned to the Mediterranean under the Roman Empire, Greeks became more accepting of the Romans again. Later Greeks, like the scholar Plutarch and the orator Aelius Aristides, praised Rome and Greece alike, while still subtly maintaining that the Greeks had the better claim to true civilization and the Romans were only ""junior partners.""

There were also other approaches to the problem. Some Greek writers placed the Romans in a middle position, neither Greek nor barbarian, or in transition between the two. The geographer Strabo suggested this in how he described peoples of southern Italy:

>Nowadays \[the Greek cities of Italy\] have all become thoroughly barbarian, except for Tarentum, Rhegium, and Naples. The Lucanians and Bruttii hold some of the land and the Campanians other parts, but these are only names and it is really the Romans who occupy the country, for these peoples have themselves become Romans. ([Strabo, Geography 6.1.2](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D2))

The medical writer Galen described his Roman audience as ""those who are born barbarians but cultivate the ways of Greeks."" (Galen, *On the Preservation of Health* 1.10)

As with all ancient literature, we should not assume that these citations reflect a cohesive or universal attitude. These are simply the passages that happen to have been preserved, but even these show how widely Greek opinions on the Romans could vary."
AskHistorians,What lost literary work has tantalized historians with its surviving fragments?,"Speaking for my own field (Macedonian/Hellenistic History), the *Historia Philippica* by Pompeius Trogus. The author was a Gallo-Roman historiographer living around the turn of the millennium, and as such a contemporary of Augustus. He wrote an extensive universal history, with a focus on the Eastern Mediterranean, specifically Greece and Macedon, which would have covered the entire Hellenistic Age (commonly dated 323-30 BC). As our historiographical sources on that period are sparse compared to what came before or after, Trogus would have given us a plethora of valuable insights; the *[prologi](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/justinus_08_prologi.htm)* (book headers) of his work have survived, and tease modern historians with plenty of information that has sadly been lost, such as entire interregnal conflicts that so far have not seen any historiographical description (such as Antigonos Doson's Carian expedition) as well as (although certainly tendencious) descriptions of the inner workings of entire kingdoms (such as the Arsacid Parthians).

What makes Trogus go from interesting into tantalizing is that a variant of his works *does* survive - the *Epitome* by Justin, a hard to place figure who has been sorted by modern historians into any period between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE. The problem with Justin is that he doesn't really seem to care about the chronology, the causality, or the details of what he is summarizing - his interests lie in salacious and interesting details (such as Parthian polygamy) that are yanked from their context and highly moralized. Certainly some of that moralizing was already present in Trogus' original work (a teleological tendency of describing the failings of the pre-Roman Eastern Mediterranean and celebrating the Pax Augusta can be read into what fragments survive) but Justin ditches whatever historiographical approach Trogus may have had, and thus muddles the water for the modern reader. This results in a work that is estimated to be only one-fifth of the size of Trogus' original historiography - which sadly remains, to this day, tantalizingly lost."

AskHistorians,"Back when people did not have indoor plumbing, and relied on outhouses for human waste and wells for ground water, how did they keep their drinking water safe?","Proximity. Speaking only for the Medievals, they did understand that separating wastewater from good water is important. Taking the case of Medieval London, the 'necessary houses' (public toilets) were either along the city wall or the Thames. Those on the wall drained the effluent into the moat, or the Walbrook stream.

City laws also ruled the placement of cesspits in London. Unlined cesspits must be at least 3 and a half feet away from the property line, while stone-lined cesspits are allowed from 2 and a half feet away from the line. Complaints about cesspit placement were frequent, however. Some latrines could also get elaborate. Some were lined with barrel staves, others with stone; still others had a pipe to convey waste to a more distant cesspit.

Alternatively, they'd draw their water from elsewhere. Medieval aqueducts drew from springs some distance from the town, which would be much less likely to have any cesspits nearby. [I have a post with more on aqueducts](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mnlf9n/when_the_romans_left_england_and_left_behind/gtyhsly/).

Alternatively alternatively, they'd use rainwater. While the Medievals did not have germ theory, they did have an understanding of cleanliness and contamination. Multiple sources from multiple places and multiple times caution about using stagnant water, still water, or otherwise water that does not flow freely. Rainwater, being by definition none of the above, places high in many rankings of water from the ancient to the Medieval. Rainwater can be collected by the simple expedient of a bucket or barrel, or you can do more elaborate arrangements. Solid roofs and pavements can be connected by gutters to a cistern (if you have the money for all of the above, of course) and thus collect rainwater thereby.

Of course, sometimes the answer is simply ""they didn't"". Elena Gubbe in 1324 and a nine-year-old named Mary in 1340 both drowned in the Thames while drawing water in the evening. The *Thames*, of all rivers. (Though it is possible they were upriver of the worst contamination - who knows.)"
AskHistorians,How was the song YMCA by the Village People received by the YMCA and its stakeholder and allies at the time?,"Something I wrote on this sub 5 years ago for a similar question:

In a [2008 oral history of 'YMCA' in Spin magazine](http://www.spin.com/2008/05/ymca-oral-history/), members of the Village People and one of their producers, Henri Belolo, explain the genesis of the song. According to David Hodo (the construction worker in the Village People): 

>	It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, “What is this YMCA, anyway? “And after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn’t have any money — you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, “Yeah, but don’t bend over in the showers. “And Jacques, bless his heart, said, “I will write a song about this!”

The Jacques mentioned by Hodo is Jacques Morali, a French producer who was the (co-)writer and producer of all of the Village People's biggest hits; Morali was gay, and sadly passed away in 1991 from AIDS. 

In the group itself, there was a mix of sexualities in the Village People, with some members identifying as straight, some being ambiguous in print about it, and some identifying as gay. For instance, another member of the Village People - Victor Willis, the lead singer of 'YMCA'  is notable for being quite insistent that he is heterosexual; he married the actress who played Clair Huxtable on the *Cosby Show*. Willis has a co-write on the song, and Randy Jones (the cowboy in the Village People) says in the Spin oral history that: 

>It was not intended as a gay anthem. Do you have the lyrics in front of you? There’s nothing gay about them. I think Victor wrote the words, but it’s all a big fucking mystery. The guy who really deserves the credit is Horace Ott, who arranged the horns and strings. Jacques had the ideas, but Horace transformed them into songs.

In contrast, Hodo says in the same article that : 

>“Y.M.C.A.” certainly has a gay origin. That’s what Jacques was thinking when he wrote it, because our first album [1977’s Village People] was possibly the gayest album ever. I mean, look at us. We were a gay group. So was the song written to celebrate gay men at the YMCA? Yes. Absolutely. And gay people love it.

According to a [2013 analysis of the song and the relationship between the YMCA and 1970s gay culture in *The Believer* by Nicole Pasulka](http://www.believermag.com/issues/201307/?read=article_pasulka): 

>At the Y, a spiritual man was a well-built, muscular man. The organization’s leadership positioned the regional branches as destinations that could protect newcomers from “negative” influences. It was here that many young guys had their first homosexual experiences. So Jacques Morali and Randy Jones were part of a history that included both diligent Christian bodybuilders and men cruising for “trade”—straight-identified, masculine men. 

Pasulka and the Spin oral history both portray the YMCA as a place with an official anti-homosexuality policy, but a culture where homosexuality was often common. Pasulka also portrays the YMCA culture as becoming less gay towards the end of the 1970s, and becoming closer to mainstream culture, comparing it to the Village People's acceptance by the mainstream. 

By all accounts, in a world where much of gay culture was very underground, the fairly obvious gay subtext of the Village People to modern viewers was less obvious at the time to the mainstream - there wasn't much public knowledge about what Pasulka calls 'clone culture'; gay stereotypes at the time were very feminised. In contrast to the feminised stereotype, the Village People cast a knowing look at heterosexual masculine stereotypes with their choice of dress - cowboys, construction workers, etc - and the knowing look was missed by a lot of the mainstream at the time. This meant that the Village People could deny the gay subtext was there when they felt it was appropriate - and for Victor Willis who may have written some or all of the lyrics, there really might have been no gay subtext.

According to contemporary reports, the YMCA floated suing the Village People for defamation because of the implications of homosexuality, but didn't go through it - in the context of 'clone culture' etc, and Willis's denials of homosexuality it would have been quite awkward to prove. In contrast, the YMCA is now more relaxed about the gay overtones; their media relations manager said to Spin in 2008 that ""We at the YMCA celebrate the song. It’s a positive statement about the YMCA and what we offer to people all around the world.""

As to the long term impact, in the 1990s, according to the Spin oral history, the song began to be used in sports settings in America, encouraged by team managers and the like who thought the song would be a crowd pleaser. According to, for instance, the director of stadium operations at the Brevard County Manatees: 

>There are a handful of songs that just make you get up and dance. At our ballpark, “Y.M.C.A.” has to be considered one of them. “Y.M.C.A.” is a gay song? Honestly, I had no clue."
AskHistorians,"Back when telephone operators would manually connect calls, would they regularly exercise personal judgment in disconnecting or refusing to connect calls (to prevent harassment, embarrassment, or criminal activity)?","Credentials: I am a historical expert in telephone switching and practices related to that. 

There was no precedent for operators themselves exercising judgement on whether or not to allow a call to be completed. If an operator suspected that something bad was going on, they would be compelled to involve their supervisor, who would make the final decision. 

Operators themselves, especially in larger cities, were a mechanized service, and they weren’t expected to exercise judgement over what calls were connected and which were not. The job was highly regimented, and decision making was not a part of their job. (Other then decisions about how to set up the route for the call, which itself was a flowchart-like process.)

If an emergency occurred, such as fire, health emergencies, and the like, a supervisor was called over and the call would eventually be routed to the authorities for resolution.

That being said, in smaller towns and villages that only had one operator in the back of the general store, the operator could listen in on calls, because there was nobody there to tell her not to. This has been recorded as having happened. 

As an interesting aside, operators were often among the last to leave during natural disasters. Many operators stayed at their switchboard during these events in order to render service when it was needed most."
AskHistorians,How common was it for royalty/noble families to have had their siblings as consorts or concubines?,"In the kingdoms of what today is Spain, that was not a thing, although there was one attempt in the 17th century.

King Philip IV sired an unknowable number of bastards, some of which he actually recognised as his children, like Fray Alonso Henríquez de Santo Tomás and Juan José de Austria. In the case of Henríquez, the physical resemblance was so absolutely striking that there was no point denying it. The interesting case is the other guy, Juan José.

Juan José de Austria was an illegitimate son king Philip IV had with the actress María Calderón, better known as La Calderona. The child was acknowledged by Philip, and raised as befitted a royal son, was granted different ranks, knighthood, and even was made a prince, though not actual prince heir. When he was put in charge of the navy, he was created Prince of the Sea so that he would outrank any admiral, even the hereditary ones like the Admiral of Castile and the Admiral of the Indies.

The guy grew ambitious after several military successes, and one day he went to the royal court of his father with a painting. Some say he painted it himself, some say he simply commissioned and presented it. The artwork show him as Jupiter, Margarita of Austria as Juno, and king Philip as Saturn blessing the union. 

Philip IV was so completely disgusted and enraged by the idea of Juan José marrying his half sister that he banished Juan José from Madrid forever."
AskHistorians,"Modern Australians celebrate Christmas, a midwinter festival, in their summer, using trappings of fake snow and fake pine trees. Are there other examples of 'climactic relics' in other cultures?","I can think of several obvious examples in Europe itself and by extension its colonial, mainly coming from religions.

Palm Sunday is the first that comes to mind. Jesus, Christian theology generally agrees, Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem on a Friday during the Jewish Passover (Good Friday) and was resurrected after three days (Easter Sunday). The Sunday *before* he was crucified, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey and was greeted by a crowd welcoming him with palm fronds and spreading their cloaks on the road. This is often called ""[Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumphal_entry_into_Jerusalem)"", and is in all four Gospels (Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, and John 12:12–19). I think Luke fails to mention the branches, and only John identifies them specifically palms, but it became tradition to decorate churches with palm fronds. These palms are burned and provide the ash for next year's Ash Wednesday, at least in Catholicism. Now, historically this wasn't always possible and sometimes other branches (like those of willows or yews, or olives or figs) were sometimes substituted, but the ideal was always palms because of the Gospel of John. Today, with global trading being easier, it's always palms as far as I know. 

Likewise, in Christianity, communion includes bread and wine (in Catholic and Orthodox churches, the priest gets wine and bread, while the congregation just gets bread—*edit* apparently this isn’t true for many Orthodox Churches and it was changed for Catholics at Vatican II, I’m a little behind the times. I should have said for more than five hundred years leading up to 1963, in Catholic churches, only priests drank the wine). Wine production is not possible in all Christian regions, but the communion always had to be wine (or grape juice), demanding at times long distant trade. Likewise, at least in Catholicism, the bread (typically in the form of a communion wafer) must be made of wheat. This became an issue in areas as Catholicism spread to areas where where wheat was not traditional, like in Southern China or more especially among indigenous communities in the New World where corn was widely available. 

Jews, likewise, have brought the fruits of the Levantine diet with them to diaspora. There are the [four species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_species) of the holiday of Sukkot — lulav (palm branch), hadas (myrtle), arava (willow) and etrog (citron) — which in medieval Europe required elaborate trade routes and preparation. There are the [five species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_species_of_grain) of grain that matzo can be made out of — wheat, barely, then some other things we're less sure of, probably something like emmer wheat, spelt, and oats, possibly rye or something else. Maybe just two types of wheat and three types of barley. But certainly not rice or corn or anything like that. 

One funny example of culture *not* climatically translating is that the seven species (of fruit acceptable for the Temple) are often used as measurements in the Talmud. You must eat matzo on passover. Well, matzo (today) is like a giant cracker, how much of it do you have to eat for it to count as you actually eating enough? Jewish tradition say you must eat two *k'zayit* worth. Well, Sephardic rabbis of the Middle East and Mediterranean basin knew that a *k'zayit* just means olive, so they're like great, eat two olives worth. Ashkenazi rabbis of Central and Eastern Europe knew that *k'zayit* meant olive, so they're like, oh great, how big is an olive? Eventually the consensus is that an olive is the same size as an egg, so you need to eat two eggs worth. Another thing is that on the holiday of Hanukkah, Jews law says you must light a certain number of lights each night of the holidays and publicly display them. Jewish law says it's preferable to use to oil, and specifically olive oil is best but you can use other sources like candles if oil isn't available. Now, again among the Ashkenazi Jews, it became traditional to use candles because where are you going to get olive oil from in medieval Lithuania? Now, it's become tradition among Ashkenazi Jews to use candles (and some decisors of Jewish law even hold that maybe candles are the same as oil or maybe even better—summary of the debate in a [footnote 1 here](https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kosher_Oil,_Wicks,_and_Candles_for_Chanuka)). As one last example of the opposite of what you're discussing, Jews law has rulings for many specific species, presumably all species that were common in the Middle East roughly 2000 years ago. Unfortunately, which species specific Hebrew names refer to has been lost over the years, for example. See [this Wikipedia page for a discussion about some of those cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_animals), I particularly like the section on birds, but I also like that most Jews do not eat locusts because they cannot identify which specific species are kosher but Yemenite Jews do (in theory at least) because they have maintained an apparently unbroken tradition of identifying which kinds of locusts are kosher (for more, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_locust))."
AskHistorians,How traditional is Mexican food?,"So this is a great question, but I want to address an implicit assumption being made first. 

What is traditional? 

When we apply 'traditional' to any cultural product we are assuming a couple of things 1) that there was a point in the past when X phenomenon was 'authentic' 2) that overtime some cultural products have changed from that 'authentic' past and are no longer authentic or traditional.

This is problematic because culture is always changing. Every cultural product, words, food, dress, etc. is always in flux. Some of those changes happen internally within the culture under study and some of those changes happen externally or are forced onto a culture (we often see this in cases of conquest and colonialism). Or even more complicated some might be brought by external actors and yet still incorporated by people within the culture (sometimes we call this hegemony, see Gramsci for some deep theory on that). More often than not there is a complex calculus involving forces within a culture and forces outside that shape the ways that cultural products change overtime. 

In this case, I will respond to the question with the understanding that by traditional you mean pre-Columbian (foodways that predate the arrival of Europeans and the cultural impostions of colonialism). 

So the short answer is that much of the foodways associated with Mexican cuisine draw heavily from pre-Columbian roots. The typical Mesoamerican diet ca. 1400 consisted of corn (eaten in a variety of ways, fresh, dried and soaked in lye (pozole), ground with some lye processing known as nixtamal (torillas, tamales, sopes, etc.)), beans of various types, and squash again of various types. Most main meals had some combination of these ingredients. They were flavored by lots of other foods like chilies, herbs (like epazote), sweeteners like honey or agave nectar. Most groups raised some animals domestically, namely fowl and small mammals including dogs. Hunting for wild fowl or larger game like deer was common, fish and seafood were common if available. Most protein did not come from animals but from the essential amino acids that are found in beans and corn (so long as it was processed with lye to release the lysine). 

Another aside, there is no such thing as a singular 'Mexican cuisine' even today. Part of Mexico's nation building process in the early 20th c. focused on highlighting Mexican-ness as being pluralistic and containing many regional variants. (I'll come back to this later). So for example, using corn tortillas or flour doesn't make a dish more or less Mexican. Regions in the center (Mexico City) to the south tended to favor corn while regions to the north shifted to flour. Neither is more authentic than the other when it comes to their presentation in modern Mexican cuisine, but more on that soon. 

So as you can see a lot of what I just described applies to most dishes that we would consider Mexican food. So the question is how did colonialism shape Mexican cuisines over time. First, it led to a larger share of animal protein in the diet. This happened for two reasons. 1) Europeans brought with them the large animal domesticates that produce lots of meat, cow, sheep, pigs so those meats became available. 2) Before refrigeration the main products produced for markets was not the animal meat but less perishable parts leather, wool, tallow, etc. This meant that there was an abundance of meat for Mexican markets which meant that Indigenous peoples began to incorporate more animal protein into their cuisine because it was readily available and inexpensive. 

Europeans also brought new grains, notably wheat, and some other items olive trees, grapes, etc. These entered the diet of Mesoamericans to a lesser degree because they didn't thrive as well as other Eurasian foodstuffs and it took far longer to get Indigenous people to grow them, if at all. 

What we see during the colonial period is a slow shift in diet with Eurasian goods slowly penetrating and being incorporated into Indigenous diets based on their availability and the willingness of Indigenous people to incorporate those items. 

We see the most 'fusion' in spaces where there was a lot of day to day interaction between Indigenous people, people of mixed ancestry, and Europeans and access to the whole range of Indigenous and European products. So for example, rural communities did have diverse populations including Europeans, Africans, Indigenous people and people of mixed ancestry, but they likely didn't have access to lots of Eurasian foodstuffs, unless they were being produced locally. Urban areas tended to have both a diverse population and access to markets that stocked a diversity of food stuffs. 

The quintessential 'Mexican' dish created in this context is mole. It has clear pre-Columbian origins with many of its ingredients, but it also uses some European items and was likely 'created' or at least popularized in contexts where you had Indigenous or *mestizo* cooks preparing food for Hispanic creoles. The apocryphal origins of mole poblano (meaning from Puebla) is that it was created in a convent's kitchen. 

Now, the speed of change was pretty slow. European foodways did not really penetrate Indigenous communities quickly, with the exception of the availability of animal protein. 

If we were to look at how food was being prepared in say 1890 vs how it was being prepared in 1590 we wouldn't have seen a great deal of change among the broad swath of Indigenous Mexicans of predominantly Indigenous ancestry. Elites and Hispanicized individuals would have gravitated to European styles, especially during the 19th c. As I mentioned above in some places, wheat had become the dominant grain and so its use for tortillas had come about naturally. 

In many ways some of the greatest changes to Mexican diet/cuisine came about in the 20th c. Wheat became even more common and available specifically commercially produced wheat products (such as BIMBO bread products). At the same time, the amount of time spent by women processing corn dropped dramatically. Up through the late 1800s most women spent 2-4 hours a day processing the corn needed to make the tortillas, sopes, huaraches, tamales, etc. eaten by their family. This involved soaking the dried corn in lye, grinding the corn on a petate, and then cooking the corn. The average Mexican ate 1/2 kilo (1 lbs) of corn a day. So you can imagine a family of 4-8 members this meant preparing several kilos of tortillas (or other corn products) every day! The shift to prepared cornmeal (nixtamal) and mechanically produced tortillas freed women from hours of labor every day. 

At the turn of the 20th c. pulque (agave beer) was far more popular than European beer) in fact the main shift to beer happened as Hispanicized Mexicans sought to portray European beer as modern and sanitary and pulque as antiquated and unsanitary. The XX brand is in fact a commemoration of the start of the 20th c. and an allusion to modernity. As you might guess, European beer won out in that marketing campaign, although pulque is making a comeback (and is awesome!). 

So in short, Mexican cuisine is a fusion forged from the colonial period, but in a lot of ways it has very strong continuities with pre-Columbian cuisine. I mentioned regionalism. In the wake of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1930s), there was an attempt to create a Mexican identity that could transcend the variation across the republic. A major feature of this new identity was a belief that Mexico was pluralistic (at least regional) and so Mexican-ness was not singular but rooted in regional expressions of 'traditional' Mexican culture. Here the emphasis on traditional looked back to the fusion that had come from the colonial period and could be seen across Mexico in regional variations in food, dress, language, etc. This means that flour gorditas are no less Mexican or traditional than mole poblano or puerco pibil. 

A great book that covers a lot of this is:

# Q: Did something like the Hunger Games take place in the Easter Islands?

*According to* [*this wikipedia article*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangata_manu) *Easter Islanders participated in a series of crazy, suicidal activities as a part of their Birdman Cult such as swimming through shark-infested waters to fetch eggs from a small island. Why were they doing that? Was it something to do with overpopulation?*

A: Easter Island's birdman cult was the most elaborate and visible manifestation of the late stage of the island's indigenous culture, apparently flourishing from some time in the first half of the eighteenth century until its abolition with the forced baptism of the islanders and their conversion to Catholicism in the 1860s. It was essentially a fertility ritual, but one that had significant implications for power structures on the island.

Though the central ceremony was not quite as suicidal as you imply, it certainly did involve young men competing for the honour of their chief and their tribe by scaling thousand-foot cliffs, surviving on a tiny island with almost no resources for up to a month until the annual migration of birds occurred, and two swims across a shark-infested channel between the islet of Motu Nui ([which looks like this](http://imgur.com/a/nFS6t)) and Easter Island itself. But the central purpose of the birdman cult was not to set the young men representing their tribes against each other in fratricidal combat in the style of the Hunger Games; rather its central element was a race between the tribes to see who could return to the island with the first laid, unbroken egg of the new season.

Visiting Europeans first encountered the birdman cult in the late 18th century, but much of the information we have about it comes from the work done by the British anthropologist Katherine Routledge around 1914-15. She was on Easter Island in time to interview a number of older Rapa Nui (the indigenous islanders) who had participated in the last stages of the cult. Her findings can now be integrated into the current consensus view of Easter Island's troubled history, as set out by Steven Fischer. Remember, this has to be extracted by marrying late oral histories to archaeological work and the observations of a small handful of very short term European visitors to the island – there is no such thing as a Rapa Nui historical chronicle or surviving written sources of any kind, with the exception of the extremely mysterious surviving examples of Easter Island's *rongorongo* script, a form of hieroglyphics that may or may not represent an actual language.

So to lightly sketch the background (and with a caution that the well-known Easter Island section of Jared Diamond's highly influential *Collapse* is – ahem – 'widely disputed' by the archaeologists and anthropologists who specialise in Rapa Nui culture), it's generally accepted that Easter Island was one of the last Pacific islands to be settled by Polynesians. The first colonists were descendants of Samoans who had sailed east and discovered the Marquesas (c. AD 300) and Pitcairn and Henderson (c.500). Easter Island was probably first reached and colonised sometime in the fifth or sixth centuries. The earliest reliable radiocarbon date from the island is AD 690, +/- 130 years.

At that time the island would have been densely forested and hence would have attracted significantly greater rainfall than it does today. There would have been several permanent streams and a diverse flora and fauna, including numerous bird species. The largest indigenous animal was probably a species of skink. Of course the colonists brought other plants and animals with them, among them taro, yam, bananas and chickens. Most significantly and most catastrophically, however, they introduced the rat, which ate large quantities of the soft nuts produced by the local trees, notably the Easter Island palm tree, and hence impacted on the new growth of young trees. [Current consensus](http://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2013/12/09/249728994/what-happened-on-easter-island-a-new-even-scarier-scenario) attributes the infamous deforestation of Easter Island, which Diamond comments so eloquently on, more to the island's rats than to human activity. Significant deforestation was certainly occurring by 1200 and the island was probably denuded of trees at some point between 1450 and 1640. After that, driftwood became ""the gift of the gods"" and the Rapa Nui word for ""timber"" came to mean the same as ""riches"" or ""weath"" - an association that does not occur in any other Polynesian language.

So long as there was wood on the island, the Rapa Nui were able to play their part in the extensive trading culture of the Pacific islanders. It is likely that the island did not become cut off and isolated until c.1500. The period of contact can be traced and delineated by comparing cultural and linguistic affinities across the Polynesian societies of the Pacific.

In this first phase, Easter Island society coalesced around three core groups, the *'ariki* (nobility), the *'tuhunga* (""experts"", including a priesthood) and  *'urumanu* – commoners. Villages sprung up across the island dominated by kin groups, each with a chief. There was also an hereditary paramount chief, the *'ariki mau*, who was considerd a living god and who appears to have wielded absolute power. For as long as resources on the island were fairly abundant, and ships could be built to allow fishing, Easter Island probably saw relatively little violence. The island's language has plenty of words for various warlike activities, but the archaeological evidence for large scale, sustained warfare in this early period is nil.

By c.1500 there were about 10 extended kinship groups on the island, grouped into two broad *hanau*, or confederations - one in the north and west, the other in the south and east of the island. People lived most of their lives outdoors, sleeping in very basic caves or huts that scarcely qualified as 'homes.' Each group claimed a common ancestor and the famous Easter Island *mo'ai*, or statues, are understood as part of an ancestor worshipping culture (ancestors were considered to be deities, but they were not ""gods"" in the western meaning of the term.) The main religious beliefs (which also matter for the birdman cult) revolved around the concepts of *mana*, a spiritual power possessed only by the elites, and *tapu*, the rituals that maintained and built *mana*and which, taken as a whole, codified life on Easter Island. *Mana* can be compared (roughly) to western concepts such as divine kingship, but there is no real western equivalent of *tapu*.

Construction of *mo'ai*, the famous statues, dominated life on the island from c.1100-c.1500. Each was an incarnation of the *mana* of an ancestor considered especially worthy of commemoration. The earliest European visitors to the island, among them Captain Cook, noted that the statues were venerated and were believed to possess great powers.

After about 1600, however, increasing competition for resources began a period of unrest on Easter Island. The combination of deforestation, and an associated increase in both aridity and the leaching of the island's soil via sheet erosion, plus the impact of the ""Little Ice Age"" after 1400, began to result in the breakdown of traditional society; construction of statues ceased. The earliest phases of the birdman cult can be dated to this period, and in general it's probably possible to see the cult as a replacement for ceremonies involving the *mo'ai*. Later European visitors (from the time of Cook onwards) reported that the Rapa Nui had toppled all the statues on the island, presumably in the course of wars, and presumably to destroy their *mana*. The standing statues we see on Easter Island today have been painstakingly re-erected and restored - none survived intact throughout this period.

Archeological evidence suggests that the earliest form of birdman cult probably dates to the 17th century or earlier and consisted of two rites of passage into adulthood called the *poki manu* and the *poki take*, which translate as 'Bird child' and (probably) 'White tern child' respectively. These rituals involved the seclusion of boys aged 13-15 on the offshore islet of Motu Nui for three months. Motu Nui was probably regarded as sacred at this stage because nesting birds had been hunted to extinction on Easter Island itself. They returned only to offshore islets where they were safer from human predation, and hunting them for their feathers and eggs thus became a much riskier undertaking - one best suited to mature, initiated men."
AskHistorians,Why did Nazi Germany ally with Imperial Japan when they had little in common in terms of political goals?,"The premises do not stand: If Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were sincere in their political propaganda and truly formed an alliance despite the differences, then we might ask this question. Yet such was not the nature of their rapprochement, which was always utilitarian, with the two powers making often shortsighted unilateral moves to maximise their own gains at the cost of the other.

Imperial Japan was not 'anti-White', at least not officially so. One should read Sven Saaler, Eri Hotta, or Sumio Hatano on the subject but in short: The Pan-Asian ideology and Racial Equality rhetoric more or less called for the removal of colonial powers (other than Japan, obviously) in Asia and equal rights for the Asians(mostly Japanese, obviously) in other regions of the world, which is not the same as outstraight anti-White. There were, of course, increasingly loud anti-Western or maybe even anti-White arguments throughout the 1930s, but Japan had nothing explicitly against cooperating with 'White' people. They do not perceive racial issue in this way. There was a large number of League supporters. And cooperations with 'Western' powers continued, even intensified, after Japan found herself stucked in China. Britain, for example, was a long time ally. When the Manchurian Crisis went out of control, Wakatsilo cabinet thought to regain the initiative from the increasingly hostile international society and radical militarists by inviting a mostly White commission headed by a British to investigate. One can even argue that despite that the Anglo-Japanese relation did not really sour until the Burma Road Crisis, a topic scholars like Ian Nish and Antony Best wrote extensively on.

Germany, similarly, had no issue cooperating with countries dominately populated by other 'races'. They had no issue fighting a propaganda duel with the British in the M. East on the Egyptian society. They had no issue working with the Iranian or Syrian groups. And of course, they had no issue working with, or abandoning, the Chinese when it suited their goal. I cannot claim to know the historiography on this well but lots of works are done on the espionage there or the relation between Nazis propaganda and the Anti-Jewish riots.

The Tripartite Pact very much reflects this utilitarianism. Nazis Germany and Imperial Japan were never 'allied' in any obligatory way until 11 December 1941 when a declaration was made that neither shall reach for a separate peace with the U.S. or U.K. Even then one can argue they were not truly committed to this idea in any way more than using it as a propaganda. Prior to that, barring in a defensive war, neither had any real military responsibility to the other and one can argue that neither of the two powers were committed to the other's cause in any way.

One of the most read book amongst students of the decision-making process in Japan before the Pacific War was Japan's Road to the Pacific War, composed in the 1960s in Japan through surviving files and extensive interviews. It's made perfectly clear that the Japanese were in no way planning to pay for the German dream and their diplomatic 'Rapprochement' with the Germans was but a way to position themselves in a rapidly changing world and press further on the U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. A means to their own end if you will. Nor were the Germans in any way sincere. Just two months after the Japanese managed to secure a Neutrality Pact with the Soviets, Germans, nominally an ally and at least a friendly power, declared war on the U.S.S.R., pushing it to the British side and caught the Japanese in a very awkward position.

These were not allies in the way the 'Allies' meant it. Other than the shared distaste against the world order then, that means the Anglo-French-US dominated colonial and economic order and rise of Communisiom in the North, they were too far apart and shared little interests. Even after 1941, there was little truely coordinated efforts amongst the Axis powers. Some naval operations, technical exchanges maybe, trading some rare resources, that's very much it. In comparison, one can read about the ABC or ABCD conferences between the allies in 1941 and see how the Allies were planning their war efforts amongst powers with vastly different interests. If they were truly allies working as one, they might find themselves in a far better position: By unilateral actions, by December 1941, they have pushed the United States, Britain and her Empire, the Soviet Union, China, and half of Europe into a single coalition, truly something remarkable.

As to the issue of China, China was too far away for Germany to take much advantage from. Britain, Japan, and U.S. had financial interests in China or 'informal empire' if you will, but not Germany. Japanese also wanted Chinese resources to boost their standing against the Soviet or the U.S., which the Germans could not do.

And honestly, with the Civil War going on and multiple foreign players fighting for influence, China was simply too fragmented to 'exploit'. The Japanese failed repeatedly to fully exploit the resources of China. Even the Chinese cannot exploit China. A disarmed Germany half a world away encircled by the Franco-Russian powers could hardly do better. 'Exploiting weak country' is not something simple. To extract wealth or gain influence requires very practical means; it is not something that can simply 'happen.'

AskHistorians,Why did the Mongols not advance further into Europe?,[removed]
AskHistorians,"Before cars, did people road rage and ride horses as recklessly as some people drive today?","The one story that immediately comes to mind is something that comes from a [followup comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jlhttu/grover_cleveland_was_accused_of_raping_a_maid/gatqsv0/) I made on a thread about Grover Cleveland a couple years back.

So Cleveland became the guardian of his future wife through tragedy; his law partner Oscar Folsom had died rather foolishly in July 1875, when he'd gone out drinking with another lawyer and then drove his buggy back to his place.

When he saw a streetcar at an intersection, Folsom decided to essentially gun it buggy style and pass it on the right in order to not to wait. Unfortunately for him, by doing so the rear wheel of the buggy hit a wagon parked on the street, Folsom took a flying head dive out which fractured his skull and paralyzed him from the neck down, and to add further injury to insult he got run over by his own wagon and died within an hour of the accident.

Despite his legal training, Folsom actually died intestate - without a will - and Cleveland was appointed as administrator. (As a side note, probate records are a godsend for research.) While the estate was sizeable (~$250,000), as /u/Captn_Oveur
[points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jlhttu/grover_cleveland_was_accused_of_raping_a_maid/garbnq0/), the Folsoms lived fairly modestly thereafter."
AskHistorians,Where do Romani think they are from traditionally?,"Yes the modern idea that us Romani people originate in India 1,000 years ago is fairly recent, first originating from European academics in the late 18th century due to comparisons drawn from Sanskrit-based languages in India and the language of the Roma [(Hancock 2010, 7-8)](https://eriac.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hancock-Ian-2009-Mind-the-Doors-The-Contribution-of-Linguistics.-in-Acton-T.-A.-Le-Bas-D.-eds.-All-Change-Romani-Studies-Through-Romani-Eyes-Papers-given-at-a-seminar-at-the-University-of-Greenwich-June.pdf). As for what us Romani people thought, there is historical record of Roma telling Europeans where we are from. For example, in 1422, Foroliviensis reported that Roma he met in Italy ‘said they were from India.’ Sebastian Munster in 1544 said that Roma he interviewed in Germany stated that their homeland was in Asia, along the Ganges or Indus rivers. Various European sources from as early as the 12th century to the 17th century mentioned Roma as a population originating from the Indian subcontinent (Hancock 2010, 7). 
 
Regarding our mythology, much of it wasn’t recorded prior to recent times due to the closed nature of our communities, however, folk stories that have been recorded by modern ethnographers show that there is not an overall agreement within our stories of our origin. For example, a common myth within our communities is that we originate in Egypt, whether this originated from Europeans confusing us for Egyptians or early Roma claiming to Europeans that we originate there, is still a matter of debate among historians. Another common myth is that we originate from a lost tribe of Israel, and this one is still common in certain Romani communities today, especially in Hungary and the United States. Roma from Romania, where I am from, also have different folk stories. Two of the most popular are titled “O Romano Them” (The Romani Country) and “O Kamipen” (The Love). The first states that we once had our very own country but, due to a drought we had to leave and migrate all over the world, after some time had passed we ended up forgetting where we came from. The latter states that when God was dividing the world up, we came late, and there was no more land left to give, so instead all we asked God for was his love, explaining why we don’t have a country.  The idea expressed in the former, that many Roma forgot where they came from is supported by Dr. Ian Hancock’s research, many Romani communities were unaware of their Indian origins when the modern hypotheses of our origin in India first started arising.

To answer your last question, as stated by Hancock, Roma have never felt tied to an idea of a homeland, very opposite to the case of Jewish people and Israel. A homeland is not something that has ever held great importance in our culture and our folk traditions. This could be an explanation as to why we have moved around so much, due to not being tied to a specific area of land and also due to the persecution we have endured in almost every land we have lived in. Most Roma today are proud of the fact that we originate in India and find it interesting, but are not interested in returning back or see it as their home. Interestingly, Hancock also notes that some Roma see our Indian origin as a European idea due to the fact that they lost their knowledge of our history along the way and had to find out from European academics. For further info, I would highly recommend checking out the scholarly article I referenced in this post. Hope this helps! :)"
AskHistorians,Why did The Rite of Spring infuriate its audience so much on the first performance?,"I wrote a [little bit about the ""riot"" here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m6hfmd/in_1913_stravinskys_ballet_the_rite_of_spring/), though I did not address the ""why"". To summarize, the audience included both posh, older, conservative upper-class people, and a younger, ""bohemian"", avant-garde crowd. The former got personally insulted by Diaghilev's and Nijinsky's disregard for ballet conventions and by Stravinsky~~Diaghilev~~'s ""cacophonic"" music. They started booing and cat-calling, an old tradition in French theatre, though by the turn of the century demonstrations of audience's displeasure [were considerably more civil than they used to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nt2jlz/why_were_theater_riots_so_prevalent_around_the/) (also: [Tomatoes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/xbatpc/theres_a_trope_involving_disgruntled_people/)). The younger crowd responded in kind, which resulted in a brief (but stressful) ""fight"" that did not prevent the performance from ending peacefully, and later performances went well too. Moore (2009):

>Nijinsky had worked with his dancers to create a body shape for the entire ballet that seemed to be the exact opposite of the openness and lightness of classical ballet. Toes and knees were turned in rather than out in the traditional ballet pose, feet were mostly flat on the floor not on point, and the energy of the dancers’ bodies was directed downwards into the ground rather than up into the air.


>Just as the curtain rose, the music underwent a sudden and shocking transformation: the orchestra took up the plucked violins’ rhythmic pulsing from a moment before and amplified it into a loud, stabbing, dissonant dance, with unpredictable slashing accents. The circle of men, crammed closely together, dressed in heavy tunics and fur hats, began a stamping, jerking dance in their knock-kneed position, each one mimicking the rhythms of the orchestra but each having his own individual variation like some kind of demented machine. Another rule of ballet was broken in that, when the curtain opened, the performers were not facing out to the audience in the generous, open display of classical ballet, but their bodies were turned inwards and downwards in the tight, huddled circle. It was at this point that, in Stravinsky’s words, the storm broke. Those who were appalled by the ballet no longer felt restrained, and those who were defending it were equally energetic. The company’s ballet master Sergey Grigoriev described what happened next: ‘A section of the audience began shouting its indignation; on which the rest retaliated with loud appeals for order. The hubbub soon became deafening.

Writer Jean Cocteau, a friend of Stravinsky, Nijinsky and Diaghilev, who was there and had to comfort the three men afterwards (Cocteau, 1918, [*Le Coq et l'Arlequin*](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Coq_et_l%E2%80%99Arlequin)):

>The audience played the role it was supposed to play; it immediately revolted. People laughed, booed, hissed, imitated the cries of animals, and perhaps they  might have got tired in the long run if the crowd of aesthetes and a few musicians, carried away by their excessive zeal, had not insulted and even jostled the people in the boxes. The uproar degenerated into a free for all. Standing in her box, her tiara askew, the old countess of P. brandished her fan, and shouted, her face red: ""This is the first time in sixty years that anyone has dared to make fun of me."" The good lady was sincere; she believed in a mystification.

It is clear that part of the audience and critics reacted strongly and negatively to the piece, but there was no repeat of the premiere's scuffle and the *Sacre* was quickly considered to be a classic.

AskHistorians,"How much of Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" movie was accurate vs exaggerated/fake?","It's not an easy question to answer. I have written a [rather long essay recently about the question of ""accuracy""](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/fact-fiction-and-the-father-of-the-bomb-on-christopher-nolans-oppenheimer/), and talk about the Truman scene in particular. The reason it's not easy to answer is that while Nolan certainly made editorial choices about what to include or not, and even creative reinterpretations of things, it isn't like there is some perfect yardstick to compare these two. We simply don't know what Truman and Oppenheimer said to each other in that meeting; we have different bits of evidence, none of which are unimpeachable or clear. Even the date of the meeting is itself interpreted. 

That doesn't mean there aren't things that Nolan did that diverged from broad truth (like making Lewis Strauss Chairman of the AEC much earlier than he was in fact Chairman — he didn't become Chairman until 1953 — or having Oppenheimer consult with Einstein about atmospheric ignition, rather than Arthur Compton), for the sake of making a coherent narrative or expressing a particular position. But such distortions are unavoidable when translating a life (or a book) into a film, and many of them were clearly done deliberately. No historical film is even closely ""accurate"" by that definition; if one gets into the question of how much is ""unsaid"" (what is shown or told and what is not) and the ultimate totality of what _could_ be said, then no history book is, either. So it is better to have more specific questions, like what we do or don't know about the Oppenheimer-Truman meeting. That is answerable. ""How accurate is this movie"" is not really that answerable (more accurate than a movie that is totally made up, less accurate than a long and careful work of academic history?)."
AskHistorians,"I understand that the atomic bomb was viewed as needed for the “unconditional” Japanese surrender, but what would a “conditional” surrender look like, was it on the table, and why was it unacceptable?","During the Potsdam Conference, several high-level people advised Truman, including the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, and Winston Churchill, to consider making a single ""condition"" for Japan: that they would be allowed to keep their Emperor. They considered this a likely sticking point for the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender. Keeping the Emperor would be a ""condition."" Stimson in particular had been advocating this for awhile. 

When the MAGIC decrypts of Japanese foreign intelligence indicated that indeed, this was the primary ""condition"" that even the ""peace party"" was committed to, Stimson felt vindicated. But after the Trinity test, Truman apparently felt quite confident, and sided with those, like Secretary of State James Byrnes, who didn't think they owed Japan any concessions, in part because of the perfidy of Pearl Harbor, and that they didn't need to give them any. 

The issue, as an aside, came up on August 10, 1945, as well, when the Japanese offered a conditional acceptance of the Potsdam terms — the same condition. There is an interesting note on this in Stimson's diary entry from that day:

> Byrnes was troubled and anxious to find out whether we would accept this in the light of some of the public statements by Roosevelt and- Truman. Of course during three years of a bitter war there have been bitter statements made about the Emperor. Now they come to plague us. Admiral Leahy took a good plain horse-sense position that the question of the Emperor was a minor matter compared with delaying a victory in the war which was now in our hands. 

> The President then asked me what my opinion was and told him that I thought that even if the question hadn't been raised by the Japanese we would have to continue the Emperor ourselves under our command and supervision in order to get into surrender the many scattered armies of' the Japanese who would own no other authority and that something like this use of the Emperor must be made in order to save us from a score of bloody Iwo Jimas and Okinawas all over China and the New Netherlands. He was, the only source of authority in Japan under the Japanese theory of the State.

In the end, even then Truman opted not to accept this, and doubled down on a the requirement for an unconditional surrender. The Japanese finally acquiesced to this, under the authority of the Emperor. Ultimately, the US Occupation allowed the Emperor to remain — albeit only after having him renounce his status as a deity, and in a more reduced role as a figurehead.

Anyway, the additional detail there is just to give a little more context to the US side of these things. The aforementioned ""peace party"" (a minority of the Japanese high command) also considered other possible ""conditions"" they might push for (like keeping certain territories overseas), but none of this manifested into any kind of actual ""offer"" at that time (and they did not have the authority to make an offer anyway).

I think it is worth noting that we don't know whether offering or agreeing to any of these conditions would have shortened or prolonged the war. It is an unknowable thing, and one's answers to that probably reflect one's prior convictions more than any facts on the ground."
AskHistorians,Titanic is said to have had a gymnasium. What types of exercise equipment would have been onboard in 1912?,"The First Class gymnasium was situated on *Titanic*'s Boat Deck (the uppermost), on the starboard side adjacent to the second boiler funnel, near to the First Class entrance (known for the Grand Staircase.)  There are photos of the gymnasium on the *Titanic* as well as her sister ship the *Olympic*, which show us some very specific exercise equipment.

In addition to the punching equipment (popular among those who used boxing as exercise) there were rowing machines, and equestrian and ""camel"" riding machines, which used a pacing motor to simulate riding patterns.  Second Class survivor Lawrence Beesley would not have been able to use the facilities while underway, but as it was the maiden voyage of a state-of-the-art ship, the mixing of the classes was possible before they embarked.  Beesley toured the gymnasium and wrote special note of the ""horse"" and ""camel"".   [*The Loss of the SS Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons, by One of the Survivors* by Lawrence Beesley, published in June of 1912.]

It was also a time when non-passengers and journalists could board the ships before they set sail.  Indeed, some of the most famous photos were taken by journalists and others who either boarded while in Southampton, or disembarked in Cherbourg or Cobh (then  called Queenstown.)  Once underway, the gymnasium was only used by First Class passengers, women in the mornings, and men in the afternoons.

The photos also show a pair of exercise bicycles, noted by the April 25th, 1912 issue of ""Cycling"" magazine as Hutchens-Hamilton home trainers.  This particular pair was linked to a large dial on the wall which would track the distance each bicycle had been pedaled.  In that way passengers could gamify their exercise in competition against another person.

In addition to the gymnasium itself, *Titanic* had a 30 foot swimming pool (noted as a ""Swimming Bath"" on the blueprints) which also had gender-segregated access times; a squash racket court, and a Turkish Bath with attendants, all below on F Deck.  (A ""Turkish Bath"" would be close to our modern spa's steam rooms or saunas.)

The First Class passengers were very well provided with the popular exercise equipment of the day.  They did pay a nominal fee every time they used the facilities, but most of them were well able to afford it.  The Second and Third Class passengers (and crew) were given no more than strolling the decks as exercise opportunities.

As an epilogue, 36 year old Thomas McCawley was the physical fitness instructor, or Gymnasium Steward, on the ship's crew.  He was said to have remarked that he wouldn't wear a life belt because he felt it would slow down his swimming.  He did not survive the sinking."
AskHistorians,"Did people in Victorian England ever ""dress comfy"" like we might switch into pajamas after getting home from work or on the weekends (outside of immediately going to bed)? If so, what are examples of what that might be?","Well this is a fairly broad topic, since Victorian England lasted seven decades and included a broad host of different social classes and genders. To simplify things a little, I'll focus on one of my main areas of expertise, middle to upper class women in the late 1800s. The short answer to your question is that yes, they did, and their main options were wrappers and tea gowns. 

To fully understand these garments, it's necessary to understand what the standard well-to-do woman's days and outfits were like. Usually, these women wore nightgowns to sleep in which were loose, long-sleeved, ankle-length dresses. These dresses were often very sheer and revealing, so they'd only be seen by one's intimate partner or female relatives. When a woman prepared for the day, she'd dress in layers that consisted of drawers (optional), a chemise or undershirt, petticoats, corsets, possibly a bustle or hoopskirt, and a gown or skirt and bodice combination. Of course there were different levels of formality depending on occasion, but those basic elements were essential for every ""decent"" outfit a woman would wear while running errands, cleaning the house, visiting others, going to events, and so on. Though Victorian women didn't do a lot of hard physical labor, they'd still wear corsets while doing active things like cooking or riding horses. 

So what did women wear if they wanted to relax without all these layers? The simplest option that even less wealthy women would have is the [nightgown](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/109202). This wouldn't have been appropriate to wear at meals or in the parlor, but it was certainly worn alone in the bedroom. Think of it like the Victorian version of granny panties and a giant tee shirt. 

The next level of casual outfits to wear at home would be a [wrapper](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/108107). This was a loose gown that typically tied at the waist and didn't require corsets. It could be worn over a nightgown or over a chemise and drawers. A wrapper was a popular choice to wear at breakfast or before getting dressed to go out. It was rarely used when guests were over, though [etiquette manuals](https://recollections.biz/blog/elegance-at-home-victorian-wrappers/#iLightbox[gallery10229]/0) did allow it if you were an invalid or postpartum mother relaxing at home. They were essentially the Victorian England version of a bathrobe or a nice set of pajamas. 

Both nightgowns and wrappers were worn throughout the century, but our final category of leisurewear, tea gowns, were more an 1850s to 1890s thing. Tea gowns were typically just one step below actual gowns. They were a little looser and could potentially be worn without a corset or with less layers. Often they used gathering or ruffles across the front to hide the uncorseted bosom. Unlike wrappers, tea gowns could be worn for evening meals or used to receive friends. Many women would stay in a tea gown all day if they were feeling lazy and didn't have plans to leave the home. A tea gown would essentially be like a modern athleisure set with leggings and a matching sports bra. [Early tea gowns](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/158839) started out as more of a structured version of a wrapper, but by the 1890s or so, they'd progressed to [highly ornate gowns](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/159102) that could occasionally be worn to go out to casual suppers with friends. Of course, [moralists were outraged](https://www.geriwalton.com/tea-gowns/) at the trend, since it implied women might be going out and seeing men outside their family while not wearing corsets, but the trend persisted nonetheless and helped Victorian fashion evolve into the more casual outfits of the 1910s and 20s."

The historian Cassius Dio, 150 years later, remembers the impact of the eruption. He was likely drawing on sources contemporary to the disaster:

Some thought that the Giants were rising again in revolt (for at this time also many of their forms could be discerned in the smoke and, what's more, the blaring of trumpets could be heard), while others believed that the whole universe was being returned to chaos or fire. Therefore the Campanians fled, some from the houses into the streets, others from outside to inside, some from the sea to the land and some  from the land to the sea; for in their excitement they regarded any place where they were not as safer than where they were. While this was going on, an inconceivable quantity of ash was was ejected, which covered both sea and land and filled all the air. It caused major injury of various kinds to men and farms and cattle, at random, but in particular it killed all the fish and birds. Furthermore, it buried two entire cities, Herculaneum and Pompeii, the latter while its populace was taking refuge in the theatre. Indeed, the amount of dust, taken all together, was so great that some of it reached Africa and Syria and Egypt, and it also reached Rome, filling the air overhead and darkening the sun. There, too, was a general fear and confusion that lasted for several days, since the people did not know and could not imagine what had happened, but, like the Campanians, believed that the whole world was being turned upside down, that the sun was disappearing into the earth and that the earth was being lifted to the heavens. At the time the dust did the Romans no great harm, though later they brought a terrible plague. (66.23)


So in other words, the inhabitants of the capital would have been quite aware of it. Elsewhere Dio briefly mentions the Imperial response to the disaster. We have very little surviving evidence for this part, but get a general idea:

> The emperor Titus sent two former consuls to Campania to oversee the restoration of the region, and bestowed upon the inhabitants not only general gifts of money, but also the property of the victims who had lost their lives and left no heirs. The emperor himself accepted nothing from any private citizen or city or king, although many kept offering and promising him large sums; but he restored all the damaged regions from his own funds.

If accurate, this is an interesting look at the status and expectations of the Roman Emperor in the Flavian period. In particular, as the organizer and chief financier of humanitarian efforts.
Whatever the restoration effort was, we know from archaeology that it did not result in the unearthing of any of the buried places (see the linked discussion above). They remained entombed under meters and meters of compacted ash for 1500 years. There is no evidence (that I know of) that new towns were actually founded in the area. Likely it became farmland, distributed to heirs and survivors by the Imperial commission. The landscape would have been forbidding and alien, initially. Rain, runoff from the mountain, and erosion would have reshaped the new ""surface"" quickly. I am not a scientist and I don't know how long it would take for a newly-deposited ash bed to become useable soil. Can you plow it? Will olive trees or grapevines grow in it? In the short term, the entire area would have been the site of an ecological disaster. We can look at the site of Mt St Helens for comparison, which has largely recovered as far as fish, animal, and plant life, and the two eruptions were very similar."
AskHistorians,How did the European countries forgive Germany so quickly after WWII?,"It wasn’t a short term memory, it was a big political push towards reconciliation. Speaking only for France here, it took years to build enough trust to achieve the Elysée Treaty in 1963.

Basically, even though resentment was still very much there (and to some extent still is today with the senior population having grown up during the war) the drive for peace and stability in Europe was much stronger. There were already some proposals and pushes in between the wars, with the Briand plan to create a mini-EU with France and Germany (his efforts were cur short when the German chancellor he was close with died and then with the 1929 economic collapse). Already at the time the French popular opinion was towards peace with Germany, more than the hatred of the 1914-1918 enemy.

So after WW2 the pan-european movement and politicians who had either lived the war in exile or in the resistance were pushing real hard for an end to the disastrous wars and finally achieving peace in Europe. That culminated in 1948 with The Hague conference that on one side created the Council of Europe with the Court of Human Rights to never again have states murdering their own citizens and discriminating « lower class citizens ». But also the foundations of the Coal and Steal Community followed almost a decade after the conference by the European Economic Community.

To be honest, I don’t know what the popular opinion was at the time, that’s the view from the politicians, intellectuals, lawyers, etc. Not the general public. But I do know that the 1940s and 50s have seen the creation and rapid massification of « twin cities » or « sister cities » across Europe. The main idea being once again to prevent a future war by getting the peoples to know each other better.

So TL:DR : bringing peace after two world wars came as a necessity immediately after WW2, regardless of people’s biases and resentment.

Now for the resentment part, it was again a big push by France and Germany to reconcile in the 1950s and mostly 1960s, again with the idea that it’s time to put an end to the rivalry after three terrible wars (counting the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871). But this time the idea was to build trust between the peoples, so the Elysée Treaty set up cooperation between schools and youth organisations through the Office Franco-Allemand de la Jeunesse, and increase in learning both languages in schools and tighter cooperation in certain domains. The Franco-German reconciliation is still today part of our history curriculum in schools and in 2017 a new treaty was signed in Aachen (Charlemagne’s capital city) to update the Elysée Treaty and go further. So in France this reconciliation is a long standing policy that went beyond just the French president and German chancellor holding hands over the tomb of the unknown soldier.

I just want to touch upon the OECD that at the time was called Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. This organisation kind of symbolises a certain pragmatism in the USA’s approach to reconciliation in Europe. The idea there was to distribute the massive Marshall Fund to European countries based on correct and updated economic needs of each country. So in no ways were the public opinions taken inti account, the idea was just to get Europeans at the same table to distribute amongst themselves a big chunk of money for reconstruction. And in a way it always helps with reconciliation to work together with a common goal. 

This pragmatism can also be seen with the denazification process that was kind of only half-heartidly conducted because a lot of the administration had to be part of the NSDAP, regardless of their true beliefs. And with the USSR’s sphere of influence sharing a border with the Allied occupation zones, the bigger problem wasn’t the resentment between Europeans and Germans or how to judge former Nazis, but the USSR breathing down everybody’s necks."
AskHistorians,Why did the Shia sect of Islam end up so dominant in Iran and Iraq while being suppressed everywhere else in the Islamic world?,"Seeing as no one has attempted to answer this question, here’s mine. I’ll preface this answer by saying that I am not a trained historian. However, I have read a bit on the spread of Shia Islam within Iran out of an interest stemming from my Muslim background. Thus, while I don’t know much about Iraq, I believe that I can speak with some certainty with regards to the situation in Iran. In short, the rise of Shi’ism in Iran (Twelver Shi’ism, to be exact) is the deliberate product of a long process of state-sponsored religious conversion that was first initiated during the reign of Shah Isma’il I, founder of the Safavid dynasty.

The reasons for such a policy are as varied as they are complex. There was of course the matter of personal devotion, him being the inheritor of the Sufi Safavid order which espoused Twelver Shi’ism. However, there were also important geopolitical considerations at play. The first 10 years of Isma’il’s reign had seen the Safavids annex a large swath of territories all around the periphery of the burgeoning Empire. As a result, Iran now found itself surrounded by hostile Sunni neighbours, with whom it was engaged in vigorous military and political competition, in the form of the Ottoman Empire to the West, and the Uzbek Shaybanids to the East. In addition, a large Sunni population still existed within both Iran and the territories which had fallen under its rule; indeed, before the Safavids’ accession, Iran itself was Sunni-majority. Within this context, the imposition of the state’s Shi’i creed on the Iranian population would confer upon them a distinct cultural and religious identity that would stymie any growing sympathy for Iran’s Sunni rivals, harden popular sentiments against these same rivals and allow for their mobilization in the prosecution of the Safavids’ campaigns, as well as consolidate the Safavids’ rule by fostering loyalty to the state and its institutions.

And that was what Isma’il vigorously set out to do. First, he marginalized the Sunni faith. A relentless campaign of religious persecution was initiated against the existing Sunni clergy and their followers, intending to force their compliance with the new creed. Those who resisted faced dispossession and/or death, as was the case in Tabriz in 1501, Isfahan and Shiraz in 1503, and Baghdad in 1508. With the assistance of guiding Shi’a clerics, he also permitted or instituted practices that were hostile to Sunni beliefs. For example, he allowed the practice of *tabarra’iyan,* or the public cursing of figures revered in Sunni Islam such as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, by roving bands of Shi’ite preachers. He also suppressed folk practices which were seen as being pro-Sunni, such as the public storytelling of epics that praised historical Sunni notables.

To secure adherence to the new creed, however, Isma’il needed to ensure the consistent policing of public faith throughout the Empire. Thus, he pushed through a slew of measures that grew the Shi’ite clerical class and granted them unprecedented authority over Iran’s religious affairs. A new body of Shi’a clerics was imported from the traditional centres of Shi’ite learning around the Arab world, such as Jabal ‘Amil in southern Lebanon and the shrine cities of southern Iraq. Aside from preaching Twelver Shiism to the populace, these *ulama* were tasked with translating and making their Arabic teachings accessible in Persian. In return, they were granted state patronage in the form of *waqf* (Islamic charitable endowments)—the fact that they were often alien to local cultures also precluded their forming rival networks of power. New offices were also created to better manage public religious affairs. As the Safavids’ Qezilbash forces were settling in the newly conquered territories, Isma’il instituted the office of *khalifat al-khulafa,* who monitored their “spiritual” relations with the Shah through networks of agents. Later, he would create the office of *sadr*: this office possessed full authority over Iranian religious affairs, overseeing all clerical and judicial appointments, *waqf*, and the public’s conversion to Twelver Shi’ism.

In summary, Shi'a Islam's predominance in Iran can be attributed to a series of deliberate measures that had been instituted by Shah Isma’il I during his reign, and that were often continued by successive rulers. Through a combination of strident force and selective patronage, Sunnism was systematically marginalized by the state, being replaced at all levels by the state’s preferred Twelver Shi’ism. (Of course, I must stress that this says nothing about the authenticity of popular Shi’ite piety; by the reign of Shah ‘Abbas, Shi’ism was accepted by most sectors of the populace, who actively participated in its discourse.)

AskHistorians,Why did Lithuanian paganism persist for so long?,"I am not a historian, but I am studying history at the undergraduate level and this is the exact question I would love to grapple with professionally. I've lurked here for a while, so I figure this to be a good opportunity to give a try at answering.

The short answer to this question, like most things, is that there's not one single good answer, that this question is still being actively debated, and that there's a variety of factors that may or may not have contributed to the longevity of polytheism in Lithuania. I will, however, try to give my impression, and my thinking behind it.

One thing to note before I continue, and I believe this to be important when discussing pre-modern religion of any kind, is that these people, in most cases, actually believed the religions they follow. From our modern secular perspective, it can be easy to view religion and religious officials, especially in the Middle Ages, as a sort of means to an end. For example, one might say that Catholics really only tried to convert their pagan neighbours to try and gain allies, or to keep them from raiding them and attacking monasteries. And while this may be true, it is also true that behind these conversion efforts was likely a real, genuine belief in spreading their faith. This same logic applies to Lithuanian polytheists. For whatever political or economic reasons they had to convert or not to convert, there is also the fact that they very probably did believe in the gods they worshipped, and abandoning the faith that you were raised on, and that your father and grandfather followed is, generally, a very personally difficult thing to do and not an easy choice to make.

It is also worth noting that dates for conversion are almost always guesses and rough estimates. Merely because a ruler converts from one faith to another, does not necessarily mean that the wider population does the same. Conversely, a ruler's conversion may only take place when a majority, or otherwise significant portion, of the population has already done so. Since there are no medieval censuses that provide data on religious demographics (at least, not that I know of for this time period),

Now, one factor that I think can almost indisputably have influenced the survival of Lithuanian polytheism into the 14th/15th century is geography. The eastward spread of Christianity was, generally, a slow process that gradually snowballed around the 10th/11th centuries. By around that point, many of the central European kingdoms/duchies that would play a role in the next few centuries were taking shape and had converted to the Catholic faith (Poland, Hungary, Bohemia). Similarly, the Rus' convert roughly around this time as well. Their close connections with Constantinople seemed to have largely contributed to this, and its spread was quick as the rivers of what is now western Russia provided relative ease of transport across that section of landmass. It is, fittingly, around this time that we see some of the first documented Catholic missions to the Baltic (for example, Adalbert of Prague in the 10th century). However, these don't seem to have really ""stuck"" in the same way that similar, previous efforts did in places like Scandinavia and what is now Germany. Why?

Again, there is not really one good answer, but some could be postulated. This time period also corresponds with some crises in Catholic Christianity; the Great Schism occurs, officially fracturing the churches along largely geographic lines. The Crusades also begin, and I think there is something to be said about the fact that the attention of many Catholic nobles and clergy was focused upon the Levant during this time frame, which may have put the conversion of the Balts and Finns on relatively low priority. This is, however, not something I can speak to particularly well, as it's not an area I have a great deal of knowledge in. There's really no way of knowing from a Lithuanian perspective, either, as it is important remember that there are just about exactly 0 contemporary written sources provided by Lithuanians before the 16th century.

To look back to Lithuania specifically, it is important to note that there were some ""close calls"" with conversion to Christianity. Around 1250 or 1251, Grand Duke Mindaugas was baptised as a Catholic and crowned the first (and only) King of Lithuania, although he does not seem to have required his subjects to convert alongside of him. There has been some debate on whether or not his conversion was genuine; on the one hand, some near-contemporary sources like the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle describe him as continuing to practice pagan rituals. On the other hand, he apparently gave a significant degree of land to the Catholic Livonian Order. Whether this was done out of some genuine faith, for political reasons, or if the land's transference to the Livonian Order was fabricated is up to debate as well. In any case, Mindaugas was assassinated in 1263. His son, Vaishvilkas, was an Orthodox Christian and had been living in a monastery before returning to Lithuania to claim the title of Grand Duke but surrendered the title after only a brief period. This created a period of interregnum, of which little is known, except that a man named Traidenis came to power around 1269. Contemporary sources describe him as a staunch pagan, and this could very well be true, as he led at least two major campaigns against the Livonian Order, defeating them decisively in battle at several points. It could be very easy to view the downfall of Mindaugas and the rise of the pagan Traidenis as an anti-Christian reaction among the Lithuanian nobility, and this could very well be true, but I would caution against viewing that as concrete. Again, so little is known about this time, especially from the Lithuanian perspective, and it may very well have been far more complicated than that.

Following Traidenis's rise came over a century of on-and-off warfare between the Catholic crusaders and the Lithuanians. Something that seems to have contributed to the longevity of Lithuanian polytheism was the success of the Lithuanians in warfare. This is almost impossible to quantify, and is even difficult to qualify, but something I believe deserves some note. The Livonian and Teutonic Orders, for whatever reason, seem to have been incapable of achieving any major decisive battlefield victories against the Lithuanians. To draw some comparisons, the Saxons that battled Charlemagne did so for several decades, but eventually converted en masse, seemingly in large part due to their inability to withstand Frankish military might. Similarly, back to the Baltic, the Estonian peoples were consistently and decisively defeated and conquered by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, as were any subsequent rebellions, which seems to have played a major role in their gradual conversion to Christianity. This same trend does continue into Lithuania; the crusaders suffer several devastating military defeats fighting both the Lithuanians and Samogitians and seemed to have been unable to gain a true military foothold in Lithuanian territory. Again, there could be any number of reasons for this, but I don't feel qualified to truly touch on those. However, the correlation between military success and conversion is fairly high, and in Lithuania, crusader military success just wasn't there.

* A number of the king of Franks/ East Francia/ Germany, such as King Henry the Fowler (d. 918-36) and Emperor Otto II, in fact tried to invaded Jutland Peninsula in the 10th century. The cited poem in the linked thread refers to the assistance of the protagonist of the poem (Jarl Håkon of Lade) to King Harald Bluetooth of the Danes by the battle between the Danes and the Saxons in 974. At least once the invaders [under the leadership of Henry the Fowler] won against the Danes and make their ruler named Gnupa baptized, according to a German chronicler, Widukind of Corvey. The defeated ruler of the Danes, however, was probably just one of several petty kings who competed each other in southern Denmark in the first half of the 10th century (If you are interested in this chaotic period, please also check [Who were the ruling class of the Viking Age in Scandinavia?

* A few scholars also propose an hypothesis that King of the English [Æthelred II the Unready] allied with the second-in-line leader of the Viking fleet like Olaf Tryggvason, in order to divert the resource of the leader of the invading Viking fleet, King Sweyn Forkbeard, between their homeland and the invasion itself. I wonder if this kind of ""hiring the Viking mercenary against other Vikings"" attempt can also be counted as a counter-attack attempt in OP's definition.

AskHistorians,Floating Feature: The History of Poor Communication,"OK, so this is one of my favorite ""poor communication"" stories. Because it's just... wow.

In 1940, Germany invaded Denmark. The famed Danish physicist Niels Bohr sent a telegram to his colleague Otto Frisch, then in England, telling him that, so far, things with Bohr were OK. He ended the telegram with the admonition that Frisch should send this news to ""Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent.""

Cockcroft was a major British physicist, discoverer of the neutron. But who was Maud Ray Kent? Nobody had heard of this person before. So they decided that this was a secret message from Bohr, meant to evade censorious German eyes. Doing a little bit of anagramming, they discovered the provocative phrase RADYUM TAKEN — the Germans, Bohr was telling them, had taken the radium from his institute! Given the secrecy of the message, and its intended recipient, this could only be Bohr trying to warn the British that the Germans had taken a serious interest in neutrons... which could mean atomic fission, which could mean atomic bombs.

The British were already getting pretty worried about the possibility of a German atomic bomb project, and this had come not long after Frisch and another colleague (Rudolph Peierls, who along with Frisch was a Jewish refugee from Germany) had calculated that the amount of pure-U-235 necessary for an atomic bomb was a lot lower than anyone had expected, and thus potentially attainable by Germany. The British were primed to take this warning from Bohr very seriously. They created a research group dedicated to figuring out how serious the threat of a German bomb was, and in honor of their friend under occupation, they called themselves the MAUD Committee.

Eventually, the MAUD Committee would conclude that only two nations — the United States and Germany — stood a chance to make an atomic bomb under the constraints of the present war. They rushed a report to this effect to the United States, hoping it would spur them into action... but it had no obvious impact. So in the summer of 1941, the MAUD Committee sent an emissary, Marc Oliphant, to discover the fate of their report. He found that the US uranium work was haphazard and being mismanaged by people who did not think it was an urgent matter, and nobody had seen the results of the British work. He shared them with several key US scientist-administrators, who wrested control of the program into their more vigorous hands, and within a year this became the Manhattan Project which produced the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So the MAUD Committee, named for Bohr's warning, had a much larger impact than many know. 

But here's why this is filed under ""poor communication"": when Bohr escaped Denmark to England in 1944, his British colleagues were shocked to find out that he wasn't sending them a secret message about Germans seizing radium. He was trying to convey a message of their good health to his children's former governess, a certain Miss Maud Ray, then living in Kent, England."
AskHistorians,Did WWI-era airplanes actually use lubricant that often splashed pilots in the face and caused them to shit their pants?,"The problem is that this will be basically trying to prove that something *didn't* happen which is difficult to say. It should be fairly obvious that wartime conditions were hardly conducive to health, and diarrhea was a common challenge for medical staff. A medical history of the U.S. in WWI is replete with references to diarrhea (but none to the issue OP poses).

The earliest scholarly reference I found is a single statement that castor oil gave WWI pilots diarrhea that is uncited in a dissertation by Noe in 1989. My *fairly low confidence inference* as informed by the endemic nature of health problems on the front, the well known properties of castor oil, and the rudimentary status of flight medicine, is that the inhalation was not a direct cause of these issues.

Castor oil was frequently used as a lubricant in WWI era planes. See for example Kerley's article (citation below). Both mineral oil and castor oil were used for engine lubrication. Each had slightly different properties, but the primary distinction was as much their method of procurement (castor oil was from a crop that could be sourced from Britain's empire, mineral oil could be obtained from the United State's natural resources) as their tribology. Castor oil worked quite well however with the air cooled rotary engines due to not mixing with the fuel which was believed to improve lubrication. These engines did not have a closed loop oil system like a modern auto engine but instead leaked, burned, or exhausted all the oil (per Kerley). Kerley also notes that mineral oil was frequently blended in some amount with castor oil for cold weather tolerance. The only note of non-lubrication side effects in that paper is an anecdote about a leak spraying into a neighboring garden and killing some peas.

A bit of cynical speculation is that drinking castor oil would have been a very reliable way for a pilot to end up in the sick bay and therefore not be able to fly combat mission. Flight medicine was essentially in its infancy in WWI and all sorts of maladies from altitude related maladies to the stress of combat were very poorly understood on the whole.

AskHistorians,"Why did Sweden design so much of her own military equipment during the Cold War, instead of using designs from other countries?","I think I can answer this, I wrote my master's thesis on Sweden and the Cold War (although not on the defense industry specifically). 

The main idea Sweden had with its neutrality policy was to not be too dependent on other countries in order to credibly maintain neutrality during wartime. To be taken seriously as a neutral nation wedged in between the western and eastern blocs, you had to produce and supply military equipment for yourself, in the Swedish view. If war broke out between the superpowers, they would still want to be able to maintain a strong defense to deter the superpowers from going through Sweden like Germany had done to Belgium twice earlier. Additionally, if Sweden would actively get drawn into a conflict with either of the superpowers while using their equipment, it could lead to a vulnerability to supplying, repairing and reinforcing the armed forces if you're actively in conflict with them.

This policy, in extension, means that you have to do everything yourself: research and development; design, production, maintenance, repairs, etc. for various weapon systems: tanks, planes, artillery, submarines, and even nuclear weapons (although it never came to fruition). It wasn't only military things either, the robustness of society as a whole was supposed to survive a potential war as well, which is why civil defense and food production were also prioritised, for example.

However, there are a couple of caveats about this official position, which was communicated both domestically and internationally.

This was a convenient policy to have, considering Sweden's experience before, during, and after WW2. After WW1, Sweden became a democracy and the _'Fortified poorhouse'_ was to become a modern democracy.  The armed forces saw big cuts to its funding in the 1920s and was in bad shape when the 1930s came around and conflict started to brew down on the continent. A new defense act was approved in 1936, but it proved hard to import defense equipment with every other nation in Europe engaged in an arms race that erupted into war a few years later. This left only one option: DIY. Sweden ramped up its defense production in the late 30s. Most notably, SAAB (aircraft) was founded in these years. 

Despite prime minister Per Albin Hansson's declaration that ""Our preparedness is good"" in 1939, Sweden wasn't really ready for war, but in 1945 it was a different story. Sweden had navigated itself through the war without getting actively involved in the fighting, and by now the defense industry was doing well and Sweden was among the world's largest weapons manufacturers. Naturally, the armed forces were also in good shape, considering they hadn't had to fight during the war and being better equipped than ever.

From this position, it isn't strange that Sweden would continue on a similar path and make these circumstances part of its post-war neutrality policy. When all the components needed from R&D to production are already there, why stop? Discussions were held with the Nordic countries to create a Nordic defense alliance, but when this fell through and Denmark and Norway joined NATO instead in 1949, this further convinced Sweden to continue with their own defense industry.

Then we come to the second caveat: the defense industry wasn't truly independent during the Cold War. The 'motto' for Sweden's security policy was _""Alliansfrihet i fred syftandes till neutralitet i krig""_ ('Alliance-free in peacetime, aspiring for neutrality in wartime'). Being ""alliance-free"" didn't mean that Sweden isolated itself entirely from others, even when it comes to military equipment. Although not communicated officially, Sweden had strong connections to the US and UK regarding defense technology during most of the Cold War, in an informal way. The cooperation was deepened the further the Cold War progressed, and Sweden got a lot of advanced electronics, computer systems, software, etc. from the US. 

Sweden's semi-alignment with the west wasn't completely unknown to the public, though. It was always clear who were friends (western Europe and the US) and who were foes (the USSR and the Warsaw pact countries) with regards to Sweden's security concerns. There is an anecdote about a journalist asking an army general during a press briefing if they had any plans for if the enemy were to come from the west instead of the east. The general promptly drew an arrow from Murmansk around Scandinavia on his map and said: ""That would be a hell of a detour!"". This pretty much sums up Sweden's allegiances in a potential World War 3, Sweden might not join the war actively, but if they were drawn in, it was never any doubt which side they'd be on. 

The defense industry was an important part of the image as a neutral country, and a convenient tool to use to that end, considering Sweden's position at the end of World war 2.

Sources: Most of this is written from memory, but originally (mostly) from the work by Wilhelm Agrell, who has written numerous works about Sweden's defense and security policy during the Cold War. For an overview, I'd suggest _Fred och fruktan. Sveriges säkerhetspolitiska historia 1918-2000_, but I think it's only available in Swedish."
AskHistorians,Why did the Romans withdrawl from England have such an impact on culture and society in Britain when they had coexisted for over 500 years?,"The first point to emphasise is that the Romans did not formally withdraw from Britain. This narrative developed in the historiography of Britain itself, first in the *De Excidio* of Gildas and then with his transcriber Bede. Roman accounts however, specifically those of Zosimus and Procopius, describe political tumult in Britain and the Western Empire as a whole leading to Britain effectively rebelling against Roman rule, and ‘expelling Roman officials’. What appears to have taken place is that, forced to organise their own response to barbarian attacks, British *civitates* (local government units) repudiated the rule of the rebel emperor Constantine III. After Constantine III’s defeat by the emperor Honorius, the latter was unable to reestablish rule over Britain. There certainly seem to have been some in Britain who wished to return to central Roman rule: Zosimus described Honorius’s apparent response to them in 410, Gildas transcribes a petition written seemingly in the 440s, and the British king Riothamus brought an army to Gaul c. 470 at the behest of the emperor Anthemius. There is also the point that ‘Roman’ and ‘Briton’ were not discrete identities. All Britons within the empire had been Roman citizens since 212. Latin is now generally believed to have become the lingua franca of south-eastern Britain: the wealthy lowland zone characterised by towns and villas. British potters produced ceramics in a continental, Roman style. Many Britons practised the official imperial religion of Christianity. British aristocrats had villas with underfloor heating, the overlying mosaics mixing Greco-Roman iconography with distinctly native art. We must recognise Roman identity in the later empire as a very fluid thing, one that could be applied or denied according to political convenience (any potential barbarian heritage or association of deposed emperors was emphasised). It no longer meant being of the city of Rome in particular, but nor was it entirely synonymous with the Roman citizenship extended to the entire empire. Based on the *Historia Francorum* of Gregory of Tours, we can see that the Latin-speaking Gauls at least regarded themselves as Roman by the fifth century. However, Gildas, writing about the same time as Gregory, informs us of essentially the opposite with regard to the Britons, who are decidedly separate from the Romans in his retrospective. This is perhaps surprising given that the quality of Gildas’s Latin is on a par with that of ‘Roman’ writers, and that Gildas had access to Continental sources. In the same period, the Greek-speaking people of Greece and Anatolia came to thoroughly define themselves as ‘Roman’, with Greek effectively replacing Latin as the ‘Roman’ language. In contrast, panegyrics and histories from the fourth to sixth centuries indicate that Britain remained an exotic place to the people of the Mediterranean imperial heartland. If we go back to around the time of the end of central Roman rule in Britain, Patrick, a Briton, appears to not quite have viewed himself as a Roman, but still as their ‘fellow-citizen’, and it is worth noting that the primary identity of Britons in Gildas’s time appears to have been ‘citizens’. In answer to your question ‘How is it that there was still such a divide between Roman people and British people?’: there wasn’t.

The point of all this is to demonstrate that the decline of technology in Britain was not a matter of the ‘Romans’ leaving and taking their technological expertise with them. The Romans never restricted their technology to ‘Romans’, however much Romans in Italy thought of the Britons as exotic near-barbarians. British cities had skilled potters, metalworkers, glaziers, builders, masons, mosaicists, and painters, all producing very Roman work. Although much of Britain’s wealth was owned by Continental aristocrats who left the management of their estates to bailiffs, native British aristocrats had plenty of access to Roman technology, perhaps displayed most clearly in the many private bathhouses dotted about the West Country. It is important to note that technological decline in this broader period was not unique to Britain: it also took place in Gaul, Spain, and even Italy, if not to the same extreme. At the same time, much of the Eastern Roman Empire, which survived, was going through a period of considerable prosperity. Historians and archaeologists hold the reason for technological decline in Britain to not be related to the movement of an ethnic group, but to massive economic decline. I use the word decline cautiously, because it is debated whether decline or collapse is the more appropriate label. The sudden collapse model is exemplified in Simon Esmonde-Cleary’s *The End of Roman Britain*, which views a prosperous Romano-British economy crashing in the wake of the end of Roman political security and the economic structures it permitted. Richard Reece meanwhile pioneered the idea of a far more gradual decline beginning from the early fourth century, also arguing that Roman Britain had never developed much of an urban economy. Neil Faulkner, following on from Reece, emphasised the weakening of the imperial system in Britain over the fourth-century in this economic change, while James Gerrard, arguably following on more from Esmonde-Cleary, examines the decline of Roman civilian ideology in the fraught political world of the fifth century. Both sides of the discussion have merit in explaining how Britons stopped using many Roman technologies. A lack of political stability meant poorer agricultural productivity and less trade, leaving secondary industry less sustainable both due to demand and sheer practicality. Aristocrats had bigger spending priorities than hypocausts and fine tableware; i.e. military retinues. Elite sites such as York and Binchester see a decline in high-status ceramics and the disuse of bath-houses, but massive bone deposits from younger animals, suggesting an expanded feasting culture. As Reece argues, Britain’s urban economy of specialist manufacturers was already relatively small and brittle, catering to a rural aristocracy that often did its best to avoid the towns themselves. The imperial mint in London ceased to produce coins in the late third century, the supply of bronze coins from the Continent ceased in the 370s, and that of silver coins c. 400. In the late fourth-century, some architectural techniques began to disappear from new works. The construction of late fourth-century walls at villas and high-status buildings are often of relatively shoddy construction, having fairly neat stone facings, but roughly infilled with rubble and mortar. Such construction can also be seen (to this day) at distinctly non-Roman sites in Cornwall and western Wales, for instance at Din Lligwy.

But just as a lot of Roman technology was becoming less common in the fourth century, it may well been that a lot survived into the fifth. Our dependence on the coin record for dating means that, without expensive carbon-dating, nothing can be securely dated to the post-Roman period. This is because new coins stopped reaching most of Roman Britain by 402, with hardly any appearing after c. 420. This has meant that many late buildings and finds are dated to around the end of Roman rule, even though they may well be later in date. Four years ago a mosaic with two associated fifth-century carbon dates was found at Chedworth villa in Gloucestershire. A late fourth-century townhouse in St Albans was maintained into the mid-fifth century, and Gildas informs us (by his own education and his description of that of a king named Maglocunnus) that a classical Latin education could still be had in sixth-century Britain. Nonetheless, stone buildings, wheel-thrown pottery, and glass had all pretty much entirely ceased to be produced in post-Roman Britain by the end of the fifth century, the towns that sustained them continuing to have political importance, but becoming economically indistinguishable from other villages. While Continental towns went into decline in this period, many retained technologies and industries such as pottery at a reduced scale, and continued to support specialist manufacturers. In Britain, ‘cities’ ceased to be towns at all, and most specialist manufacturing disappeared. There were still people with the kind of wealth and resources which could have once afforded Roman luxury; the massive elite centre at South Cadbury, with its halls and partly stone fortifications, is testament to this. But the halls were timber. The only settlement in post-Roman Britain which saw the construction of a large number of new stone buildings was Tintagel, which had considerable trading links to the Mediterranean, and thus access to architectural techniques which were not accessible in most of Britain."

AskHistorians,Why do modern day Protestants continue to give value to ancient Phoenician deities?,"Great question!  I can handle the ancient parts of this question, but I'd love it if experts on Christian demonology or Fundamentalist rhetoric could answer more fully on later periods.

Let's start by taking our terms apart in turn.

**Ba'al**/**Baal** (בַּעַל) is a common ancient Hebrew word meaning owner, lord, or master.  In the law (e.g. Exodus 21-22) it usually refers to legal owners of things. In a political context, it usually refers to the nobility/leaders of a town or region (e.g. 1 Sam 23:11-12, 2 Sam 21:12, Isaiah 16:8).  In the context of marriage, it refers to the husband (e.g. Isaiah 54:5).

Baal is used throughout the Old Testament in a variety of ways, including as a plural for various gods apart from Yahweh (e.g. Judges 2:11), but often refers to a particular deity, most often Baal Hadad, a popular storm god.  Baal Hadad is the antagonist in the story of Elijah, which climaxes in a contest between Yahweh and Baal atop Mt. Carmel in 1 Kings 18 to see who truly controls lightning (to light the altar) and rain (to end the drought).

**Moloch/Molek** (מֹלֶךְ) is a vocalization of the Hebrew letters MLK, which are the same as *melek* (מֶלֶךְ king) or *malak* (מָלַ֖ךְ reign).  Hebrew has no proper vowel letters, and so the vowels we use are generally sourced from the Masoretic Text, a medieval Jewish rendition of the Bible in Hebrew with vowel points (the tiny dots on next to the letters).  Some scholars have proposed alternate derivations, but the simplest and most widely accepted answer is simply that the word comes from the root for King/Rule.

But here's the tricky part: it's  not clear if Moloch was an actual deity or if it's a misunderstanding on the part of later interpreters.  Hebrew uses prefixed prepositions to convey ideas like to/for (L), as/like (K), in (C), or from (M).  We almost entirely encounter Molek in the form La/LeMolek or ""to Molek,"" and almost entirely in the context of child sacrifice.  Lev. 18:21, 20:2-5, 1 Kings 11:7, 2 Kings 23:10, Jeremiah 32:35 refer to the sacrifice of children, with most specifying ""in fire.""  Amos 5:26 is probably best translated with ""king"" rather than Molek, and that leaves only one instance in the whole Bible of Molek appearing without the lamed prefix, in Leviticus 20:5, where the prefix is replaced with the independent preposition אַחֲרֵ֥י (*achare*, after).  Because of the specificity of these references, modern scholars debate whether Molek was an actual diety, or rather just a prohibited form of sacrifice.  Human sacrifice was taboo in developed Judaism, and was often interpreted as being abolished in the Abraham/Isaac story, though its earlier existence is suggested by various stories in the Bible including the binding of Isaac and  the daughter of Jephthah (Judges 11).

(The existence of human sacrifice in Canaanite religion has been much debated, particularly because the primary written sources for its existence were written by their enemies (Jews for Canaanites, Romans for Carthaginians).  There is certainly a great deal of both documentary and archaeological evidence for child sacrifice, all of which has been questioned from many angles.  While an interesting debate, getting into such a question is beyond the scope of this answer.)

In any event, monotheists have vacillated ever since between viewing small ""g"" gods as misunderstood aspects of big ""G"" God, demons adversarial to God, or simply non-existent.  While the point of the Elijah story is that Baal either does not exist or has no real power, later sources do interpret Baal (or the baals in the plural) as demons.  Jesus seems to equate another Baal, ""Baal Zebul"" (Βεελζεβούλ, *Beelzeboul*) with Satan in Matthew 12 and Luke 11.  Jesus' opponents accuse him of being in league with Baal Zebul, whom they describe as ""ruler of demons"" (ἄρχοντι τῶν δαιμονίων, *archonti ton daimonion*).  1 Corinthians, an authentic Pauline epistle, may hint at differing opinions on this question in chapter 7, where Paul discusses how eating food sacrificed to idols (effectively any meat outside of Jerusalem) affects the conscience of various people.  In later demonology, many different pagan deities were interpreted as demonic figures.  (For a particularly vivid look, I recommend Satan's council in [Paradise Lost](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20/20-h/20-h.htm#link2HCH0002).)  

Later, the vivid creativity of authors such as Gustave Flaubert (Salammbo, [French](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/48881), [English](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/1290)) and G.K. Chesterton ([The War of Gods and Demons](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100311h.html#ch17)) brought a vision of the world of Canaanite/Punic religion into the public imagination.  The focus here was particularly on the practice of infant sacrifice.

Here I'm out of my historical depth, but what I do know is that all this got attached to the anti-abortion movement, which has developed a fascination with medical-waste incinerators.  The Bible doesn't actually include much of anything to go on if you are trying to argue against abortion, so it was helpful to attach on to the vivid (and terrible) image of child immolation to find a tie to the Biblical text.  It's a stretch, to be sure, but when Raphael Warnock calls himself a pro-choice Christian pastor and is accused of Moloch worship, this is what is being referenced."
AskHistorians,How was alcohol withdrawal managed in the early days of prohibition? Was there a large spike in hospital visits/admissions for withdrawal?,"In my area, at least, there was not any significant decrease in the availability of liquor. The mountainous northwest part of South Carolina, and across the state line into western North Carolina, developed legal liquor distillation as a primary economic driver as early as the 1790s. In the mid-1800s, a farmer producing 25 bushels of corn could sell it for about $12.50; or he could distill about 75 gallons of whiskey from it, worth more than $85. Distilling it would be!

In 1862 the money-strapped Confederacy put excise taxes on alcohol, and in 1866 the federal government made them permanent. That Revenue Act put an astonishing $2/gallon tax on alcohol, pushing the price of a gallon up almost triple. This started what became known as the Revenue Wars, which involved large-scale illegal distillation, raids by “revenuers,” shootouts, and numerous deaths on both sides. That geographic area came to be known as the Dark Corner. 

In the 1890s, parts of South Carolina made a hard push to become a dry state, due in large part to attempts to make the mill-working populace more “moral” (i.e., more controlled, stable workers who didn’t come in drunk). In 1893, a “compromise” was made by the the governor in the formation of a State Dispensary — a total state monopoly on production and sale. This escalated Dark Corner violence into the “Dispensary Wars,” and dispensary agents were attacked with the same intensity as revenue officers.

The result of this was a sophisticated underground distribution network through “blind tigers.” In many towns in the upstate of South Carolina, these took the form of reputable businesses which sold whiskey under the table or out the back door. In most towns, there were more blind tigers than legal dispensaries.

When federal prohibition arrived, it was simply one more in the string of events fueling the vast illegal distillation enterprise. A Captain revenue agent in the IRS said stills in the Dark Corner were “as thick as fleas in a hog pen.” In 1920, the first year of prohibition, more than 200 stills were destroyed in Dark Corner with no apparent decrease in production. In fact, national prohibition simply gave Dark Corner a larger market, and it likely reached peak production during that time. 

While I’m giving details on this one specific geographic locale, similar situations could be found across Appalachia.

There are numerous books and papers on the Dark Corner but the best source on its relationship with distilling is the doctoral dissertation of Joshua Beau Blackwell, now published as “Used To Be A Rough Place In Them Hills: Moonshine, the Dark Corner, and the New South.”"

AskHistorians,"My Asian step son says he can't work at the Renaissance festival, because there were no Koreans in Europe at the time. Is he right?","This depends on what time 'Renaissance' refers to. By the late 1500s/early 1600 (maybe a bit latter than the Henry VIII time most frequently portrayed in Ren Faires) there were people from East Asia in Europe. For example, Japan sent ambassadors to Spain (because they traveled via the Philippines/Mexico route) and to Rome. Some members of that mission stayed in Spain never returning to Japan.

A little bit before that mission, the most famous Korean who engaged in a similar journey was Luis de Velasco. He was a native of Korea, and likely brought to Mexico as an enslaved person. He ended up in the service of don Luis de Velasco (a two time viceroy of Mexico and one time viceroy of Peru). If he had been enslaved, Luis de Velasco did receive his freedom although we do not know much more about him. He ended up in Spain too when don Luis de Velasco returned to become President of the Council of the Indies. 

So, if we consider the late 1500s and 1600s as Renaissance there were absolutely East Asians in Europe. They may not have been numerous but they were present.

There has not been much written about Luis de Velasco because he is not well attested. I know of him through communications with other scholars, but don't have a good published source. This [website (in Spanish)](https://historiasdeamerica.wordpress.com/2016/04/20/el-criado-oriental-de-don-luis-de-velasco-el-joven/) quotes don Luis de Velasco's will which mentions his servant, but unfortunately does not give a specific archival citation. If there is interest I know who I can ask for that information.

The Japanese mission to Spain/Rome is better attested but the sources are more scattered. Here is an older source, but it covers the basic history. 

Nuttall, Zelia. *The earliest historical relations between Mexico and Japan*. University of California Press, 1906.

I know that wikipedia is discouraged, but in this case Hasekura Tsunenaga's page (the ambassador sent from Japan to Mexico and Europe in 1614) gives good information and the references there are useful.

AskHistorians,"Did Greek, Norse, and Vedic pantheons all originate from a more ancient Indo-European religion? If so, what did that religion originate from?","This is a great question. In fact it is THE question that helped draw me into folklore studies more than a half century ago. 

There are several issues to consider here. I avoid the term ""religion"" to describe what is going on here because the term conjures an image for the modern mind that doesn't really apply very well. We tend to think of religions as something filled with doctrine, dogma, and a professional, organized priesthood together with a written text holding everything together. Of course, that image is undermined by the fluidity of everything we describe today as ""religions."" Even religions change from generation to generation and place to place.

Greek, Nordic, and Vedic pantheons (whatever that means) find imperfect documentation in stories that are preserved from historic (often ancient) times. These stories are reflections of and reinforced belief systems that were themselves fluid. In their earliest manifestations, there were no written texts nor was there dogma/doctrine. And what priests existed may have been professional with a lower case ""p"", but they did not belong necessarily to a priesthood in the modern sense of the word.

So, we are trying to observe what is basically a variety prehistoric belief systems through their expression in stories, written down at a later stage in the development (or in the case of Nordic cultures, after the extinction) of those belief systems. We must keep in mind that while religions change over time and geography, so too do belief systems, particularly when they are untethered to a written sacred text and to an organized professional priesthood. We can talk about a Norse pantheon, but when we try to pin down the when and where of it, things become problematic: some cohesion likely tied the whole thing together, but variation ruled this domain of Northern European cultures before the conversion.

But let's say for sake of argument that we can reconstruct the quintessential Green, Norse, and Vedic pantheons respectively, and that we can use these to triangulate on ""the"" ancient Indo-European pantheon/belief system. What we are chasing, here, is an idealized moment when that culture was the common ancestor of all of these offspring. The problem we encounter is that ""that culture"" never really existed. Given that belief systems and their accompanying stories are fluid, whatever existed in ancient Indo-European prehistory was certainly fluid, spread over at least some geography, and traveling through time, changing all along the way. 

Efforts to reconstruct that early Indo-European language is equally problematic and reflects what we face when it comes to trying to understand early story and belief. We can theorize and reconstruct what the early Indo-European root of a word might have been, but that theoretical word may have only been spoken for a generation and only in one valley. Language changes over space and time just like belief systems and stories.

Efforts to reconstruct an ""ancient Indo-European religion"" are flawed because whatever that cultural institution was like among the earliest culture(s) that spoke Indo-European, it was in flux. More importantly, your question, ""what did that religion originate from"" betrays the real problem. Even if we could triangulate on that early ""ancient Indo-European religion"" we would inevitably ask the question - since belief systems and their stories are always in flux, what went before? The answer to that question is maddening.

We can imagine an answer, however, with a thought experiment. Let's imagine we have a time machine (and enough antibiotics to survive our journey!). We travel back to the Eurasian Steppes and document an ancient Indo-European belief system. We then travel to the next valley, and the next, documenting variation. We have arrived at an understanding of the range of possibilities at that time, and we have done a good job at documenting the loosely bound beliefs and stories that represent something of a cultural cohesion.

We then ask your question - but what went before? So we use our time machine to repeat the exercise, traveling several hundred years back at a time, tracking the ancestors or our first ethnographic study and documenting their belief systems and stories, and we begin to build an image of how things mutated and drifted over time. But this still doesn't satisfy our curiosity because we want to know what went before, so we repeat the exercise, jumping several hundred years at a time to earlier and still earlier times.

After repeating this exercise several dozen times, we develop a better understanding of the range of possibilities and how this belief system drifted and mutated, but what never emerges - and never can emerge - is a definitive ""earlier religion"" that spawned everything else. We can begin to see how some stories diffused in from elsewhere and were adapted as they were adopted, and we can see how other beliefs and their stories changed over time and space. The exercise would help us to understand a great deal about the earliest cultures - and more importantly culture changes - or the ancestorial speakers of Indo-European, but we would fail to arrive at the ""definitive"" religion.

Secondary source books on ancient mythologies can be deceptive in the way they lull readers into thinking that they are having some ability to merge into an ancient religion. These cultural institutions were not locked in stone - or print - until fairly late in the game. Change and variation are key to understanding what they were really about.

AskHistorians,"Eric Hobsbawm wrote in one of his books, ""In 1789 50% of the French people did not speak [French] at all, and only 12 to 13% spoke it 'fairly'"". What languages did these people speak, and was the same true in other European nation-states (e.g, Sweden, England, Spain, etc?)","The language that became standard French was one dialogue among many in the “ Langues d'oïl”, a language said that had evolved from vulgar Latin.  They were so named because the word for yes was “ oïl"", which over time has become “oui”.  These dial wax covered roughly what is northern and northwestern France today.

In 1789 people throughout this region would have spoken heavily accented dialects of this language.  “Standard” French would have been used in the capital and the area around it, and was also the official language of the court and legal proceedings, having replaced Latin in the 16th century.   The educated population would have been able to communicate in standard French.  

Southern half of France would have had a large population of “ langue d'oc” / Occitan speakers.  This was another widespread set of dialect group together because the word for US was some varioairon of “oc”, which was derived from the Latin “hoc”.  Again educated people and government officials would have been able to communicate in standard French. 

All of these dialects were fully functioning. Every day language is for the people that spoke them. I have the center of political power been elsewhere, then, one of these other dialects from the north or south could have developed into the standard national language. The political power, and the accumulated cultural power, happened to be centered in Paris.  By cultural power, I mean, the bulk of courtly poems and histories and other literary works, as well as scholarly works, tended to be written in what became standard French. 

In addition, different bits and pieces of what today make up modern France had some languages spoken in numbers, much larger than they are today   Breton, German dialects like Alsatian, Corsican, Basque.   

The driving force behind French standardization was originally the simple power of the court, and its ability to decree I. The 16th century  that French, as spoken in the capital, was the official language for law in education.  Knowing standard French, and speaking, it properly became important tools for political and social advancement.   

In 1789 you would still have stop had millions of average people speaking a local dialect, including varieties of Occitan.  Republican and then Imperial France, as with so many other aspects of French, life and culture, made an attempt to rationalize and standardize the French language. Even so, it took a protracted effort by the French bureaucracy to try to stamp out Occitan.  It was for bidden in schools and both children and adults for ashamed for using it  

Today, some of these small languages are undergoing a revival. As always, there’s a risk that an insufficient number of true native speakers will cause the language to mutate into a curiosity or die out entirely.   

I don’t have as much information on other countries, but I do know that a similar diversity of dialect existed in Italy, and in Spain  both countries went through processes of language, standardization, and often used some of the same tools of coercion and shame to replace the dialects with “good” languages. 

I know that in Spain, there has been definite pushback from, for example, Catalan speakers, who maintain the value and having their own language remain, and have a body of literature, which helps support that effort.  

 Keep in mind that the distinction between a dialect and a separate language is often very subjective, based on political power, and sometimes based on the fact that we know how the story plays out.  And it’s a lot easier to describe Norman French as a dialect if you know that it goes on to be somewhat overwhelmed by standard French."

AskHistorians,It's 90 BCE in the Roman Empire. What stops me from kidnapping a random traveler and selling that person in the nearest slave market?,"A previous answer I gave for [What was the process for enslaving someone in Ancient Rome?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/opcvxc/what_was_the_process_for_enslaving_someone_in/h654217/?context=3)covers some of this question. I will include some of these comments, but it covers more of the legality of enslavement.

As you note, the situation in 90 BCE is different than when there is a Roman empire proper--this is still the Republic, and the territories are much smaller than they would be later. As you note, citizenship status would limit who the rules apply to, and it certainly limited who the Romans cared about when this happened. Since the Romans were enslaving people through wars, they would also benefit from trade based, in part, on kidnapping. 90 BCE is also the middle of the Social War, in which many of the Italian allies were seeking citizenship (and in which many of them would have been enslaved due to war).

Most kidnappings would have been occurring outside of Roman control, at a time when other powers were in decline. Brigandage (at a seemingly quite organized level) was evidently enough of a problem for Pompey's famous campaign against the pirates in the 60s BCE. This was largely about control of the waters for Rome, rather than fighting against a motley collection of pirates. It also shows that such practices may have increased in scope in recent decades.

For the majority of people, nothing is stopping them from being kidnapped and sold into slavery, especially while traveling, but they might have some recourse to ransom before being enslaved. Their home community would have people able to attest to their free status, so one could not kidnap someone and enslave them in their community easily. It is difficult and costly to carry someone off far away, so it was more common for travelers to be the ones kidnapped, since they were already not near their homes. The idea that one could be captured while traveling frightened Romans and comes up often as a trope in literature.

Though people certainly were kidnapped and enslaved, they were also likely ransomed frequently. This allowed kidnappers to get a reward without the law-breaking or difficulties of enslaving a freeborn person. The most famous case of ransom is probably Plutarch's story of Julius Caesar being captured by pirates; he is said to have scoffed at the low ransom price they asked for. Otherwise, if they can't get ransomed, it would likely be hard to prove freedom unless very wealthy or well-connected."

AskHistorians,The Old Testament states that Jews should not get tattoos- when did ancient Jews ever even encounter cultures that practiced tattooing?,"They would have been intimately familiar with the usage, as they engaged in it within a broader Ancient Near Eastern slavery^(1) traditions\* and other practices (Mesopotamian, Egyptian, ...), e.g. there explicit references to this sort of markings in Elephantine papyri (e.g. TAD B2.11), legal documents from the period of Babylonian exile in 6th century - of course, it is hard to discern different types of brandings (as literal wording in Leviticus is ""incised writing"").

Common view for the prohibition was for quite a long time religious differentiation to foreign mourning ritual practices, but this assumption was never uncontentious, and the assumptions stem from structural interpretation of Levitican text, as there are little to no outside attestations of such practices^(2).

There is a positive reference in Isaiah 44 to branding (tattooing), as to convey submissiveness to the Lord, in line with broader connotations of markings and the relation between the Covenant and the Lord - while later ""redaction"" (in Lev.) takes a negative disposition in different context. Branding was associated with the issues of submissiveness (or ownership, though one can problematize vertical relations and terminology in ANE *ad nauseam*), other connotations (foreign, pagan practices) mainly come up from tannaitic period (with some antecedents) onwards, starting in rabbinical writings (e.g. Mishnah, Makkot 3:6, punishable with lashes - but there is contention whether the prohibition is absolute or only when idolatrous; and other medieval commentaries).

AskHistorians,"I would like to read the Iliad, which translation/version would you (a historian) recommend?","If you want to go hard-core, the Loeb Classical Library version by A. T. Murray, revised by William Wyatt (1924), is fairly literal, and has the Greek on the facing page (2 volumes).

The classic Richmond Lattimore translation (1951) attempts to reproduce in English certain aspects of the original (and unique) poetic diction of the Iliad: metric regularity suggesting the Greek hexamaters, and the use of fixed epithets, which were a feature of the oral transmission of the poem. The epithets include statements like ""wine-dark sea,"" ""rosy-fingered dawn,"" ""Apollo who strikes from afar,"" ""owl-eyed Athena,"" ""Hektor of the shining helm,"" and many others. All of this gives the translation a very formal flavor, though this may not be the easiest reading. But it does successfully convey things about the poem that are not found in more idiomatically English translations. The 2011 edition has additional historical information.

A recent translation by Barry Powell (2013) includes photographs of ancient artifacts, which can be variously helpful or interesting. For instance, on one page I read about a boars-tooth helmet and wondered what that was like. On the next page was a photo of one, reconstructed from a Mycenaean burial find. The translation is more idiomatically English than Lattimore, but remains heroic in style. 

An exceptionally readable Iliad comes from Stanley Lombardo (1997). It's diction is very American, and at times reminiscent of World War II movies, while surprisingly keeping faith with the Greek.

For background:

""The Singer of Tales"" by Lord and Parry (1961), is a classic treatment on bardic traditions like the one that led to the transmission of the Iliad over centuries.

""The World of Odysseus"" by Moses I. Finley (1954, 2002), is a classic treatment of the Iron Age social world depicted in the Bronze Age epic.

""The Trojan War: A New History"" by Barry Strauss (2006) looks at the late Bronze Age setting of the war."

AskHistorians,What was the cause for the drop of American high schools that offered shop classes in the '80s and '90s and through the early 21st century?,"Almost without fail, questions on here about American high school end up getting a bunch of answers that begin with ""At my high school..."" or some variation thereof. We remove them because of our rules around anecdotes but also because they're very often wrong for the simply fact that what was true at Smithtown High School does not necessarily reflect what's true at Smithville High School. There's a couple of reasons for that, all of which contribute to an answer for your question. 

First, although it may not seem like it, American high schools are fairly responsive to local needs and conditions. It's why, for example, there are high schools with agricultural sciences or courses in specific languages. This doesn't necessarily mean they're always responsive but it's more a case of course correcting a tanker than uh, something that's harder to course correct than a tanker. One of the reasons for those local quirks is that there really is no such thing as American high schools, per se. Due to the courts' and legislatures' interpretation of the 10th Amendment, education is a matter left up to the states and then there are certain matters that are left up local school districts (the concept of ""local control."") Some states allow more flexibility than others - slightly less than half the states are textbook adoption states, meaning the state education department determines which textbooks and curriculum resources teachers use while the rest set standards and leave the decisions about textbooks, materials, etc. up local districts. 

All states, though, set graduation criteria. While there are some differences between states, generally speaking, all states require high school level course work in English, mathematics, science, art, music, physical education, and a language (modern or Greek/Latin) - or what we think of as a liberal arts education. The reason for this continuity between states is mostly due to what's known as the [""Carnegie Unit""](https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/faqs/carnegie-unit/):

> The unit was developed in 1906 as a measure of the amount of time a student has studied a subject. For example, a total of 120 hours in one subject—meeting 4 or 5 times a week for 40 to 60 minutes, for 36 to 40 weeks each year—earns the student one “unit” of high school credit. Fourteen units were deemed to constitute the minimum amount of preparation that could be interpreted as “four years of academic or high school preparation.”

The Unit was established as way for schools to organize time in schools for several reasons, key of which was related to Andrew Carnegie's announcement in 1905 to fund college professors retirement provided they were working at a ""real"" college. The way he and his organization determined a college was ""real""? They only admitted students who were college-ready - that is, they had completed an accredited high school program that included a number of credits, or Carnegie Units.  Over the first few decades of the 20th century, American high schools developed a fairly standardized day. This isn't to say they weren't before Carnegie, as they were; the ""look"" of the American high school had mostly taken shape by the 1890s, even though high school was only something a few young people, mostly white girls, did. Taking a full day or week of Carnegie Units, though - often described as core courses or subjects - wouldn't fill a student's entire daily schedule. The nature of non-core classes is where local flexible and career and tech ed comes in. 

Back to my point about a fairly high degrees of local control and flexibility or what we've come to think of as ""electives."" At this point, it's important to stress that, despite a modern shift in messaging, the purpose of American public education has never been about preparing young people for the work force. A whole bunch went into the thinking behind the creation of tax-payer funded schools in every town but ""teaching kids to to be employees"" wasn't one of them in any meaningful way. To a certain extent, American public education is part of the whole ""American dream"" construct - the government provides a well-rounded liberal arts education to any child (which has expanded over time) who shows up and they can use that education to do whatever they want when they're an adult. This thinking helps us understand why most vocational preparation is at local community colleges or stand-alone business schools. At the same time, if a local community seems a specific need, one of the electives might address that need like the agricultural courses I mentioned earlier. 

There were, though, other pressures to expand what young people learned at school beyond just the core liberal arts. Beginning before World War II, courses like Homemaking (which evolved into Home Economics later Family and Consumer Science) were common. As were technical skill courses such as automotive repair, woodworking, architectural design, etc. It's important, though, to stress these were offered based on student and teacher interest as there was no administrative mechanism to speak of to force children into particular courses or classes. There were, though, social mechanisms and local decisions shaped by racism, classism, sexism that would result in particular students being encouraged to take particular courses or registered without their consent. These classes, though, generally speaking fit with the idea of a ""well-rounded"" liberal arts education - learning about the home and/or working with one's hands wasn't about a future job. It was more about being an educated young person.

There was a formal structure, though, for supporting teachers of these technical courses: *The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917*, which was the first authorization for the federal funding of vocational education (now known as Career and Technical Education). Smith-Hughes would later be reauthorized as the *Carl D. Perkins Act of 1984*, later the *Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act* (Perkins II) in 1990,  *Perkins* III in 1998, *Perkins* IV in 2006, and *Perkins* V in 2018. In some states, vocational and technical courses were already offered as electives because there was a local need and students enrolled (or were enrolled.) In others, *Smith-Hughes* and Perkins offered funds to expand what as already offered. The Act also contributed to the rise of guidance/career counseling in schools but again, it's voluntary. That is, students who got ""mortician"" on a career placement or proclivity test were not required to enroll in mortician school. 

After all of that, let's take a closer look at your question. First, vocational education at the high school level is still going strong. The Vocational Industrial Clubs of America Inc. (VICA), now known as SkillsUSA was founded in 1965 and supports thousands of high schoolers across the country to develop workforce skills. In addition, more than 30 states have created intermediary educational agencies to offer vocational and career training to students, taking the burden off of local school districts. In many cases, students attend their local high school for half day and then their vocational training in the afternoon, often graduating with both their HS diploma and a trades certification. One of the challenges is that when VICA was founded, it was possible to go right from HS to a well-paying job as the HS diploma was all that was needed for professional employment. In the modern era, a Bachelors degree is generally expected, meaning college has become more then norm for professional, technical jobs.

Regarding those stand-alone tech courses - this is where local decisions really matter. Some state still require FACS and some form of tech courses. However, in many cases ""shop"" has become computers, coding, 3D printing, etc. etc. In some places, administrators made the decision to cut the course - perhaps due to low enrollment - and use the classroom for something else. The basic gist, and answer to your question, is that technical and vocational courses at every high school in America has its own history."
AskHistorians,"In the movie ""The Lighthouse"" Willam Dafoe's character asks ""yer fond of me lobster"" to Robert Pattionson's character, after the latter complains about the food and wants a steak. What was food for like for late 19th century lighthouse workers ? Was there access to food like Steak or Lobster ?","I’m goning to talk about lobster because that’s what I am best prepared to answer. It’s worth noting that, until the early 20th century, lobster was considered poor people food. Children would be embarrassed to bring lobster to school for lunch because of the association. It was considered cruel and unusual punishment to feed convicts with lobster. Lobster in the late 19th century Northeast would have been abundant, cheap, and widely available, but the social equivalent of government cheese in the present day. Willem Dafoe’s character would probably have had to subsist on lobster as a cheap and readily available source of food in the New England maritimes when most of their rations would have been non-perishables like hardtack and some occasional salted pork and dried fruits or nuts. Canning was a pretty big industry in Maine at the time so a lot of it would have been canned. They only fresh food they got would have been what they caught themselves. Lobster have to be carefully managed nowadays to prevent overfishing, but they were abundant back then due to a relative lack of demand outside New England and the Canadian Maritimes.

This all changed in the early 20th century when wealthy New Yorkers and New Englanders from industrial centers started vacationing in Maine and the Maritimes for their mild summers and access to forests and the ocean. People like the Rockefellers started keeping houses on the Maine coast. They also wanted a truly Maine experience when they were there, and various boosters and restaurant owners decided to con them by selling lobster as a unique Northeast delicacy. They succeeded beyond their wildest dreams! These early billionaires and millionaires acquired a taste for it and the demand for lobster around the world exploded as the global elite attempted to emulate them.

AskHistorians,"How did pre-historic humans, or even uncontacted peoples today survive without salt in their food?","Dirt!

(I’m only halfway joking!)

Actually, I’m not joking at all!

Let’s take a look at our food chain. Assuming that our humans were inland and nowhere near an ocean, that would mean that the animals they hunted were nowhere near an ocean, either. Whether you eat animals and they eat plants, or you just eat the plants, the question is the same: where does salt come from if not from the ocean?

We all know about rock salt, which is generally mined in the remnants of some ancient inland sea. But the answer is twofold: first, there’s salt in dirt. Second: humans don’t actually need salt.

Back to dirt…

Dirt is essentially made up of two things: rocks (just ground up teeny tiny small) and organic matter (all the decomposing and living things in there). Sodium (not salt) is an element of almost every igneous rock. And as rocks grind together over time, the tiniest ones get pushed up and weathered away to become dirt. 

Ancient humans most likely dealt with (and ate) a lot more dirt than we do now. But additionally, the sodium in that soil was often passed into the plants. Certain plants absorb more sodium than others, including beets, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and most varieties mustard greens. 

But that brings me to the second point: we don’t need salt (NaCl). We need sodium. And we need potassium, too. It just so happens that one of the most abundant sources of dietary sodium, and the easiest to transport, and one that’s stable and safe for us to consume, happens to be sodium chloride."

AskHistorians,How did the use of the Konami Code by Allied soldiers in World War II help them win the war?,"The Konami Code was the essential backbone of the Allied counter-offensive in the Pacific.  Fighting back against an incredibly wide-ranging Japanese offensive that saw the establishment of a line of control from the Atleutian Islands to New Guinea meant that the US was forced to adapt a complex, coalition-based approach that drew on Allied forces scattered around the region, including many (like the remnants of Dutch forces in the Dutch East Indies) with a limited grasp of English. The simple pictogram based code allowed for the wide transmission of the Allied strategy and therefore the successful coordination of forces.

The plan was simple enough, and went as follows:

An attack staged **UP** from Australia against the Japanese fleet threatening Port Moresby at the Battle of the Coral Sea.

A further naval counterattack **UP** towards Midway, and the crippling of the Japanese carrier fleet.

**DOWN** towards the Solomon Islands, first taking Florida and then finally even further **DOWN** to capture all of Guadacanal.

**LEFT** to attack the Gilbert Islands and the bloody amphibious assault on Tarawa in November 1943.

**RIGHT** back to Pearl Harbour to refit and resupply ahead of the major 1944 offensives.

Then back **LEFT** to the Battle of Biak in New Guinea in May 1944, pivoting **RIGHT** to Saipan in June.

Then, of course, the iconic **B**attle of Iwo Jima, followed up by dropping an **A**\-bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This of course marked the end of the war, but also the **START** of the Cold War.

The Phillipines was a bit of a sideshow to all this, serving as a distraction from inputting the key winning strategy."
AskHistorians,"France, Germany, and Japan all had some form of “brown baby” program designed to place mixed-race offspring of Black American soldiers with Black families in the US. Why did the creators of this policy assume America was the best place for mixed-race children given that Jim Crow was in full swing?","I don't think it was quite as organized as you seem to imply. It certainly wasn't a government policy in Germany.

There is the story of [Mabel Grammer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/obituaries/mabel-grammer-overlooked.html), who adopted 12 mixed-race kids and found homes for 500 more. However, this wasn't a government program to get rid of mixed-race children: she was working *on behalf* of African-American couples who were looking to adopt, or whom she had convinced to adopt. 

At that time (1945-1955), there were about 5,000 babies born to African-American fathers and German mothers. Though many of the German mothers wanted to keep their child, this was the 40s and 50s: it was incredibly difficult for an unmarried mother with a baby out of wedlock to provide a caring home for her child. The law was not in their favor: the child's legal status was complicated, doubly so if the child was partially American. 

'Brown' babies in particular had many stigmas against them. For one, they were a clear visual reminder of the utter defeat of Germany in the war, and it was thought that the German public would be very hostile to them for their whole life because of this. It was feared that if Germany were to ever descend back into National-Socialism, that these babies would face heavy discrimination, and some even suggested they would suffer a similar fate to the Jews. In hindsight these fears proved overblown, but they were genuine at the time.

There was also racism: it was assumed these children would not integrate well into German society because of their 'racial peculiarities'; i.e., ""inferior intelligence, an impetuous temperament, and precociousness"". What didn't help was the strict anti-miscegenation laws enacted in most US states at the time: black Americans were not allowed to marry their German girlfriends, nor take them and their child back home to the US, since 'a marriage of a Negro and a white foreign person would create a social problem upon return to the United States' according to the Office of the Chief of Staff in August 1945.

So sadly, many of these children were sent to orphanages or given up for adoption to German adoption agencies. Mabel Grammer noticed this, and wrote many articles for the *Afro-American*, a Baltimore newspaper, urging African-American couples to adopt these orphans or unwanted children. These articles would be picked up by other northern newspapers with a large African-American audience, such as the *Pittsburgh Courier*. She maneuvered through the red tape, managing to find homes for 500 children, even though international adoption laws were in their infancy.

Her 'Brown Baby Plan' was not without its criticism. German social services felt that Grammer was not experienced enough in child welfare to oversee adoptions. In the United States (as you point out) Jim Crow laws were in full swing, and African-Americans from the north criticized Grammer's efforts to import babies from foreign countries rather than take them from the Jim Crow south.

So in answer to your question, this was a movement that concentrated in the north, not the Jim Crow south. The creators of this policy were the African-American inhabitants of these cities themselves, not the government. And they thought it was a better place for these children because of the harsh out-of-wedlock laws in Germany and anti-miscegenation laws in the US, racist expectation that they would never be integrated due to 'racial peculiarities', the fear of a resurgence of national-socialism, and the efforts of one specific woman, Mabel Grammer.

I can definitely recommend reading the first article in my source list below for further reading!

As to your question about France and Japan, I have not found any evidence for similar movements in those countries in my (admittedly quite cursory) search.

AskHistorians,"West Virginia is one of the poorest states in the US today, and most people tend to point at the coal industry leaving as one of the main drivers. Generally speaking, what was life in West Virginia like before coal went away, during its ""prime?"" Did it ever have a ""prime?""","Part I -- General answers.

This is a wide ranging question and I'll answer it in parts.  As long as it is, I'm sure it will be incomplete.

Defining ""prime"" is tricky.  If profit is the definition of prime, than anytime between the late 1800s and the early 1970s could be considered prime.  If broad miner employment and increasing prosperity as opposed to owner profits are taken into consideration in defining prime, then the period is much shorter and more or less confined to a period between the 50s and the early 70s.  Even then, prosperity for some was mixed with poverty in other areas. 

Industries that were prosperous:

* Tourism: Webster Springs was a popular tourist destination from the 1800s until 1925 when the hotel burned down.  The springs were frequented by travelers from the east including politicians from DC.  White Sulphur Springs was also a resort during this time period and remained a popular tourist destination for decades afterward-[-including housing a secret bunker under the Greenbrier Hotel to house congress in case of war](https://www.greenbrier.com/About-Us/History.aspx). In the 1970s ski resorts began to open in WV.
* Handmade Glass. Handmade Glass was profitable until the 1980s when it began to decline as a result of pressure from overseas handmade glass and high quality machine made glass.  Weston had both Louis Glass and WV Glass.  Currently Blenko Glass is the only glass factory in the state and it is struggling.  Small artisan producers like Ron Hinkle (former CEO at Blenko) are phasing out as well at this point.
*  Salt, Chemicals, and Metals. The Kanawha Valley grew from salt production and coal mining to become a chemical manufacturing area in the early 1900s.  Dupont and Union Carbide* both had extensive factory complexes in the area which, again declined in the 1980s as production was moved overseas.  Dupont also had a plant in Parkersburg.  Huntington had alloy factories. 
* Coal--coal has been a driver of WV economy since before becoming a state.  I'll cover coal in a subsequent comment, because there's a lot to say.

What did people do for leisure?  Well--without a specific time period, that varies.
Here are some answers--but the list is not complete.

* Outdoor activities--fishing, hunting, water sports, camping, gardening.  West Virginia has an abundance of rivers and man made lakes
* Baseball was popular in coal camps of the early 1900s
* Despite adopting prohibition early in WV with the Yost Law in 1914, drinking and saloons remained popular--and so moonshine and bootlegging culture expanded.
*   Roxie Cooper reports that during her childhood and teens in the early nineteen hundreds, that gatherings to sing around pianos were common and Dobe and Mag Glass relate the same of the late 1930s.
* Many of the same activities that were popular in any given time period were also popular in West Virginia.  
* You will find sports fields in most communities and this has been true for the last century.

As far as income--how much money did citizens make?  Census data and historical reports show that West Virginia, even in its most prosperous times, lagged behind the majority of the nation.  However, some jobs during some periods paid quite well.  This would include factory and mining jobs in the 60s and early 70s.

Was there any time when the state was top of the nation for some metric?  I'll save this answer for the second comment focusing on coal.

To be continued. I'll put sources in my last comment.

If you need a preview of some of the sources in the meantime, I have many of them[ posted here](https://bullpushhollow.com/a-partial-list-of-sources/) on [my historical graphic novel site.](https://bullpushhollow.com/prologue/)

AskHistorians,How did ancient Egypt collapse? Why isn’t it talked about as often as Ancient Rome?,"For most of its history, Egypt was ruled by indigenous kings. There were some periods of disruption earlier in Egyptian history, but from the 8th century BCE onward, Egypt was increasingly subject to pressures from outside.

Between mid-7th and mid-6th centuries BCE, Egypt was wholly or partly incorporated into the Kushite kingdom of the middle Nile, and the Kushite kings ruled Egypt as the 25th dynasty. In 670, Egypt was invaded by the Assyrian Empire, and over the next several years the Assyrians conquered the Nile valley, but in 664 a rebellion began in Egypt, led by Psammetichus, an Egyptian noble. 

Psammetichus founded the 26th dynasty, which ruled Egypt and preserved its independence until 525 BCE, when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Persian Empire under Cambyses II. The Persian Empire laid claim to Egypt for the rest of its history until it was conquered by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE, but Egypt was a restless province, and Persia faced numerous rebellions there. Some of these succeeded in pushing Persian control out of the country for some time. The last of these rebellions began in 411 or 410 BCE  and bore fruit in 404 with the establishment of a new indigenous dynasty under Amyrtaeus. Egypt fended off Persian reconquest until 343 BCE, when it was retaken by the Persians. From 343 onward, Egypt was ruled by Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Plamyrenes, Byzantines, and Arabs, but, during antiquity, it was not an independent state ruled by native leaders again.

There are two important differences between the end of the Egyptian kingdom and the end of the western Roman Empire. 

First, we can attach the end of Egypt as an independent, indigenous-ruled nation to a specific date and event. The Persian reconquest of Egypt in 343 ended the existence of Egypt as an independent state completely and decisively. The western Roman Empire, by contrast, disintegrated gradually and piecemeal; there is no decisive turning point at which it ceased to exist as a political entity. 

Second, despite the change of leadership, life at ground level in Egypt was very little changed. Foreign rulers who conquered Egypt, from the Kushites to the Romans, left a lot of the local administration in place and more often negotiated a working relationship with indigenous systems rather than try to replace them. 343 was decisive for the top level of leadership in Egypt, but the daily life of most Egyptians was barely any different afterwards than it had been decades or centuries before. In Rome, the end of the western Empire was marked by enormous changes in local economies and social structures. These changes played out gradually over time rather than happening all at once, but the social and economic world of western Europe in 500 CE was dramatically different from what it had been in 200 CE."
AskHistorians,"Today we have vegan products for people who don't want to exploit animals. In periods of history in places with widespread slave labor, were there products for people who didn't want to support slaver owners?","Yes, in fact, there are even [multiple sugar bowls](https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/artifact/sugar-bowl-inscribed-east-india-sugar-produce-of-free-labour) in [British museums](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/history-of-boycotts-slavery) which advertise that their contents are slavery-free. The owners of these bowls were buying ""free-labour sugar,"" a category created by East Indian importers attempting to capitalize on growing awareness of the horrors of slavery among educated British consumers. Sugar was the most prominent part of the ""free-produce movement"" which was most visible in Britain and the United States.

After African missionaries circulated initial reports about the slave labor behind sugar in the 1790s, some consumers desisted from sugar entirely -- ""anti-saccharites"", mostly fervent Christians such as Quakers. As a few East India importers began bringing slavery-free sugar to Britain, anti-slavery societies became their free marketing teams, widely distributing pamphlets such as *""What Does Your Sugar Cost?"" A Cottage Conversation on the Subject of British Negro Slavery*. Meanwhile, in America, the free-produce movement was led by black women, who encouraged their segregated groceries to buy only slavery-free goods.

The bind that free Black Americans faced in sourcing their food and raw materials was especially harsh. They were forced to buy ""ethical"" expensive cotton from white farmers instead of black slaves, which frustrated those trying to support black businesses. They sought coffee from Liberia and Haiti, hoping that the majority black demographics of these countries would support black uplift and prevent slave labor, and these created natural (and, indeed, slavery-free) coffee industries in those countries which indeed persisted for some decades.

The most surprising part of this story comes in the 1840s. After abolishing slavery in 1836, Britain had placed tariffs on slave-produced sugar in order to ensure fairness for British sugar producers who paid their laborers. This inflated sugar prices generally. Without tariffs, ""free-labour sugar"" would cost three times as much as its competition, defeating the East Indian importers' argument that slavery was a corrupt process which artificially inflated prices. It soon became clear that the writing was on the wall. In 1845, the primary importer of ""free-labour sugar"" exited the sugar market, and the following year, Britain decided to remove all the tariffs, for the benefit of consumers. Free-labour sugar completely vanished as a category thereafter.

Meanwhile in the United States, abolitionists criticized the free-produce movement as ineffective; similar to ""free-labour sugar"", it only placed an extra economic burden on those struggling to live ethically. It was recognized on both sides of the Atlantic that making individual consumer choices was not enough, and that systemic change was necessary to permanently eliminate slavery. As a status symbol, though, ""free cotton made by escaped slaves"" continued to be worn in Britain and attracted comment in aristocratic salons into the 1860s. In this final stage of the movement, free labor was considered to be part of a civilizing project, a way to train ex-slaves in useful arts.

AskHistorians,By the fifth episode of Band of Brothers they have a wide assortment of weapons. Is this accurate?,"The assignment of weapons depended on rank as well as role within their platoons. Typically, M1A1 Thompsons were given to NCOs or even commissioned officers. In BoB episode 2, Sgt. William Guarnere is shown with his Thompson submachine gun. He carries this weapon up until the Battle of the Bulge when he is maimed by artillery fire.

Donald Malarkey, made Sgt. by 1945, is in a mortar squad and carries an M1 Carbine with the standard paratrooper folding stock. He is shown using this weapon throughout the series. Mortar troops also had to carry heavy mortar parts, so carrying a lighter carbine type weapon makes sense for them. Similarly, 1st Sgt. Carwood Lipton (later earning a battlefield commission) carries an M1 Carbine from D-Day onward. 

LT. Buck Compton, a commissioned officer, carries the Thompson submachine gun, and is shown using it in action as early as the Brécourt Manor assault in episode 3. 

LT. Winters (later made Major) carried an M1 Garand, probably out of preference. According to John McManus *The Deadly Brotherhood* weapon swaps did occur amongst infantry troops (though this was not the case for Winters).

M1919 Machine Guns were assigned to special weapons squads (specifically machine gun squads) and were carried by multiple soldiers. One lugged the receiver and barrel, another carried the bipod or tripod and ammunition belts, and others carried spare ammo.

The Browning Automatic Rifle wasn’t typically assigned to paratroopers during D-Day as they were heavy and cumbersome. By Market Garden, this was re-thought and troops in rifle squads were issued the BAR. Similarly, the M3 Grease Gun was created as a cheaper replacement for the M1A1 Thomson submachine gun (which was, itself, a cheaper replacement of the M1928 Thompson). The Thompson was never actually phased out, but Airborne troops were issued the Grease Gun by September 1944 (while others were still being issued or carrying M1A1 Thompsons).

Also, some troops carried Bazookas and spare rockets  as well as their own personal weapons (probably carrying M1 Carbines or Thompsons) as shown during the Battle of Hill 30 (otherwise known as Bloody Gulch) just after the Carentan counteroffensive by the 6th Fallschirmjager and 17th SS."
AskHistorians,What did sailing vessels do at night in the ocean?,"A night crew takes over. There is a whole system of bells used during watch turnover time. Different time periods, cultures and countries had different systems, and it differed depending on whether the sailing ship was a naval vessel or a commercial one, but normally 8 bells meant the end of a four hour watch. The night crew working during some of the day and had rest during some of the daylight hours. Sometimes it would rotate who was on night watch so that the crew didn't have to do it each night but perhaps ever 3 or 4 nights. 

For each watch you had men to work up in the rigging to pull in or let out on the different sails. You had a helmsman and a lee helm who would rotate steering the ship, a quartermaster who could put down fixes on the chart, then you had the officer of the watch who was in charge while the captain was resting or doing something else. If they were getting accurate fixes, at the end of each watch the QM or watch officer would count up how many miles the ship did and divide it by four to get the speed made good for that watch. If it was overcast and the ship was making an oceans crossing (i.e. out of sight of land) then celestial navigation could not be performed and they had to use dead reckoning to guess the position. 

If something out of the ordinary happened like a fire or night time battle then general quarters was called and all the men were roused to deal with the emergency or fire cannons.

Then other people worked during the day like able bodied seamen, the carpenter, the bosun or boatswain, cooper, purser, etc. Some cooks, the steward and people who washed the plates would work during the day and if there was a baker he would get up early and bake bread, otherwise one of the cooks would do it. The steward was further responsible to count up how much food there was and how long it would last.

Regarding anchor, you are correct that the ship couldn't anchor in deep parts of the ocean. Even modern ships today have an anchor chain that is perhaps 11 to 14 shots which is only 1,300 feet or 400 meters. This anchor cannot be used in the open ocean but is meant to be used in more shallow water, such as outside a port while waiting to go in. As far as drifting goes, that's certainly an option but at least someone would need to be kept awake to make sure the ship doesn't hit into anything while it's drifting and to make rounds in case a fire or leak happened while everyone else was asleep. It was more the norm to keep the ship moving 24/7. On a commercial ship the owner or cargo interest would not want to stop the ship at night because time is money and the ship needs to move to it's destination to keep the cargo moving."

AskHistorians,"On the topic of dragons, I once heard that Marco Polo reportedly wrote about seeing dragons kept as pets in China. does anyone have any information about this? is it possible there was a kimono dragon type of some kind that has long been extinct and forgotten?","Marco Polo is a very tricky figure.

*If* Polo was referring to something real in China in the 14th century that was dragon like, he possibly was referring to Chinese Alligators. Chinese alligators are *Alligator sinensis*, the other species in the genus besides the American Alligator, *Alligator mississippiensis*. Chinese alligators are quite a bit smaller than their American cousins, and historically their range was restricted to the Yangtze River valley. Because of habitat loss (the type of wetlands they live in tend to get used for rice agriculture) it is critically endangered, with some 300 left in the wild. 

Polo's description is as follows from Chapter XL of the Thomas Wright translation (""On the province of Karazan""):

>""Here are seen huge serpents, ten paces in length, and ten spans in the girt of the body. At the fore−part, near the head, they have two short legs, having three claws like those of a tiger, with eyes larger than a fourpenny loaf (pane da quattro denari) and very glaring. The jaws are wide enough to swallow a man, the teeth are large and sharp, and their whole appearance is so formidable, that neither man, nor any kind of animal, can approach them without terror.""

Polo then mentions how these ""serpents"" live in caverns, and drag themselves to bodies of water (""to drink""). Polo then gives a very detailed account of how they were supposedly hunted, the medicinal uses of its gall bladder, how highly esteemed the meat was, and then...moves on to horses. No mention of pets that I see. 

Also interestingly at least in this translation they're not specifically called dragons either: when the term is used it's in reference to the creature in Chinese art and the Zodiac. Wright (and other historians) seem pretty convinced that this description here is of the Chinese alligator, however. 

But I should caution that we can't really be sure *exactly* that Polo is referring to a local wildlife species because Polo not only was rather infamous for his exaggerations (such as claiming Hanzhou had 12,000 bridges, unlike it's actual 350 or so), but because as a Medieval European he also plugged in mythical animal tropes to his accounts. And when I say ""he"" I should clarify it's really a ""they"" - while the *Travels of Marco Polo* might have been based on manuscripts and travel logs written by Polo, this work isn't the latter thing - it uses such supposed sources to write the travel book, and Polo worked closely with romance writer Rustichello da Pisa to write the *Travels*. Occasionally the narrative flips from the first person to the third person, even, and Rustichello absolutely spiced up the narrative, adding mentions of men with tails in Sumatra and men with the heads of dogs in the Andamans. Stories of dog headed people (in India) date back to Ancient Greek writers and are a very old trope.

AskHistorians,"The top-selling single of 1966 did not belong to Bob Dylan, The Beatles, or Simon & Garfunkel, but to Barry Sadler, whose “Ballad of the Green Berets” sold more than 9 million copies. How did that happen?!","I thought I would take my post of a few years ago that /u/hokori616 found, and repost it here for readers’ convenience:

‘The Ballad of the Green Berets' was clearly out of step with pop music's culture in 1966, the year 'Paint It Black' by the Rolling Stones and 'Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys got to #1. But then the big singles often do come from outside of pop music culture. The group of people who were 'in' the culture of pop music at any one time is relatively small; they're usually young and experimenting with their identities. There is, and always has been, a much larger audience for singles amongst people who *don't* keep up with the times (i.e., adults, who often have more disposable income than teenagers), but the problem is often getting people in this much larger audience to realise that the song exists. For the likes of 'My Heart Will Go On' by Celine Dion or 'Everything I Do (I Do It For You)' by Bryan Adams, the song was the theme of a movie (and so guaranteed getting heard by people who otherwise would not be that interested in the flow of pop music trends.) Elton John's 'Candle In The Wind '97', a charity single associated with the death of Princess Diana, benefited from the outpouring of sentiment after her passing. (2023 edit: And these three examples were from the 1990s but there’s more modern examples too: Kate Bush’s ‘Running Up That Hill’ doing very well thanks to *Stranger Things*, which has relatively little to do with current pop trends.) So at a basic level, 'The Ballad of the Green Berets' was one of these songs - not really 'with it' in terms of pop music in 1966 (the year psychedelia really exploded into American pop culture). And it *was* one of these songs - it was the best selling single of the year.

More specifically, the Green Berets (the US Army Special Forces) had been lionised in American culture in the mid-1960s, and 'The Ballad of the Green Berets' was part of this; in 1965 (while Barry Sadler was in Vietnam with the Special Forces) an (almost) best-selling book was published - Robin Moore's *The Green Berets* which claimed (in its introduction) to be 'a book of truth'. In 1968 the book was turned into a strongly pro-military film co-directed by and starring John Wayne. Sadler was injured in Vietnam, and needed to be flown out for medical treatment. During Sadler's convalescence, he made a demo of a song called 'Ballad of the Green Beret' which generated some interest from publishers; Sadler continued to record demos of his songs. Robin Moore met Sadler, and worked on a revision of 'Ballad Of The Green Beret' with an extra verse, now called 'Ballad Of The Green Berets' (to ape the title of the book).

Recorded in December 1965, the song became a hit in early 1966, and it was widely seen as a rebuke to anti-war songs like Barry McGuire's 1965 'Eve Of Destruction'. In terms of its success, Roger Landes argues in a chapter of the edited book *The Vietnam War In Popular Culture* titled 'Sgt Barry Sadler and the Ballad of the Green Berets' that Sadler had a few things going for him. Firstly, he was a serving Green Beret who had suffered an injury in service, which gave his song a powerful ring of authenticity (something that was not shared by the pro-war country songs of the era, which were relatively common but did not translate into wider pop culture). Secondly, 'The Ballad Of The Green Berets' was released a couple of months after the Battle of Ia Drang, the first big engagement between American troops and the North Vietnamese army, where hundreds of American soldiers died (Sadler himself was in convalescence before this battle). Sadler thus rode a wave of patriotism in popular culture which was spurred on by the shock of this battle to the American public; Landes compares the effect of these deaths to the effect of the death of John F. Kennedy. 'The Ballad of the Green Berets' also wasn't 'pro-Vietnam war' in its message, per se, but was 'pro-soldier', which was perhaps easier to sell to the American public. Thirdly, Sadler's record company RCA could smell the wind of late 1965/early 1966, and so they put a bunch of resources into promoting and publicising the song, helped by the US Army's marketing team, which too saw the song as a golden publicity opportunity, and which made sure Sadler was available for the promotional opportunities that RCA could offer.

Landes also makes the point that the success of Sadler was very short-lived. 'The Ballad Of The Green Berets' was of a particular moment: as Ia Drang faded from memory, so did 'The Ballad of the Green Berets'.

In terms of negative reaction from those who were against the war, the pro-soldier nature of the lyrics, which didn't voice any specific pro-Vietnam War sentiment, diffused this to a great extent; the song was seemingly interpreted more universally as being about war rather than being about a specific war. The teen fortnightly magazine *KRLA Beat* in April 1966 ran a 'teen panel discussion' on the topic of 'Ballad of the Green Berets' (which is also a reminder that, despite the song having a wider appeal than most pop music of the era beyond the usual teenage baby boomer audience, that it was still something that was consumed by teenagers). There are some interesting quotes from teens in this article, who KRLA Beat implies were anonymised:

>	BILL - [one trend] creates the next. After all that 'down with war' stuff, the time was perfect for songs like 'Green Beret'. We were just ready to be exposed to the other side of the story. Ready psychologically. I think a lot of teenagers bought 'Green Beret' because they felt guilty about going along with the protest idea. After all, there is a war going on.

>	JOANNE - ...I don't think 'Green Beret' is nearly as patriotic as a lot of the protest songs. Those songs were against destruction. 'Green Beret' almost sounded like it was *for* it. In my opinion, it's far more patriotic to want to learn how to live than it is to want to learn how to destroy life.""

>	MARI - That's ridiculous! 'Green Beret' was a hundred times better than any protest song could ever be, and I'm really proud of kids for coming to their senses. How can you say that song was *for* destruction? It encouraged people to stand behind their fighting men, and it encouraged those men to be better soldiers.

>	PAUL - You've got to be kidding. That song sounded like a Madison Avenue advertising campaign to promote war. It made being 'tranined in combat hand to hand' sound glamorous! And that part about pinning wings on his son's chest. If it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't have been offended by the song. But that did it. No responsible parent would wish that kind of future on a child...

(skipping to later in the panel discussion...)

>	MARI - ...I never stopped to think that it really *is* the same kids. The one who bought protest songs are buying things like 'Green Beret' now. I don't think it's because they feel guilty. I think it's just because they're willing to listen to both sides. Adults could learn a few lessons from teenagers.

Clearly the members of the baby boomer generation that made up this panel discussion show a range of political ideologies. Mari is clearly strongly in favour of the song, bu others say they were offended by it - more for its implications of glorifying violence than the Vietnam War itself, which none of the panel members ventures strong opinions about in particular."
AskHistorians,The Pacification of Scandinavia: how and when did these famously bellicose people become peaceful?,[removed]
AskHistorians,The Great Escape (1963) The prisoners and their captors were very cordial to one another. How was the atmosphere at a real Luftwaffe POW camp for an American airman?,"I haven't seen the movie, but *The Great Escape* is based on a true story (as you probably already knew) of an attempted escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan (today Żagań, Poland) that took place on the night of 24-25 March 1944. Stalag Lufts, as the name suggests, were camps for Allied airmen, which were operated by the Luftwaffe under the umbrella of the Wehrmacht Prisoner of War Agency (*Kriegsgefangenenwesen der Wehrmacht*). Unlike camps for army personnel, whose camps were separated between enlisted men's camps (*Kriegsgefangenenmannschaftsstammlager*, or Stalags) and officers' camps (*Offizierslager*, or Oflags), airmen of all ranks were held in Stalag Lufts. There were seven of these camps in total, numbered from I to VII; Stalag Luft III was numbered that way because it was located in Defense District (*Wehrkreis*) III, which was roughly contiguous with Pomerania. There were also at least two transit camps for Allied airmen, known as Dulag Lufts (Dulag is short for *Durchgangslager*, which means ""transit camp"").

Generally, the way the system worked was that captured airmen were sent through one of those Dulag Luft camps, where they were interrogated by their captors, who were obviously interested in information both about Allied aircraft and Allied bombing plans. Some prisoners reported that these interrogations were quite harsh, noting that their captors became angry when the prisoners asserted their rights under the Geneva Conventions of 1929, which stated that prisoners were only required to tell their captors their name, rank, and serial number, and forbade the detaining power from using force to attempt to extract further information from the prisoners. After they were processed in the Dulag Lufts, they were then sent to the Stalag Lufts.

The conditions in the Stalag Lufts were generally good. I should point out that Stalag Lufts primarily held Western Allied airmen; most Soviet airmen were sent to regular prisoner of war camps. There was a stark divide between the treatment of Western Allied prisoners of war, who were generally treated according to the conditions of the Geneva Conventions, and Soviet prisoners of war, who were subjected to a systematic program of mistreatment and mass murder in deliberate and flagrant violation of international law. Even in Stalags that held both Western Allied and Soviet prisoners of war, this distinction in treatment was maintained. The national makeup of the prisoner populations in the Stalag Lufts were thus decisive in dictating the conditions within the camps.

As I said, I haven't seen the movie, but based on your description, it seems like a realistic depiction of the conditions in camps like Stalag Luft III. Prisoners in these camps weren't required to perform forced labor, which gave them a lot of free time. During this time, they organized educational courses and created a variety of cultural activities, including musical groups and theatre troupes. The prisoners also organized sports activities and other hobbies, like the gardens you noted, which supplemented their regular rations. Most of the resources for these activities came from the Red Cross and the YMCA based on request from prisoners. The Red Cross also supplied the prisoners with food parcels, which contained luxury items like chocolate and cigarettes (these packages were also sent to Western Allied prisoners in other prisoner of war camps, but again, not to Soviet prisoners).

Relations between prisoners and guards in these camps were also relatively good, generally speaking. There are a few reasons for this, but among the most notable is that these camps had smaller numbers of prisoners and were generally staffed by older German soldiers. Prisoners in these camps made hassling the guards and attempting escapes into pastimes (the right of prisoners to attempt to escape was guaranteed by the Geneva Conventions in that prisoners could not be subjected to anything beyond standard camp punishments for attempting escape). The prisoners referred to their haranguing of the guards as ""goon-baiting""; the prisoners told the guards that ""goon"" was an acronym for ""German Officers Or Noncoms"", which is pretty funny.

Of course, Stalag Luft III was an infamous case of less-than-cordial relations between prisoners and guards in the form of the Stalag Luft III murders, which were committed as reprisals for the escape attempt that was dramatized in the film. I'm not going to go over the escape attempt itself since you presumably got the gist of it from the film, but suffice to say that most of the escapees were recaptured, and 50 British and Commonwealth airmen were executed in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Despite this, the camp's commandant at the time, Oberst Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, wasn't prosecuted even though he was taken as a prisoner of war by the British, and in fact testified at the trial of the perpetrators of the massacres after the war, because the senior prisoners in the camp went to bat for him. 18 others were tried for the murders in 1947, and 13 of the defendants were subsequently executed.

If you have other questions about the German POW camp system in general or Stalag Luft III in particular, I'd be happy to answer them. I've spent most of the last seven years working on this subject.

AskHistorians,"What is the origin of the ""Medieval people drank beer instead of water"" myth?","I have at least a _theory_ although not a smoking gun.

My first task was trying to find as old a book possible that gave the myth. Certainly this clip from 1947 gives a good example:

>During the Middle Ages it was considered much more healthful to drink alcoholic beverages (particularly wine) than water because the lack of hygiene
and adequate sewage disposal systems frequently resulted in pollution of water supplies, thereby subjecting large numbers of people to the danger of
typhus and other dread diseases. Many authorities claim that France's reputation as a big wine-drinking country stems from this medieval heritage.

(From _The Beverage Distilling Industry_ by Stanley Baar. And why, if this was true, would _only_ France get this reputation?)

I found a similar 1931 reference; jumping back a bit further to 1926, and at least
not a pop book (_Health, Wealth and Population in the Early Days of the Industrial Revolution_), I found the claim that ""inhabitants had not a high standard of cleanliness and had no knowledge of the dangers of pollution"". (Absolutely false: there were laws passed just to reduce water pollution.)

However, that got a fair tip on part of what was going on, and references I found going back to 1901 essentially have the same idea: that the ignorant folk of the medieval ages had little understanding of water purity, with at least the implication (explicit or implicit) that alcohol was as a replacement for water. Even glancing at a modern book of scholarship it is possible to see where this confusion might come from; for example, Unger's _Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance_ published by the University of Pennsylvania (2013) discusses how

>Drinking was a social activity looked on by people of the day with neither suspicion nor awe. The society did not know about alcoholism. The concept simply did not exist. People thought alcohol therapeutic and a normal part of life, that is except for the very poor. Excessive drinking did exist and was frowned on, but moralists complaining about overeating in the same sentences that they complained about too much alcohol.

A writer not paying attention could easily interpret this as ""they drank alcohol instead of water"". Of course, this paragraph is _not_ meant to imply they did not drink water; drinking a lot of alcohol does not exclude water, it just means they found drinking alcohol to be fun!

This kind of willful misreading can be seen in Salzman's book _English Industries of the Middle Ages_ (1913) which claims that ale was ""taking the place not only of such modern inventions as
tea and coffee, but also for water, insomuch that a thirteenth-century writer describing the extreme poverty of the Franciscans when they first settled in London (AD 1224) explains, ""I have seen the brothers drink ale so sour that some would have preferred to drink water.' Perhaps individually, on its own, the anecdote is suggestive, but the same primary source also talked about friars taking turns drinking the dregs of beer, and generally is meant to indicate _the Franciscans were poor and this is what they resorted to for alcohol_ and not _they simply refused to drink water_. This is additionally a single anecdote ignoring the vast evidence we have (attested by /u/DanKensington's many posts on the manner) that medieval people drank water plentifully.

I still felt like the story was incomplete. It is not surprising that people writing around the 1900s-early 1910s try to give themselves an aura of superiority over the past, the result of Progress; Whig History, which was all about how the present was glorious compared to the past, was having a last hurrah in this period. Still, why _this_ specific aspect of superiority? Consider this excerpt from _One Hundred Years of Brewing_ (1901):

>During the middle ages polluted water of bad odor (and even such polluted by dung pile sewerage) was frequently used, the impression being that the quality of the beer could not be affected as long as the water was boiled.

This is a very odd and specific myth, and it reminded me of something else. You see, during the actual middle ages, one of the most popular kinds of poem/songs was the ""debate poem"", where two opposing sides have at it; The Owl and the Nightingale, for instance, debate which is the better animal.

Wine and Water have their debates, and there are at least 10 extant poems/drinking songs that involve these substances in some way. The _Carmina Burana_ has one where the poet starts complaining about the mixture of water and wine, and then wine, insultingly, talks about water being stagnant and disease-ridden. It's important to note that this is **satire**, not to be taken as a serious characterization of water, just like the other poems in the _Carmina Burana_, which include an extended sexual encounter with Venus as well as a ""lazy order"" of monks who wake up late and gamble.

One of the other parody songs -- this one not from the _Carmina Burana_ which dates to the 11th/12th centuries, but in this case written in German in 1536 by Hans Sachs -- has, again, Wine and Water duke it out in battle, with Neptune and Bacchus in debate, Bacchus of course
endorsing wine's case. Water is referred to as dirty, specifically

>stinkend und trub wie ein misthul

which is something like ""stinky and filled with dung heap"".

The ""dung heap"" aspect from 1901 is not only not true, but not true in an exceedingly specific phrasing. This suggests somewhere in the late 19th century a satirical tale about water's diseased qualities was somehow interpreted as real history about water.

So to summarize:

a.) historians in the early-20th century that developed the tale had an exceptionalism which made them inclined to believe the ignorance of people in medieval times

b.) at least one historian probably picked up one of the ""debate songs"" meant as parody as giving a factual account"

AskHistorians,Where in the world did all the Spanish New World silver go?,"Peru and later Mexico were major sources of silver for the Spanish Empire, with Mexico remaining a major source of global silver after achieving independence.

American silver was predominantly minted in Silver Carolus coins, also referred to as the Spanish Dollar or ""piece of eight."" These coins were widely used and accepted in Europe, East Asia, and the Americas; and are sometimes referred to as the first globally accepted currency.

The Carolus enjoyed high market confidence from the sixteenth century into the 19th century. Maintaining known characteristics and a consistent silver content. Though there was a period of debasement during and after the wars of independence. But successor Mexican dollars regained much of this market confidence. US Department of Commerce publications from 1904 discussing China still gave many Chinese prices in ""Mexican dollars.""

After being mined and minted, this Silver entered general circulation as currency, circulating throughout the Europe and the world. Silver (like Gold, and some other metals) does have a somewhat unique status as both currency and valuable commodity in its own right. So some silver coins were constantly melted down to manufacture silver products or to be reminted into different coins.

A large amount of this currency ended up in China, as some 27% of global silver did during this period. This inflow monetized major Chinese economic growth between 1700-1820. Within China, despite being prized for its reliable silver content and known characteristics, Carolus were melted down at a steady rate to be reminted into silver Liang/sycee as certain taxes had to be paid in this form.

As to where is it all nowadays, it likely continues to circulate. Some likely preserved as Carolus coins, other parts now in the form of bullion, silver dinnerware, etc. Silver circulates and is melted down into new forms all the time. Asking where new world silver mined in 1545 is now is sort of like asking where the oxygen people were breathing in sixteenth century Peru is now.

I have discussed some of the interesting aspects of Chinese Carolus circulation and silver arbitrage [in a prior answer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/oabl7o/british_merchants_resorted_to_opium_trade_with/)"
AskHistorians,Was there a Russian version of McCarthy who led a charge to root out supposed capitalism sympathizers hiding in Soviet Russia?,"I won't really tread over already-covered ground by the other esteemed commenters, so I'll just add a few points.

The ""Great Purge(s)"" proper under Stalin are technically for the period 1936-1938. Although Stalin went through a number of phases of public persecution and prosecution of suspected enemies, this period in particular is of the highest intensity and most notoriety. This is the period in which the oppressive apparatus was turned directly on Party members, that prosecutions were pursued by ""troikas"" (extrajudicial committees usually run by the NKVD, or People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs), and saw some 2.5 million arrests, 700,000 executions, and the remainder dispatched to gulags. Most of these cases were prosecuted under Article 58 of RSFSR law, ie one that found ""counter-revolutionary activities"" to be a capital offense, and these purges also saw the major Moscow Show Trials of Soviet party and military leaders (there were three big, public, trials of party leaders and one secret trial of military officers).

Of course neither show trials nor these mass arrests and extrajudicial punishments originated with the Great Purges, nor were confined to them. Soviet Show Trials had gone back at least as far as the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries (the other, bigger socialist party in revolutionary Russia) in 1922, the Shakhty Trial of 1928 (which targeted ""bourgeois specialist"" engineers), and the Industrial Party Trial of 1930 (in which Soviet scientists and economists were accused of conspiring to overthrow the Soviet government through a mass ""wrecking"" of the Soviet economy). Likewise troikas and mass arrests had been used in the Dekulakization Campaign (which saw some 1.8 million ""kulak"" peasants deported), and would be used concurrently to the Great Purges proper in the ""National Operations"" of 1937-1938, which saw something like 100,000 Polish Soviet citizens executed and the entire Korean community deported from the Soviet Far East to Central Asia.

What made the Great Purge stand out was that it attacked Party members with Party members, and often several times over. An infamous example can be found in the leadership of the NKVD itself. It was originally headed by Genrikh Yagoda, who was arrested and shot by Nikolai Yezhov (who oversaw the most feverish phase of the purges in the ""Yezhovshchina""), who in turn was arrested and shot by Lavrentiy Beria (who for good measure was arrested and shot by his Party colleagues in the months after Stalin's death in 1953). It actually makes commemoration of the purges especially fraught because often many of the victims were *also* perpetrators - I have read of execution site monuments in recent years having big arguments over even how one lists the victims names when a significant number of the victims killed the others. 

Of course the repression continued during World War II, especially with mass arrests, deportations and executions from western territories annexed by the Soviets in 1939-1941 (the execution of some 20,000 Polish officers at Katyn being just one infamous example), and with the mass deportations of seven ""suspect"" nationalities during the war (including Volga Germans, Crimea Tatars and Chechens). Postwar repressions included the anti-Jewish ""Night of the Murdered Poets"", the anti-semitic campaign against ""rootless cosmopolitans"", the Doctor's Plot and a planned ""national campaign"" against Soviet Jews that didn't happen only because of Stalin's death. 

Altogether, maybe something like 14 million people passed through the gulag system, as I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tk94yc/comment/i1pclgq/), with maybe 1.5 million deaths resulting from that experience. The Soviets were looking for a wide variety of ""enemies"" (bourgeois specialists, wreckers, Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Right Deviationists, bourgeois nationalists, Socialist Revolutionaries, smugglers and economic criminals, priests, suspect enemy nationalities, even ""antisocial"" elements) during the period of Stalin's rule, although the groundwork had been laid before Stalin's leadership, and would continue in more indirect methods after Stalin's time.

In some ways McCarthy *also* was looking at a broad number of targets. He didn't particularly care if someone's socioeconomic policies were too leftist or not (he himself supposedly chose between his witchhunt and a campaign for universal pensions benefits for his senatorial re-election campaign). As I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dnzq3l/comment/f5lfvyf/), there already was a crackdown on US Communists (as in literal card carrying party members, especially the national leadership) and suspected Soviet spies, especially after the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the start of the Korean War. The House Un-American McCarthy was mostly interested in targeting political figures or demographics he didn't like for political gain, so actual Communist Party membership mattered less than someone being too Northeastern, or too connected to elite universities, or too homosexual, or even too mainline Protestant. It's also worth noting that while McCarthy certainly humiliated and professionally damaged a great number of people, his hunt never actually resulted in the arrest or conviction of anyone, especially not for espionage."

AskHistorians,Could you get water in old west saloons?,"In the Wild West you could NOT ask for a glass of water without being ridiculed or becoming involved in a barfight. Unfortunately, it was and is only possible to visit the Wild West in TV or movies (and earlier in dime novels).

In the real West, it was certainly possible to ask for water in all sorts of forms, and that would not be a problem. I was part of a team that excavated four saloons in the Virginia City National historic landmark District. The opportunity to compare artifacts from four different business was unprecedented and has not been matched in any other American community, so this gave me - and my team - a unique perspective. I wrote up the results in my memoir of the archaeology and material culture in the Landmark District in [Virginia City City: Secrets of a Western Past](https://www.amazon.com/Virginia-City-Historical-Archaeology-American/dp/0803238487/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=LtHOH&content-id=amzn1.sym.ed85217c-14c9-4aa0-b248-e47393e2ce12&pf_rd_p=ed85217c-14c9-4aa0-b248-e47393e2ce12&pf_rd_r=132-6688301-3692741&pd_rd_wg=fZDi9&pd_rd_r=68a7132a-de1a-43ec-a976-ee63b733ec53&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk) (2012), including observations about these saloons. Kelly Dixon, who directed two of the excavations, also published her enormously important study, [Boomtown Saloons: Archaeology And History In Virginia City](https://www.amazon.com/Boomtown-Saloons-Archaeology-Virginia-Shepperson/dp/0874177030/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CMXJPE09BTGU&keywords=Dixon+Boomtown+saloons&qid=1690712754&s=books&sprefix=dixon+boomtown+saloons%2Cstripbooks%2C90&sr=1-1) (2006), on this subject.

One of the more remarkable artifacts we found (among the roughly 350k artifacts from the four excavations) was [this carbon water filter](https://imgur.com/BeZrYII) found at John Piper's Old Corner Saloon. It was manufactured on Fleet Street in London and likely dates to the 1863 opening of the Old Corner at its new location after the first incarnation of the business burned earlier that year. This offered patrons not only a glass of water, but also a well filtered refreshing drink - from something not unlike a modern Brita water filter. I'm sure this was used in mixed drinks as well, but certainly someone could and people likely did have a refreshing glass of water on a hot day.

This was not the only evidence of drinking water that we found, however. Piper and his brothers were emigrants from the Germanies, and they imported a type of mineral water from Nassau, that by all accounts was an acquired taste. We found many of these bottles, indicating that some, at least, acquired the taste!

There were also a lot of bottles that pointed to the sale of bottled soda water. [This assorted of bottles](https://imgur.com/y54bCnc), presented as part of an exhibit on the archaeology, includes these bottles, for a proper saloon offered a wide variety of possible drinks, including water - carbonated, mineralized, and fresh. This exhibit, ""Havens in a Heartless World,"" which secured funding from the National Endowment of the Humanities, appears in a tragically truncated, [three-part online presentation, at this link](https://www.onlinenevada.org/exhibit-galleries).

The evidence from the archaeology, confirmed in a limited way by primary source records, points to a wide use of water in various forms in western saloons. This was not a peculiarity. It was something that was an expected option at these businesses.

AskHistorians,Are there things that historians collectively agree they WON'T ever publish about a historical figure?,"I'd agree with shaggy above in the sense that historians tend to not purposefully hide information about a person if it's important or relevant. 

However there are often some conditions that come with access to private material that can make that problematic. Papers that are held by families or other private organisations can have very strict access and copyright conditions that restrict what can be reproduced or published. There's one particular Australian officer from WW1 who is very important to the history of Australia in WW1 who has a very large collection of surviving papers held by his family. However, they haven't allowed historians to go over that collection in its entirety and there's a suspicion that there's some unflattering things in there. But without access and the family's permission there's not a lot that can be done.


There's also the question of time and privacy. How long should one wait before publishing something that could cause harm or reputational damage? Should that person be dead? Their children or grandchildren? Anyone who knew them personally? Most academic ethics policies have sections to deal with this question and a fair bit of thought goes into them. There isn't really a one size fits all answer as they're often on a case by case basis.

Your question asks about an important historical figure, but historians do sometimes have to weigh up the value of publishing potentially harmful or embarrassing information about someone who is just a regular person. If possible it's often anonymised to some degree, but if that isn't possible then it's up to the individual historian and their publishers ethics department. A colleague of mine has had to deal with some very angry descendants of soldiers after he found out some unsavoury facts about their ancestor, so there can be a real world impact from this."
AskHistorians,Why did Sephardic Jews keep speaking Spanish for 450 years?,"It is really no different than any diaspora group continuing to speak their language after immigrating. Since you know that Ashkenazim continue to speak Yiddish, you should understand that Sephardim continue(d) to speak Judeo-Spanish for the same reasons. Please know, also, that Ashkenazim continued to speak Yiddish – a Germanic language – long after leaving German-speaking lands. Yiddish was the daily language of Jews in places like Russia, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, Slovakia and Czechia, Hungary, and Romania for hundreds of years – and none of those places were primarily German-speaking.

They didn't ""revert"" to local languages like Arabic or Turkish because they generally had little cause to; within the Jewish community, the spoken language could easily remain Judeo-Spanish. However, many people were multi-lingual and spoke Judeo-Spanish and Turkish, for example. This was necessary for interactions with non-Jews, e.g. in business or bureaucracy. Similarly, Ashkenazi Jews were often multilingual as well – my great-grandfather, a Yiddish-speaker, also spoke Hungarian and Czech. And eventually English too. Imagine an Ashkenazi family whose ancestors lived in the Rhineland (a German-speaking area) but who ended up living in the Pale of Settlement, a region where Slavic – not Germanic – languages were spoken. Jews in that region retained Yiddish into the 20th century, despite not having lived in German-speaking areas since (in many cases) the 16th century or earlier. 

In addition to practical reasons for not having to relinquish one's first language, there are emotional and social reasons. Language – like food, music, dress, and other aspects of culture – is one way people retain and strengthen a common identity and cultural cohesion. And it enabled Sephardic Jews to communicate with other Sephardim who were not in the local community. A Moroccan Jew of Sephardic background and a Turkish Jew of Sephardic background living in the 19th century would both speak dialects of Judeo-Spanish, and this would enable them to communicate, despite Arabic and Turkish not being mutually intelligible. Their dialects of Judeo-Spanish might differ, but they'd be able to communicate in this way with greater ease. But we do see examples of multilingualism in Beauty Queen, too – Gavriel speaks Arabic when he travels to Lebanon, Roza speaks Turkish in the early episodes when engaging with the Ottoman bureacracy and soldiers, and many characters speak a little English.

I want to remind you, also, that although Hebrew was not revived as a vernacular language until the late 19th century, it was continually in use as a Jewish lingua franca since the early days of the diaspora (so, for thousands of years). We see this in several letters from the Cairo Geniza (a cache of Jewish documents, mostly medieval) where a Jewish community in southern France wrote to the Jewish community of Cairo, in Hebrew. These French Jews spoke Judeo-Provençal whereas the Egyptian Jews spoke Judeo-Arabic. Those two languages were not mutually intelligible, but Hebrew was understood by both. 

While the show you mention is really good, it also shouldn't be misconstrued as a work of history with complete accuracy. However, it seems clear that the use of Ladino by the characters in the show differs generationally. The older characters have more facility with the language – we can assume Mercada, for example, can speak it fluently – while the younger characters use it only occasionally, as individual words or phrases sprinkled in among the Hebrew they speak. Crucially, this is in large part so that the audience can understand the dialogue without having to read subtitles (and because the actors almost certainly don't actually speak much, if any, Ladino), but it also illustrates natural language loss over time."
AskHistorians,Why did the Manhattan project releases two vastly different bomb designs at the exact same time?,"**Short answer:** it's a coincidence — they happened to have the right amounts of fuel for both bomb types ready at nearly exactly the same time. They didn't know in advance this would happen, it just worked out that way, despite twists and turns that changed their production schedules and expectations of how much fuel they would use. They originally intended to use both kinds of fuel in the same bomb type, and only developed the implosion design when it became clear that was not possible.

**Very long and (IMO) more interesting answer:**

The Manhattan Project was started in 1942 with the goal of pursuing two different paths to making bomb fuel: enriched uranium and plutonium. The identification of these two paths, and the basic plans for how to make them, was worked out by previous US fission research efforts (the small-scale Uranium Committee, 1939-1941, and the more pilot-project-sized S-1 Committee, 1941-1942), and the Manhattan Project (1942-1946) was the production project that was going to put this into effect with the goal of making usable atomic bombs. The two fuels each required totally different processes to create, both of which were unprecedented to produce at industrial scales (again, they had only done small-scale and pilot-scale research on them at that point), so they didn't know if either or both would work within the constraints of time that they had. By pursuing both simultaneously and redundantly, they felt they had a better chance of being successful with at least one of them. Both, as it turned out, were successful, but not without their uncertainties and unexpected difficulties in production. 

They originally planned to use essentially the same weapon design for both fuels — the gun-type design, where a critical mass is created by shooting two subcritical pieces of fissile material together through the barrel of a gun. This was relatively simple and straightforward to conceptualize, to design, to do partial testing of, and to build. From the beginning, the considered that there would be probably more complicated and efficient alternatives, but given that _time_ was the main limiting factor they had — they had near unlimited money and technical talent, but initially believed (wrongly, it turned out) that they were in a race with Germany — they opted for simple and straightforward.

Or so they thought. In the summer of 1944, it was unpleasantly discovered that plutonium made in nuclear reactors (as opposed to particle accelerators, which is what they had based their initial assumptions on) inevitably had impurities that would make it impossible to use in a gun-design. So they very rapidly pivoted their design work from a plutonium gun-design to the far more difficult implosion design. A small team was assigned to making the uranium gun design, because it was a ""sure thing"" compared to the implosion design, which might not work at all (within the time constraints they had), and at the very least was expected to work not as well (it would not be as explosive, they thought).

Due to their differing methods of assembly and efficiency, the uranium gun design and the plutonium implosion design required very different amounts of fuel: 64 kg vs. 6.2 kg, respectively. The enriched uranium production facilities at Oak Ridge was designed to make about 1 kg of enriched uranium per day once it got fully running. However it didn't really hit that point of production until the summer of 1945. The plutonium production facilities at Hanford were planned to produce about 0.7 kg of plutonium per day, but also didn't get really up to speed until the early summer of 1945.

These production schedules were somewhat planned, but also subjected to unexpected delays and difficulties (at Oak Ridge, for example, they had originally expected that any one of the several methods they pursued would work completely, but none did, so they had to figure out a way to chain several methods together to get them to work; at Hanford, they had issues running the industrial-sized reactors and solving unanticipated problems like Xenon poisoning, in which the running of the chain reaction creates byproducts that inhibit the chain reactor). 

The consequence of all of this is that they had enough plutonium for one implosion bomb by mid-July 1945, which they used for the Trinity test. This is a little tangential to your question, but the Trinity test radically changed their outlook on implosion, because it turned out that plutonium implosion worked better than they had expected by a factor of 4 or so. So that was promising in and of itself, but it also changed the outlook on the use of the atomic bomb in the war quite a bit. Given the production schedules listed above, and the fuel requirements for each bomb design, they could produce one uranium gun bomb every two months, but three plutonium implosion bombs per month. Before Trinity, they thought that meant one ""big"" (15 kilotons or so) bomb every two months, with three ""small"" (maybe less than a kiloton, upwards of 5 kilotons) implosion bombs to use in between. But after Trinity it was made clear that the gun bomb was the smaller of the two: the Trinity test was around 20 kilotons. So now they really had 3.5 bombs of a suitably large size per month. 

So it was an accident of fate that they ended up with a gun-type bomb's worth of enriched uranium, and one more implosion design's worth of plutonium, ready by the end of July 1945. It really was quite down to the wire; they had about 60% of it to put on a boat to Tinian by mid-July, and then flew the other 40% there on several planes on July 26. The plutonium core for the implosion bomb was shipped by plane on July 26 as well. As it worked out, the fuel on the ship arrived on July 26, and the flown fuel arrived by July 28 and July 29. By July 31, they had completed assembly of the combat unit for the Little Boy gun-type bomb. The plan was to use it around August 3rd (after the Potsdam Conference had ended), but the weather forecast delayed it to August 6th. The plan had been to drop Fat Man implosion bomb on August 10th, but the weather forecast caused them to accelerate the (complicated) job of assembling the device so they could drop it on August 9th. So aside from the coincidence in fuel production that led them to have two types of atomic bombs ready at nearly the same time, weather conditions compressed the time between the use of the bombs even more than had been planned for."

AskHistorians,Why did Phillip II choose to make Madrid the capital of Spain in 1561?,"There were a number of relevant factors into it.

The centrality of Madrid. Being right in the utter middle of Spain, or being Spain's yolk as Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo would say, meant it was not unreasonably far from any of the important ports like Valencia, Santander, Bilbao, Sevilla, or Barcelona. It was rather far from all of them, but news could get from any of those places in acceptsble time. If the royal court was in Barcelona, news from Seville or Coruña may get a bit too late, if the court was in Seville, news from Bilbao or Santander get later than they should, etc. 

Being of royal jurisdiction was another important factor. The royal court being in a city or town where the King did not have control would undermine the monarch's authority, so Toledo gets ruled out as the city was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Toledo, who was quite a big magnate lording over 50 towns and over 200 villages. Furthermore, Madrid already had a perfectly suitable royal palace, the Alcázar de Madrid, sadly lost to a fire in the early 18th century, which stood where today is the Royal Palace.

Lack of strong local oligarchies. Wanting to start a new period abandoning his father's itinerant style, settling in a place with already powerful and strong local oligarchies would be ill-advised. Seville, Valencia, Burgos, and Valladolid had really powerful local factions who could potentially threaten the monarch's control over the city where he resided.

Another factor was religious orthodoxy. Madrid did not have noticeable protestant circles, like the ones rooted out in the autos de fe of 1559 in Seville and Valladolid (circles of Constantino Ponce de la Fuente and Agustín Cazalla, respectively). This meant that the king would be perfectly calm without having to deal with religious disidence in his own city. Alcalá de Henares also had a small but relevant protestant circle linked to the Brocar family.

And speaking of Alcalá de Henares, that town was close to Madrid (5-6 leagues away) and it had a very flourishing university, which meant that the court and its bureaucratic machinery could have a steady supply of jurists, which is something of capital importance for the correct functioning of a state, judges, lawyers, and functionaries sre very necessary. The university of Alcalá was one of the three legally considered Major University, along with Salamanca and Valladolid. 

Finally, the city was ideally suited for growth, with ample space for expansion, and with several good supplies of water, most notably the Manzanares river, but also several streams like Abroñigal. After all, Madrid was and is known for the quality of its water. Let us not forget that its name comes from Magerit, which in Arabic means something along the lines of ""rich in water"".

Then there are little minutiae like the town being close to the mount of El Pardo, which had been known for centuries as a great place for hunting, something that king Philip II enjoyed, just like his very august father.

AskHistorians,Floating feature: Superheroes!,"From [my old answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i3rsom/the_1950s_television_program_the_adventures_of/g0gc044/):

**The 1950's television program ""The Adventures of Superman"" introduces Superman as fighting a ""never ending battle for truth, justice, and the American Way."" What exactly was ""the American way,"" in the minds of the writers of the series and their intended audience?**

After WWII ended, Superman faced off against a new enemy: The Ku Klux Klan.

The group was undergoing a resurgence; the writer Stetson Kennedy had gone undercover with them and another white supremacist group, the Columbians.

He contacted the makers of the Superman radio show. They agreed to a collaboration, out which came the 16-part Clan of the Fiery Cross.

[You can listen to part 1 here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ol8Gmi57DI)

The producer Robert Maxwell received a letter threatening bodily harm if the Klan was not eliminated from future Superman episodes (he ignored it). People started to show up to Klan rallies to make fun of them. The mystique of the organization was broken. One KKK member spoke of the humiliation:

>There was my kid and a bunch of others, some with towels tied around their neck like capes and some with a pillowcase over their heads . . . They said they were playing a new kind of cops and robbers called Superman against the Klan . . . I never felt so ridiculous in all my life!

While this sort of question is often a leaping off point, an idea starter rather than a mutual influence (here's this thing I saw in Game of Thrones, did it happen in real medieval times?), through the 40s and 50s, Superman himself was **incredibly** influential. He became intertwined with the American Way itself. So while I'll be switching for a while to what writers and the public said, I'll also consider Superman himself.

...

As the cultural historian Lawrence Samuel notes, ""There really is no single, identifiable American Way and never has been."" The phrase is an amorphous one that was used often prior to the 20th century, but in ways not really specific to the Superman slogan until the 1920s:

>And what is the ""American Way""? It can be summed up in two words -- voluntary cooperation. This means that a free people has learned how to work together and to work successfully, without surrendering the individual freedom of its members. It means that the government exists for the citizen, not the citizen for the government; that an American is free to choose his own work and is protected in the enjoyment of the fruits of his labor.  
>  
>\-- The American Ways, Bank of the Manhattan Company, 1924

Compare with *What is the ""American Way""?* (Harry Lloyd Hopkins) from 1938:

>The American way is more than a set of constitutional enactments for judicial inerpretation. It is the indwelling spirit of our economic and social order. Like all great things, it may be summed up in a few guiding principles. These are, First, religious liberty; second, freedom of thought and expression; third, the dignity and value of the individual; and fourth, the opportunity of every person to earn an honorable living.

In 1944, a group of Hollywood directors, productors, and others in the motion picture industry formed the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. They soon after wrote

>We believe in, and like, the American Way of Life; the liberty and freedom which generations before us have fought to create and preserve . . . the right to succeed or fail as free men, according to the measure of ability and our strength . . . we find ourself in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism, and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life.

A 1955 pamphlet, My America, is composed of interviews with forty-one Americans. It discusses a ""classless society"", communities working for the common good, and the values of individualism and equality.

There's at least the common thread of emphasis on individual dignity; this is *not* necessarily opposed to strength of community. It's tempting, in modern eyes, to somehow assume a full-on Ayn Rand-libertarian bent, but the American Way was more subtle than that, with language drawn directly from the Constitution. Sometimes it was identified as anti-Communist, sometimes it was something more abstract.

...

At the start of the Eisenhower era -- right when the TV show was starting -- sales of superhero comics started to drop. While the poor remained poor, enough of a middle class started to bloom that comics couldn't rely just on taking on oppressors; Superman gained powers, moving planets, flying through suns, and [tossing a prehistoric ape back through time](https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/titano.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370). Superman was a god.

By that standard, the TV series was positively retro (admittedly, 1950s budgets and technology would have made depicting some of the comic exploits difficult at the time).

TV Superman acted a lot like radio Superman, taking down various crooks and rescuing people in the nick of time. [Here is Lois Lane tied to railroad tracks, with Superman swooping in.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0uNF4y8TZU) Superman always remained noble, always fought to ""preserve freedom"".

In the episode *Panic in the Sky* (widely considered the best of the series), a meteor approaches Metropolis, and Superman must fly up to stop it. He manages to slow it down (it becomes a ""second moon"") but the strange galactic substances within cause him to lose his memory. He still has his powers, but doesn't remember he's Superman. The reporters of the Daily Planet work valiantly to help, but to no avail.

When the meteor threatens once more, only Superman can save the day, but he doesn't remember he's Superman! But he takes a leap based on what his friends are telling him, and only then finds out again he can fly. He uses an explosive to blow up the meteor, and -- again not being sure he's Superman -- blows himself up with it, potentially making an ultimate sacrifice. (Of course, he *is* Superman, so it's all OK in the end.)

Out of all the episodes, I'd argue *Panic in the Sky* most closely encompasses The American Way. Individual heroism, yet needing the support of the community. Willingness to self-sacrifice, either succeeding or failing ""with dignity"", with an unspoken rule that America will be preserved, that things will be OK in the end.

...

Of course, one could easily argue all this was a delusion; Jim Crow was raging, and despite Superman's immigrant origins (and him being created by two first-generation Jewish immigrants, Sieger and Shuster) a strong anti-immigrant bias, even given the American self-image as a ""nation of immigrants"". But The American Way was about the ideal image, not always reality.

Even Superman himself never clinged to the American Way. The original catchphrase just had ""truth and justice""; ""the American Way"" was added in 1942 amidst WWII, then removed again late in the war, then added back in again for the TV show. The 1966 cartoon *The New Adventures of Superman* went with ""truth, justice, and freedom."" Superman himself never even said the whole catchphrase until the 1978 Christopher Reeve movie *Superman*, and it was given new context.

>Lois Lane: Why are you here? There must be a reason you are here.

AskHistorians,When and why did Romans name their children after numbers?,"Remarkably, no, and I'll admit I was very startled when I first found out the real reasons. I had always assumed, like you and your teacher, that number-names were nice and systematic. But then one day I started wondering why there are no Romans named Quartus, and so I started looking for some scholarship on the subject. What I found was this:

They're named after months.

First, notice that this only applies to men's names. Women's names show a fuller set of number-names, including Tertia. It's possible that women could be named for the order of birth; we don't know (as far as I know).

Second, notice that in male *praenomina*, only a few number-names are represented: Quintus, Sextus, and Decimus are the common ones. Septimus exists but is rare and archaic. There are no people with praenomina corresponding to the numbers 1 to 4 until late into the Principate, and mainly in the provinces, especially Celtic areas: that points to a non-Roman origin for those names. The old Roman ones are Quintus, Sextus, and Decimus (and Septimus).

Tertius, which you mention, doesn't appear as a *praenomen* (first name), only as a *cognomen* (official nickname). Octavianus does appear, but it's late and it's clearly modelled on the family name Octavius -- an 'eight' number name following the pattern of Quintus et al. would have been Octavus. So these are exceptions.

The general pattern, it turns out, is: there are masculine praenomina and gentiliican (family) names modelled on the months March, and May to December. The praenomina take a plain *-us* ending, and the gentilician names take an *-ius* ending. Here's the set:

Month|Praenomen|Gentilician name
:--|:--|:--
Martius (March)|Marcus|Marcius
Aprilis (April)|--|--
Maius (May)|Maius|Maius
Iunius (June)|Iunius (very rare)|Iunius
Quintilis (July)|Quintus|Quinctius
Sextilis (August)|Sextus|Sextius
September|Septimus (rare, archaic)|Septimius
October|--|Octavius
November|--|Nonius
December|Decimus|Decius (Roman), Decimius (Samnite)

A few notes:

(1) There's reason to infer a very ancient context for the origins of these names. Note that January and February aren't represented, and that some of the names are rare/archaic. It's been suspected since antiquity that an early form of the Roman calendar had just ten months, running March to December (hence *Decem-ber* = '10th month'), and that January and February were added at some point (very early on). If this is true, it would have to have been in the regal period, centuries before any written records. So the idea of naming people after months -- presumably the month in which they were born -- would have to be at least as early as that. As far as surviving Roman authors are concerned, naming people after months hadn't been a thing for many centuries.

(2) **April:** the etymology of April is unknown. We don't even know whether it comes from Etruscan or somewhere else. As a result it's not all that surprising that there are no names corresponding to it: it may be a relatively late (but still very old) name. It could well be that in the regal period it had another name, and that another well-known praenomen is based on that lost name. That's speculation, but the point is, the situation around April is completely obscure.

(3) **July and August:** as you may already be aware, Quintilis and Sextilis -- the basis for the names Quintus and Sextus -- were renamed in the 1st century BCE to their modern names, July and August. This is many centuries after when the practice of naming people after months would have been in use, so there's no expectation of anyone being named after 'July' and 'August' -- of course, with those, it's the other way round: the months were named after people.

(4) The basic idea that number-names are actually month-names is an ancient one. It was proposed by Varro in the 1st century BCE, and it appears he was dead right. The standard modern treatment is Hans Petersen's 1962 article 'The numeral *praenomina* of the Romans', *Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association* 93: 347-354 [[JSTOR link](http://www.jstor.org/stable/283767)].

(5) As I mentioned above, Octavus doesn't appear (though Octavianus does); neither does Nonus. We don't have good enough data to explain why.

(6) Not all number-names are month-names: as I mentioned above, we do find names like Tertius and Quartus in Celtic contexts, and Tertia in women's names. As well as these, we get various numbers used in *cognomina*; and a couple of gentilician names, Petronius and Pomponius, are derived from Oscan forms of the numbers 'four' (*pettiur, pitora*) and 'five' (*pompe*)."
AskHistorians,"Why is that ""Bharat"", the native endonym for India, is not used much in languages outside of the Indian Subcontinent, even in countries which had long links with India?",[removed]
AskHistorians,Why are the 'Sea Peoples' lumped together in historical references? Who first categorized them thusly and why haven't we stopped?,"One of the u/Bentresh answers you linked itself links to [another answer of theirs](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6mfbrq/tell_me_about_the_philistines_vs_others_in_the/) and I will steal that summary: "" ""Sea Peoples"" is a modern appellation. The Egyptians referred to some, but not all, of the migrating groups of the Late Bronze Age as ""of the sea."" The groups came from different regions of the eastern Mediterranean and, at various times, held different political allegiances."" The main Egyptian references are Ramses III's inscriptions on the temple at Medinet Habu; an Egyptologist could probably give a more recent translation, but Breasted's Ancient Records of Egypt (Volume IV) is online and searchable. The depictions at Medinet Habu feature a number of different headgear and beard styles to mark them as belong to different groups, and there are both naval and land battles depicted and described (the relation of the different battles is unclear). There are also a handful of maritime references in letters from Hittite-dominated areas that do indicate seaborne movement as a common element to a number of these migrations (e.g the Šikalāyū... who live on ships"" (RS 34.129, text 12 in RSO 7; likely the same group as the Egyptian Shekelesh)) but don't use the term 'sea peoples; no group called themselves that. 

So, the term originates in an ancient Egyptian description. It was paraphrased and applied by 19th century scholars to other groups the ancient authors associated with those seaborne migrants at the same time, and thus became a catchall for the number of groups who appear in the ancient sources as a new, migrating problem.

Why has it stuck? It's close enough to an ancient description that, barring a better term, worked well enough to make clear who was under discussion--distinguishing the Sherden 'of the sea', and also the Peleset who fought alongside, them when they share much of the same narrative doesn't accomplish much. I think that this is the issue in Cline's AMA, he tends to be taking the POV of eastern Mediterranean kings/kingdoms, so focuses more on the impact of the new people than who they are (I don't remember my impression of Cline's book being as harsh as u/UndercoverClassicist, but it's been a while since I read it and UndercoverClassicist certainly has a command of recent archaeology, and their overall take on the 'collapse' thesis--and who the narrative is for--is convincing).

What became of these peoples? A question as hard to answer as who they were in the late 13th century. They did not create polities using the names they Egyptians give us, and some become very difficult to track. Since--as Bentresh says--the kingdoms encountering these groups mainly saw them as foreign and generally threatening, our sources do not focus on their state formation/integration--to say nothing of the administrative disruption most big kingdoms saw. That said, the ancient writers did know there were differences between groups and locate specific peoples in specific places (Bentresh mentions Tjekker at Dor and Philistines at Gath as examples). Much ink has been spilled attempting to tie a group name in one century with a group name a few centuries earlier, and to link both with the archaeological evidence. I think the Tell Tayinat=Walasatin=Palestine=Late Helladic IIIC=Peleset identifications have the preponderance of evidence in their favor, to use an example: Tell Tayinat is a site in southeastern Turkey about 15 miles from Antakya (ancient Antioch) and 40 miles from Aleppo (ancient Halab). It has been identified by the University of Toronto team excavating it as Kunulua, capital of a 'Neo-Hittite' kingdom (not a great term, but still the dominant one)--the kingdom of Wadasatini, and later called Patina. Various inscriptions and Luwian linguistics (not my field) has indicated that Patina was a contracted form of Palastina (also spelled Walastina and Wadasatini in other inscriptions at Tayinat; this being the same is the Luwian argument I can't evaluate). Somewhat recently, they have also found pottery in the Late Helladic IIIC style (also called Mycenaean IIIC), a style which originated in the Late Bronze Age Aegean, but which is later associated with the Philistines in their major cities in what is now Gaza and southwestern Israel. The way they put this together: in the Late Bronze Age as the Hittite sphere of influence was shrinking, people who made pots in the way both Mycenean/Aegean peoples and Philistines do moved to the abandoned Tell Tayinat, and founded a kingdom known as Palastin. Additionally, the eminent David Hawkins does believe there is an etymological connection between Palastin(a) and Peleset, with the connection of Pelest to Philistine seeming more settled. Hard not to see 'Sea People' moving into a power vacuum!

(Yes, pots aren't people, but they see indications that the LHIIIC ware is local-made, not imported, when other locales stick to LBA Syro-Anatolian styles well into the 1100s BCE, and there is a long period of abandonment before the LBA settlement; Aegean-style loomweights are another indicator of change in local populace. There are many more tidbits of evidence those in favor of the identifications marshal, but they each require their own explanation and context, and it's arguing turtles all the way down). As with essentially all ancient studies, it is hard to prove anything beyond doubt, but there are too many factors to be dismissed as simply coincidence.

The DNA evidence is well beyond my expertise, though migrating groups merging with the populace of their new home is a common outcome, so that would make sense.  

In sum:   


* Are the 'sea peoples' lumped together in ancient sources? Kind of but not really, the words 'of the sea' are used by Ramses III to describe some of his enemies, and they and others are mentioned occasionally acting together, but are indeed considered distinct.


* Who used the term' sea peoples' first? 19th century French orientalists, and it became the term for all Ramses III's Year 8 enemies, and it remained the standard term until the 1980s/90s and has mostly been used in scare quotes since.


* Where is the list of group names? Ramses III's Medinet Habu is the biggest source, but other mentions can be found in Egyptian sources (Ramses II and Merenptah) and mentions of similar names can be found in Hittite- and Akkadian-language documents, though usually with even less context.


* Did the Sea Peoples disperse into the population of the Levant? Likely; the particular groups named by the Egyptians don't remain a political entity with that exact name, but some names seem to have linguistic connections to later ones in the Levant, and some of those can be tied to changes in trade and settlement patterns in the LBA.


* Why haven't we stopped? My opinion is that it is too convenient and no good alternative has presented itself. In the LBA, lots of new groups show up, interact with states that are contracting or collapsing, and then we don't hear about them again. It's hard to provide enough of a different or distinct narrative to grant these peoples a clearer designation, and without much reason to separate the group or reframe it we are stuck with the inertia of the old name. And at this point, academics know most of the caveats of the term; that battle at least I think has been won. I personally think that it's taken on enough of its own life in the history-adjacent space (memes, youtube, etc) that even if the academic community comes up with a more accurate term, 'Sea Peoples' (still far better than a completely ahistorical monolithic 'Sea People') will live on for decades as an easy way to invoke the mystique of ancient collapse."
AskHistorians,Why were the Japanese so willing to adopt Western music/fashion/culture during the Meiji period?,"This isn't intended to challenge the other answer here, but supplement it. I actually have answered this in the past, which you can find [here; re: ""Why did Emperor Meiji westernise the nation during the industrialisation period? Why wasn't he interested in modernizing the nation without westernisation?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qwm1nt/meiji_restoration/hl68lu3/) Point two touches on how many reformers didn't see cultural values being adopted in necessarily relative terms. In the eyes of many Meiji reformers, Japan was embracing universal principles, not abandoning Japanese-ness. Sometimes it even suggested that the reforms being made were a return to tradition (seen in point one).

The short version is that it wasn't even necessarily construed as ""Westernizing"" in the first place and there was a lot of disagreement about how to go about it.

AskHistorians,Why do grand historic homes have so little closet space?,"My wife and I are extensive world travelers with her having a degree in industrial design. We have visited castles, fortress, mansions as old as 1200 AD through present architecture. My grandmother was an interior decorator, working from the 40s through 80s. I have limited primary literature sources, but a range of personal and familial knowledge from both travels throughout Europe, North America, India  and China. I report from accumulated knowledge from travels and family professional experience, as well as some limited literature sources.  
  
Chests (of drawers or otherwise), armoires, cabinets (the movable types), dressers, trunks, etc cetera. All of these were used for storage of clothing and other goods before closets and other side rooms became more common. You see depictions of storage of clothing some in Racinet's Costume History, and other literature on the development/evolution of clothing. You answer your own question in a way, mentioning these various cabinetries. The follow-up question: Why don't you see them? Is worth some further explanation.  
  
The growth of wealth in various classes dictated the use of space alongside the evolution of the concept of privacy. I would refer you to one of the many excellent threads on privacy in this sub. In North America, China, India, and Europe where I have traveled and in the professional educations of my wife and grandmother, the answers have been largely the same with differences only in timing of the distribution of wealth and concepts of privacy. 
  
Expensive armoires and other cabinetry was a show of wealth as much, if not moreso, than the clothing itself. You can see some of these decorative works of cabinetry in museums across the globe, some do still remain in situ.  These trunks, cabinets, dressers, and the like were used heavily, would travel with their owners, and be passed on to following generations. Thus, few examples remain in place due to damage or distribution. With socioeconomic changes (alongside privacy changes), such cabinetry fell out of vogue, and you begin to see the development of closets. These spaces were initially changing areas but evolved to become clothing storage areas, with some regression/reemergence even to date. Walk in closets were becoming popular again at the end of my late grandmother's career.
  
TL:DR: Cabinetry is/was expensive, so traveled with the hosts and were passed down through generations. Years/generations of use lent them to damage. Also concepts of privacy evolved favoring closets and separate spaces.

AskHistorians,Was the Zambian space program an elaborate joke on colonial attitudes?,"I don't think it was intended as a ""joke"" targeted at the West, at least.

I do need to hedge my language here a bit, as the debate on just how serious Edward Makuka Nkoloso was being was a debate even the time, but I can point to a specific reason why I think he was genuinely sincere.

I would first like to set aside the notion that he was mentally unsound. In his years before Zambia's independence -- when he was a freedom fighter and the area he was in was still called Northern Rhodesia -- he did spend a year under arrest from the Northern Rhodesia police and put to torture. At least one journalist (Andrew Sardanis) put the dots together that he had ""lost it"" due to this.

While possible, the idea that any ""eccentric"" behavior is only the result of mental illness is a popular one, but one I'd be very cautious of without further evidence. The only evidence is really the space program itself.

The first that the world was exposed to the plan was an article in _Time_ magazine [from October 30, 1964](https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,876312-2,00.html), in an article about the the newly-independent Zambia and the president, Kenneth David Kaunda. It was simply a paragraph aside:

>During the independence festivities only one noted Zambian failed to share in all the harmony. He is Edward Mukuka Nkoloso, a grade-school science teacher and the director of Zambia's National Academy of Science, Space Research and Philosophy, who claimed the goings-on interfered with his space program to beat the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the moon. Already Nkoloso is training twelve Zambian astronauts, including a curvaceous 16-year-old girl, by spinning them around a tree in an oil drum and teaching them to walk on their hands, ""the only way humans can walk on the moon.""

This led to enough interest to get other news outlets to come, eventually leading to a [recorded story from November 1964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZBY-Hb-TDw). The video includes some of the ""afronauts"" in training, like rolling down a hill in a oil drum, or having the aspiring space explorer swing high on a rope swing and having the rope cut at the highest point, giving a brief feeling of weightlessness.

There's certainly a faint air of mocking in the interview, with a zoom-in on the ""rocket"" Nkoloso mentions, and interviewer finishing with ""to most Zambians, these people are just a bunch of crackpots, and from what I have seen today, I am inclined to agree.""

A [opinion story penned by Nkoloso](http://blogs.bootsnall.com/theglobaltrip/updates/DSC00988marsprogramV.JPG) himself explains

>I see the Zambia of the future as a space-age Zambia, more advanced than Russia or America. In fact, in my Academy of Sciences our thinking is already six or seven years ahead of both powers.

>It is unlucky for Lusaka that I did not have the chance to run for mayor. If I had been elected, the capital city of Zambia would quickly have been another Paris, if not another New York ... But never mind, we will have our Paris yet.

Note how this isn't just obsessive about space, but about Zambian achievement.

>Stadium and Zambia would have conquered Mars only a few days after independence. Yes, that's where we plan to go -- Mars.

>We have been studying the planet through telescopes at our headquarters and are now certain Mars is populated by primitive natives ... Specially trained space-girl Matha Mwambwa, two cats (also specially trained) and a missionary will be launched in our first rocket. But I have warned the missionary he must not force Christianity on the people in Mars if they do not want it.

This article was written at Zambia's independence -- grousing, essentially, that it was not possible to launch a rocket as commemoration -- but it was written in a local newspaper _before_ world media knew about it. The _Time_ paragraph and other media came later.

There's also been some claims the whole center was a ""cover"" for freedom fighter operations. (The afronaut center started several years before independence.) Nkoloso certainly had the credentials; what got him arrested in the first place was a ""disturbance"" in 1957 where he arranged a civil disobedience campaign (where Africans would refuse orders to work). When the summons for his arrest came he went on the run for six days; when he tried to surrender, a riot ensued.

However, the rumors were fairly unconnected and disparate (like connecting them to a bombing, because scientists = knowledge of bomb?). General opinion was that this was simply a lark, just not one specifically oriented at the West. President Kaunda (the subject of the _Time_ article) [was interviewed much later](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-zambian-afronaut-who-wanted-to-join-the-space-race):

>It wasn’t a real thing, he wasn’t a scientist, as such. But he used to do some—I can’t say ""funny things,"" but many people enjoyed themselves in what he was talking about ... It was more for fun than anything else.

In one of his last interviews (1989) Nkoloso still claimed to hold on to the dream:

>I have not abandoned the project. I still have the vision of the future of man. I still feel man will freely move from one planet to another.

AskHistorians,How did the tawdry and explicit works of V.C. Andrews (In particular the Flowers in the Attic series) come to be primarily marketed to and read by middle school girls in the 1980s and 1990s?,">I had a bout of growing bone which threw my body out of alignment,
but the doctors would not believe me when I said my hip hurt. They 
said, 'You walk too gracefully, you can't possibly hurt, you look 
too good.' I found out that looking too good is a terrible way to 
go into a doctor's office: They don't take you seriously. They 
think women are vain anyway.

The above quote is from V.C. Andrews herself, whose medical
conditions as a teen made her wheelchair-bound. After graduating
from art school she originally supported herself as a portrait
painter, but gradually got the impulse to write, and began
producing page after page of typewritten manuscripts.

V.C. Andrews first attempt at sending out a manuscript
was an autobiographical novel, _One Under a Parasol_;
it got rejected so many times she destroyed it. She
admits while it had ""a strong theme"" she ""wasn't a 
good writer yet"" at the time. She followed with 
_The Obssessed_, which had an agent interested, but the
agent informed her that 290,000 words (something like
700 pages, although this can vary wildly based on
printing) was too long. Andrews took this to heart and
followed with the 98-page _Flowers in the Attic_.

(This is importantly contextually for the main question;
while books popular amongst young adults can be long,
they tend to the shorter side. But notice she's just
producing ""another novel"", not something for a particular
market.)

The novel wasn't perfect as of yet, and the early readers
suggested leaning in to the extreme aspects, encouraging
her to (in her own words) ""deal with all those unspeakable
things my mother didn't want me to write about, which
was exactly what they wanted to do in the first place.""

Specifically, it tells the story of Dollangangers, and the
mother and grandmother who lock four children in the attic
as an inheritance conspiracy; horror, abuse, and (mostly infamously) an 
incest-rape scene eventually follow.

The rewritten version of the book was picked up by Pocket
Books in 1978. Due to the subject matter (and somewhat less-than-literary style)
Pocket Books decided to do the ""reviewer bypass"" upon publishing the book
and go straight to mass-market paperback.  To clarify: hard covers by new authors tended to need positive reviews to get attention. This was was also right 
when soft covers were starting to become huge in general,
so by publishing in soft cover it was an appeal directly
to the general public for popularity.

(As predicted, reviews that eventually came out were
savage, the Washington Post calling it ""deranged swill"".)

The typical author interviews and touring were a no-go, due to Andrews having
reduced mobility. The publisher used preview editions instead,
giving out 25,000 free books and 250,000 free chapters. The
word of mouth was explosive and the book became a giant 
best-selling hit (14 months on the NYT list). 

>I cried the whole way through, it was like my childhood when my stepfather punished me brutally and locked me in the attic. It was like you'd gotten ahold of my thought waves.

>-- [Letter from a 57-year old man, writing to V. C. Andrews](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/09/20/blooms-of-darkness/7e133556-82cd-43a0-94a6-03738d628099/)

As far as why it resonated so strongly (but not only!) amongst younger women, teens, and pre-teens: the cultural phenomenon was that of
a forbidden volume being passed from person to person; adults
would have ""the talk"" with kids who were found reading Andrews.
While Andrews dedicated to the book to her mother, her mother refused
to read it when she found out about the incest.

Paul Sciarrotta in an interview with _Salon_, talking about reading the
novel in middle school: ""It had been passed around through a bunch of people at school and people were whispering about it.""

Other transgressive novels popular amongst the same age group at 
the time include Stephen King (_It_, you may or may not remember, 
had a child orgy) and Piers Anthony (who filled his Xanth novels
with both text and subtext). Part of the pleasure of the read of such books
was getting away with something illicit. [Gillian Flynn, who would
go on to write _Gone Girl_](https://www.npr.org/2012/07/23/156261690/in-the-attic-whips-witches-and-a-peculiar-princess#:~:text=More%20Podcasts%20%26%20Shows-,'In%20The%20Attic'%3A%20Whips%2C%20Witches%20And%20A%20Peculiar%20Princess,kept%20her%20turning%20the%20pages.):

>It was not the kind of thing my earnest, thoughtful parents would have bought me: ""Here, Gilly, is a novel about four children who are locked away in an attic by their beautiful mother. There's sex, lust, murder, ballet, betrayal, potato salad, whippings and — oh yes, the eldest brother and sister are incestuous. Discussion questions to come!""

Also popular from this demographic: the idea that the adults are not to be trusted, and the children must rely on each other.

Still, the V. C. Andrews phenomenon (in terms of popularity) went over and above many similar attempts. The thing that seemed to 
clinch the sell: it was _not_ (and still is not) marketed to young adults. (In fact, the publisher originally thought it
might sell more to men, and they consequently had Virginia go the ""just use initial letters"" route to keep her gender out 
of her author name.) Yes, bookstores might have sorted
the book the way, but it is still officially listed in Simon and Schuster's catalog as ""fiction"". The current
40th Anniversary cover calls it ""A CLASSIC BESTSELLING NOVEL OF FORBIDDEN LOVE"". While
it has the breezy pace, easy language, and main character age range of young adult fiction, it was unapologetically
and obviously taboo in a way, that, say, the first Xanth novels weren't.

Also, while _Flowers in the Attic_ was _not_ autobiographical (that was the
earlier, destroyed novel) it has been speculated that Andrews had some
experience with the feeling of confinement which gave her vivid plot setup more resonance. Her novel become her
literal breakout. Her becoming rich from
royalties (not the initial check, nobody knew it was going to be a megahit)
led her to getting a computer with a word processor, expensive furniture, and a van large enough to fit her wheelchair. She eventually got to travel, visiting her fans in the UK. [According
to Jonathan Lloyd](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/the-ghost-of-vc-andrews-the-life-death-and-afterlife-of-the), who worked for her British publisher:

>She came with her mother. We had a big party and dinner, I think at Claridge's Hotel in London ... She wasn't really used to parties. I remember she had rather a lot of drinks. My boss at the time used to smoke cigars, and we gave her a cigar. She got very wild. Her mother, in the end, said, 'I'm taking her away, I'm taking her upstairs.'

AskHistorians,Where did the idea of Lycanthropy/Skinwalkers originate?,"The belief that “all legends are founded upon something” is, itself, an aspect of modern folklore, frequently exhibited by questions on this subreddit. 

The idea that all things that are conveniently lumped together under the English-language term “dragon” are related is also a fallacy. They may seem more or less, vaguely similar, but they are surprisingly different, and it is just a linguistic convenience to translate indigenous terms with the word “dragon” – that does not mean they are similar or related.

Some people have speculated that there are inherent fears built into the shared human experience – including a fear of snakes – which has caused dragons to emerge as a worldwide motif, manifesting as a beast to be feared. That is pure speculation, completely unfounded on anything, and its flaw is demonstrated by the fact that many cultures have a beloved “dragon” tradition (so-called, again, by the convenience of a translated word). Some “dragons” are, in fact, kindly, lucky fixtures in folklore, bearing very little resemblance to the classic, feared, European dragon.

Many cultures – but not all – have a traditional belief that people can transform into animals. This often has a counterpart, which allows animals to transform into people. This is not universal, nor are the traditions that allow for these transformations in any way related. Some cultures (famously, western Europe, for example) allow for this. 

Folklorists have noted that when a folktale featuring this sort of transformation diffuses into a region that does not have this belief, the motif needs to be adjusted. For example, the hero earns the ability to transform into various animals because he befriends each of these animals; when manifesting in non-transformation cultures, the hero acquires a hair, feather, etc., which he can rub to summon the animal who acts as his assistant.

How do we explain why some cultures have a belief in the ability of people to transform into animals? A belief in this sort of thing is grounded upon a deeply held cultural assumption that is extremely difficult to explain. We can describe it, and we can understand how the belief manifests in folklore and various cultural practices, but explaining it is another matter. Some may put forward an explanation – suggesting some deep-seated reason why this point of view exists in some (but not all) cultures, but those suggestions are speculative. They can’t be proven, and they can only sit on the shelf in a rather hollow way."

AskHistorians,Why did Napoleon get into so many wars?,"Despite his reputation as a warmonger, largely originating from the *dark legend* created by the French monarchy after its Restauration, and some British historians, Napoléon's **early** campaigns were all defensive in nature. It changed later.

When Napoléon took power through the Brumaire *coup* in 1799, he found the country already at war, so that cant' be held against him. Napoléon at Marengo and Moreau at Hohenlinden defeated Austria (1800), forcing it to sue for peace.

France then (1801) was only at war with Britain. Neither opponent could reach the other (the French Navy was powerless against the Royal Navy, and Britain had no continental allies left to support an expeditionnary corps on land), so Napoléon reach to the British governement and offered a ""Peace of the Braves"", which was accepted in the form of the Treaty of Amiens (1802).

This brought one year of peace (March 1802-May 1803), the longest such period in Europe under Napoléon's reign. It is hard to imagine today, but Napoléon was initially held as the Peacemaker of Europe: his ambassador in Britain to negociate the Treaty of Amiens, general **Law de Lauriston**, was even greeted in London by a joyful crowd which cut his carriage's horses free and dragged him themselves around the city:

https://preview.redd.it/l6y39qoe4vfa1.jpeg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e95747806a3ee9c9cea07f06fd948ecc0707a9b7

The Peace of Amiens would only last for about a year, falling appart in May 1803. The reasons are many, shared between both sides, but it is to be remembered that Britain broke it by addressing an ultimatum to France, then perpetrated the first act of war (seizing of all French & Dutch merchant ships in British harbours) even without declaring itself. Not the opposite.

Napoléon then rose an army and reinforced his navy for a landing in Britain. While the British initialy made fun of the Frogs' efforts, they soon realize that they couldn't hamper them and started getting nervous. Everything had to be done to turn away Napoléon from his goal.

The solution was a new coalition, initiated and paid by Britain to attack France. Russia & Austria both joined. Threatened in the East, and left without a Navy (and thus a way of securing the Channel for his crossing) after the disastrous defeat at Trafalgar, Napoléon turned his might East. Faced with superior forces, on paper, Napoléon didn't give his opponent time to regroup and attacked first, bringing war on enemy territory to spare France any destruction (and loss of popular support for himself).

He first defeated the Coalition in 1805 at Austerlitz, then while the *Grande Armée* was on its way back to France, Prussia declared war on its own (with British support though) and was defeated at Iena-Auerstaedt in 1806. Then in 1807, the Russians, defeated at Austerlitz but still at war (unlike Austria) returned with a new army to support Prussia. By the time they arrived, the latter's army was down to a small corps, and Napoléon defeated them at Friedland (short version ;).

So, from 1800 to 1807, Napoléon as a head of State made peace, and waged defensive war (yet in enemy territory).

\----------

After the treaty of Tilsit with the Czar of Russia, with whom he basically divided Europe between them two, Napoléon got a big head and saw himself as invincible, a new Ceasar, and thought of placing his family on Europe's thrones.

He then declare, all by himself, war on his former (although dubious) ally Spain to remove their royal family and replace them with his brother Joseph. This (mostly) uncalled aggression is one of Napoléon true warmongering, and basically the start of his might's decline. Spain, from 1808 to 1814, would become Napoléonic France's Vietnam War, the military cancer which would tie up and waste ten of thousands of troops. Britain, of course, offered its help to Portugal & Spain, this time not only financial, but by sending an expeditionary under **sir John Moore**, later **Arthur Wellesley** (futur **duke of Wellington**).

When his troops in Spain, away from his supervision, started suffering setbacks, Napoléon had to go there in person (late 1808) to restore the situation and his army's reputation. But the damage was done, and Austria declared war on France in 1809 (still with British backing) while Napoléon was in Spain. He returned and defeated tem, hence another defensive war.

Then came the war of 1812 between France & Russia. As always, there isn't a single culprit, relations deteriorate for about two years before Napoléon this time, declared war on Russia (which immediatly got Britain's support ;). We all know how it ended, with the disastrous retreat and destruction of the *Grande Armée*.

1813-1814 was the continuation of that war, with another coalition building up around Russia & Britain. Napoléon was on the defensive again, but he can be blamed for still believing he could turn fate on the battlefields, and thus refusing to seek for a diplomatic arrangement.

In 1815, Napoléon broke international law by returning to France and taking power again during the *Hundred Days*, although he knew the Allies were plotting on their own for deporting him to far-away St-Helena. He tried to assure Europe's governements that he was done with war, but the laters' representatives being gathered at the Vienna Conference all agreed to get rid of him once and for all.

\----------------------

To conclude, Napoléon brought peace in Europe in 1801, and fought defensive wars in 1805-1807 and 1809. The one war he really initiated was the Peninsular War (1808-1814), which happened to be the first nail on his Empire's coffin.

And although the French-Russian war of 1812 had shared origins, its continuation in 1813-1814 can mostly be blamed on his stubborness to seek resolution on the fields of battle.

1815 is a special case, with Napoléon breaking the previous treaties ... preventively before the Allies did. And being declared war by them. I would call it a draw ... :)

Most of Napoléon's conquests were the results of defensive campaigns (1805-1807 & 1809), not wars of aggression, both of which (Spain & Russia) actually brought his ruin.

As for the reasons why so many countries declared war on him, they are, as often, many:

* desire of revenge from previous defeats & humilitation/occupation
* rise of nationalism and anti-French sentiment in occupied territories (especially Germany & Spain)
* desire to recover lost territories from previous defeats (especially Austria).
* economic war, due to the Continental Blockade and Imperial system imposed by France, which ruined their economy
* Britain's lobbying and offer to pay any war expense if they attacked France
* Old monarchy couldn't accept that an upstart could crown himself Emperor, if only for their own safety: they didn't want such a thing to happen home. On that matter, the only country which would have accepted France's new regime would have been ... Britain, which didn't care a bit about that issue!
* As for Britain, it was France's dominance over the Low Countries which was unacceptable to London, for it held a permanent threat of raid on mainland Britain.  Antwerp especially was regarded as a ""*pistol aimed at Britain's heart*""."
AskHistorians,"Is there any truth to the idea that in ancient China, a bride could be the wrong person because they weren't seen until after the marriage?","I'm writing this from my cellphone so apologies for awkward formatting and spelling issues. 

I'm guessing OP's question has to do with the popular depiction of 掀蓋頭 （lifting the red veil) we commonly see in many modern films and TV dramas showing the ""traditional Chinese wedding"" scene, most notable in the classic film 紅高粱 （“Red Sorghum"") directed by Zhang Yimou, a loose adaptation of Nobel literature prize recipient Mo Yan's novel. The troupe typically portrays a vaguely timeless rurual China setting, some elaborate ""traditional"" wedding celebration taking place amidst a cacophony of folk music instruments and colorful processions of esoteric folk rituals, invariably the camera focuses on the bride, dressed in fine red wedding garment with her face completely covered with a vermillion silk wedding veil popularly know as ""紅蓋頭.”  The veiled bride would sit idly in an elaborately decorated sedan carried by a dozen or so sweaty, half-naked, well built young men, marching in perfectly chronographed steps... .... For those uninitiated, here's the YouTube link to the full movie: https://youtu.be/talIYdQzbHg a highly recommended classic of contemporary Chinese magical realist literature, but not an accurate representation of historical Chinese wedding practices. 

Just like QiPao (China dress), the practice of 掀蓋頭 （lifting the red veil) is in fact a modern reinvention which combines imported Western  sensibilities (in this case the bridal veil) with ""traditional"" Chinese cultural elements. The ""red bridal veil"" as we know today most likely emerged sometime around late Qing or early Republic era, basically the turn of 20th century. It fell into relative obscurity from 1940s to 1970s, and regained popularity starting 1980s in part due to popular media depictons and the end of the Cultural Revolution. 

The historical Chinese wedding ceremony encompasses a diverse umbrella of cultural practices from  different local traditions, while simoutanously been govered by the rule framework of Imperial ritual law: an amalgamation of traditional Confucian canon law and imperial codes. With regard to Confucian canon law on marriage, the key constitutional text could be found in the Book of Poetry -> Lessons from the states -> Odes Of Zhou And The South - Guan Ju: the courtship is formally initiated by a personal exchange of gift between the gentlemen and the lady, of which the lady's acceptance of the gift would signal the beginning of formal courtship. If the courtship goes well, the gentlent would offer the next set of personal gift to his lady, and if the lady retuns him a personal gift of her's, then the courtship would culminate to the wedding accompanied with music and festivities. In practice, according to the Tang code, marriage involves a multi-progned consultative process which begins with the parents of the to-be-married commissioning a government approved agent known as Meiren to reach out to appropriate and proper households with eligible bachelors.  The Meiren would act as liaison between two files to communicate their terms of marriage, then arrange parents of both household to meet their counterpart bachelors, then arrange the two bachelors to meet themselves. After consent is reched for families and children of both sides, wedding may proceed and will be recorded in the local magistrate's office. There's a famous story arc in Liao Zhai Zhu Yi where the local gentry's daughter purposely stalling the arranged marriage process by refusing to meet her suiters in person (she is already familiar with all of her suiters as they have been childhood friends for years, but it is the formal meeting that counts). Anyhow, marriage ritual is a historically thick subject of which I could elaborate much more, but for the purpose of OP's question, the answer is quite simple: the aforementioned scenario is highly improbable, and the red silk veil would not lead to a ""surprise bride""."

AskHistorians,Floating Feature: So You Say You Want A Revolution,"My original intent with my Ph.D. program (more than three decades ago!) was to write a portrait of Irish fenians in the mining West (and in particular on the Comstock Mining District), with the tentative title, ""Revolution in Exile."" As I started working on the project, I realized that I needed a good cultural history of the mining district. The previous professional history of the place (focusing on the mines) was published in 1883, under Congressional mandate. Congress had funded a second, cultural history, but then withdrew funding as the mines began to fail after two decades of bonanza.

Needing that history, I turned my focus to that, resulting in [The Roar and the Silence: A History of Virginia City and the Comstock Lode](https://www.amazon.com/Roar-Silence-Virginia-Shepperson-Humanities-ebook/dp/B008BUSNQ4?ref_=ast_author_dp) (1998). Sadly, I never finished my history of the fenians!

That history, however, is fascinating in its own right. The international fenian movement established itself just as the Comstock was realizing its full potential, following the first strikes in 1859. The fenians organized some of the first military organizations in the territory, acquiring weapons and uniforms and forming what would become the backbone of the Nevada National Guard. They first formally took part in a parade in 1864 for the 4th of July.

During intense fenian activity (invading Canada in 1866 and 1870-1871), Comstock fenians raised considerable money, which was then sent to the New York office. We now know that the New York fenians were largely skimming proceeds for their own purposes and little ended up advancing the cause of Irish nationalism, but the amount of money raised on the Comstock - thousands of dollars (when a good wage was $4 a day) was significant.

Ultimately, the Irish represented a third of Virginia City - the largest community of the Comstock. They formed a strong union (the first miners union west of the Mississippi), and they became a formidable presence politically.

Comstock mines occasionally slumped, but for two decades, they always sprung back to life, culminating in the famed ""Big Bonanza,"" a history-making deposit of gold and silver discovered in 1873. The ""Irish Four"" - investors and miners - joined the ranks of the wealthiest people in the world thanks to that discovery.

That said, a slump in 1869 put stress on the local economy and when that sort of thing happened, there was sometimes ethnic stress. That year, the Cornish miners organized their own militia. While the Irish had named their groups after Old World heroes - the Robert Emmet Guard being the largest - the miners from Cornwall named theirs the Washington Guard, a clear declaration that unlike the Irish who looked across the Atlantic as a focus of their loyalty, the Cornish were ""true Americans,"" who consequently deserved preferential treatment as jobs became scarce. 

Much of this was underscored by religious difference. Although the Irish were powerful demographically, their Catholic faith was held as suspect among many of the others living in the region. The Cornish could boast of being ""good American"" protestants, being largely Methodists.

I describe these differences and how the ideal of revolution manifested differently among these competing immigrant groups in my article, [""Defining the Group: Nineteenth-Century Cornish on the North American Frontier""](https://www.academia.edu/39021186/Defining_the_Group_Nineteenth_Century_Cornish_on_the_North_American_Frontier) (1994)"
AskHistorians,Thomas Jefferson was rumored to enjoy macaroni and cheese. What were the main types of cheese available to colonists during the Revolutionary War period?,"First things first, Thomas Jefferson isn't just rumored to have liked it... he *did* like it. As a matter of fact, macaroni and cheese was largely popularized in America by French Master Chef James Hemings' recipe, which he devised while learning French ""cookery"" with master chefs in France, and his was something one congressman called ""pie of macaroni"" after enjoying the dish in 1802 at the White House. The congressman, in truth, did not enjoy the dish but it continued to spread in popularity nonetheless. And in an odd coincidence, while that congressman dined inside with the President, a gigantic cheese wheel lay in the White House known simply as the Mammoth Cheese. It was gifted to President Jefferson from a town in Massachusetts through the Baptist congregation of Rev John Leland. How mammoth was it? At over 1,200lbs its rumored to have taken every cow in the area to provide the milk - being some 900 cows. So much milk was donated that three cheeses were made, the largest being selected to gift our chief executive. It was so big it lasted at least three years (delivered on New Year's Day 1802) and the nasty remnants were allegedly thrown into the Potomac River sometime in 1805, two years after maggots began to nibble on the block. They made it in a six foot cider press and even had the logo *Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God* stamped into the surface, a motto which Ben Franklin proposed for the Great Seal of the United States but, failing to secure it for that purpose, it later was appropriated as a personal logo of Jefferson. Jefferson wrote of the cheese;

>the Mammoth cheese is arrived here and is to be presented this day. it is 4 f 4½ I. diameter, 15. I. thick, and weighed in August 1230. ‚Ñî. They were offered 1000. D. in New York for the use of it 12. days as a shew. 

Not wanting to appear improper in regards to reception of gifts as President, Jefferson paid Leland, who he had met when the Reverend resided in Virginia, 200$ for the cheese. Anyhow, Hemings' recipe was not the first in America as a cookbook available in many colonies was published in 1769 with a similar recipe (posted in the link below). The dish from which both recipes are derived is much, much older, and you can read about how it became modernized (up through colonial times) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ysk341/what_exactly_was_the_italian_macaronibased_dish/), which includes some old recipes and even the mac and cheese recipe I use (trust me, it's amazing).

So what cheese did Jefferson have available? A lot of imported permesan as well as cheddar, a real American cheese though it did not originate here. For many colonial or early republic Americans importing parmesan wasn't really an option, so they bought local or, more commonly, made their own. How did that start? The epicenter of early cheese production was Rhode Island, Connecticut, and, as you may have guessed from the folks in Chesire making a block so large it needed a sleigh to transport it, Massachusetts. The practice crept west, and soon New York and Vermont became big time cheese producers. Once Ohio was opened to settlement they became the epicenter of cheese production and remained so until the mid 1800s (when Wisconsin took over and still is our cheese capital to this day). We know there was cheese in the Mayflower when the Pilgrims landed and pretty much since that time cheese production has happened in the colonies/states. 

Cows give a lot of milk and you can't just turn them off or not milk them until you need to - your cows required milking daily from spring through fall (they did not produce during winter months in colonial America). What could you do with all this milk besides drink/cook it or give it away? There were two options to stabilize it and greatly increase its shelf life; make cheese and/or make butter. The Pilgrims brought both on *Mayflower* and soonafter the early Puritan settlers came with both the knowledge of cheese production and plenty of cows needed to supply the commodity. How? The (raw) milk is heated, something like rennet (an animal byproduct, vinegar or leman/citrus could also be used) is added, and the mixture is then left to seperate. Once the curd separates the mix was poured over cheesecloth to allow the liquids/whey to run through (which was usually collected and used for other dishes). Bam, just that easily you've essentially got cottage cheese. Want a more refined product? Well, you gotta get more of the remaining whey out, so the cloth would be wrapped around the curds and then squeezed, slowly forcing the whey out. Or hung by a string and left to drip out. By whatever process the whey would be extracted, drying and increasing the flavor of the cheese. To really make a refined cheese this would be placed into a press (either a screw press or a weight press) and held under pressure for a while, forcing most of the remaining whey and moisture out of the curd and pressing it into a firm block. Put that on a shelf for a while to allow those enzymes to do their thing, flipping and salting rather often, and now you have a genuine ""farmers cheese."" Not content with such a simple product, many New England farmers further refined their cheese by ""melting"" the curds together and removing even more whey in a process they brought from England to make cheddar which was quite stable, meaning it could be carried to market and sold rather easily. These were the two most common refined cheeses in America pre-1800 by far and most colonists, particularly those proximal to cows, goats, or sheep, would have been exposed to at least farmers cheese from one of these animals' milk.

Curds, the primary building block that makes cheese, were also used in a variety of recipes and were likely the most common type of ""cheese"" consumed in British North American colonies and, later, American States. We see in Mary Randolph's 1824 cookbook recipes for Curds and Cream, as well as a Curd Pudding. She also lays out a recipe for rennet;

>TO PREPARE RENNET.

>Take the stomach from the calf as soon as it is killed--do not wash it, but hang it in a dry cool place for four or five days; then turn it inside out, slip off all the curd nicely with the hand, fill it with a little saltpetre mixed with the quantity of salt necessary, and lay it in a small stone pot, pour over it a small tea-spoonful of vinegar, and sprinkle a handful of salt over it, cover it closely and keep it for use. You must not wash it--that would weaken the gastric juice, and injure the rennet. After it has been salted six or eight weeks, cut off a piece four or five inches long, put it in a large mustard bottle, or any vessel that will hold about a pint and a half; put on it five gills of cold water, and two gills of rose brandy--stop it very close, and shake it when you are going to use it: a table-spoonful of this is sufficient for a quart of milk. It must be prepared in very cool weather, and if well done, will keep more than a year.

As you can see, cheese was a very labor intensive process. But Randolph, who was the sister of Thomas Mann Randolph, husband of Martha ""Patsy"" Jefferson, wasn't the first to publish such recipes in America. In 1769 a cookbook by Elizabeth Raffald was published in England and spread to the colonial printshops across the Atlantic. It had numerous recipes involving curds or cheese, such as;

>To make Cheese-Cake.

>SET a quart of new milk near the fire, with 
a spoonful of rennet, let the milk be blood warm, 
when it is broke, drain the curd through a coarse 
cloth, now and then break the curd gently with your fingers, rub into the curd a quarter of a 
pound of butter, a quarter of a pound of sugar 
a nutmeg, and two Naples biscuits grated, the 
yolks, of four, eggs, and the white of one egg 
one ounce of almonds well beat, with two 
spoonfuls of rose water, and two of sack, clean 
six ounces of currants very well, put them into 
your curd, and mix them all well together

>To make Curd Puffs. 

>TAKE two quarts of milk, put a little run- 
net in it, when it is broke, put it in a coarse cloth 
to drain, then rub the curd through a hair sieve 
with four ounces of butter beat, ten ounces of 
bread, half a nutmeg, and a lemon peel grated, 
a spoonful of wine, and sugar to your taste, rub 
your cups with butter, and bake them a little 
more than half an hour

Or;

>To make a Ramequin of Cheese. 

>TAKE some old Chediire cheese, a lump 
of butter, and the yolk of a hard boiled egg, 
and beat it very well together in a marble mor- 
tar, spread it on some dices of bread toasted and 
buttered; hold a salamander over them, and 
send them up

It is also Raffald's recipe for Macaroni and Parmesan Cheese in this book that is generally credited as the first modern macaroni and cheese recipe."
AskHistorians,"When it comes to female blacksmiths, TV Tropes states: ""Notable is that historically, contrary to stereotypes, women were regularly involved in the [smithing] trade. It was still male-dominated, but several of the disciplines (nails, pins, chains) were almost exclusively women."" How true is this?","If you check out the [full quote](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/13926/pg13926-images.html#NAILS) from Hutton, it reads a bit differently:

>When I first approached her [Birmingham], from Walsall, in 1741, I was surprized at the prodigious number of blacksmiths shops upon the road; and could not conceive how a country, though populous, could support so many people of the same occupation. In some of these shops I observed one, or more females, stript of their upper garment, and not overcharged with their lower, wielding the hammer with all the grace of the sex. The beauties of their face were rather eclipsed by the smut of the anvil; or, in poetical phrase, the tincture of the forge had taken possession of those lips, which might have been taken by the kiss.

>Struck with the novelty, I inquired, ""Whether the ladies in this country shod horses?"" but was answered, with a smile, ""They are nailers.""

He's right, that Birmingham was quite the ironworking center in the 18th c. It's hard to jump to the conclusion that these jobs are filled ""exclusively"" by women; Hutton is struck with the novelty of one or more women in some of the many blacksmith shops. But we do have evidence of women in such trades: Denis Diderot's Encyclopedia has an [engraving of a needlemaking shop that's mostly women](https://www.alamy.com/18th-century-illustration-of-making-needles-published-in-a-diderot-pictorial-encyclopedia-of-trades-and-industry-manufacturing-and-the-technical-ar-image362164171.html?imageid=1AFEE026-DE0B-4B06-AD46-838195DD2F13&p=1257516&pn=1&searchId=696ac8074653104521746c1d16aea58b&searchtype=0). Both these needlemakers and the nailers were doing small work (rod for making nails would be around 5 mm, so holding a few lengths of it in even a smaller hand for each heat was not difficult). Women were considered to be more deft. And as they had to be making a *lot* of nails and needles, deft was very important. 

But there were a lot of different kinds of smiths; a hammer and a forge would be part of making many things. Deft women would be wanted for making nails and needles, but strong oafs with heavy hammers would be wanted for work like [forging and welding heavy wagon tires](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/heavy-smithy-gm541991310-96944005).

AskHistorians,Why did Vermont have a massive Merino Sheep boom and bust in the 19th century (A peak of 70% of the land was devoted to sheep). What market forces were at play?,"Finally question that I'm actually perfectly situated to answer. The first family to import Marino sheep to the United States were the Robinsons who owned the Rokeby Farm, which is now the Vermont underground railroad museum. The Robinson's bought the farm around 1800 and were active in the abolitionist movement as devout Quakers. In the 1700s in Northern Vermont as in much the rest of New England, the colonists had cleared land trying to recreate the landscape of their native British isles. The rolling Green mountains were basically bare below any major elevation and sheep wool was seen as a good crop for Northern New England, as it was in the homeland. The small Urban centers of Burlington, and those closer to Boston like Manchester had begun to industrialize textile manufacture as had been pioneered in the UK. To develop in the same way New England would need not just the industrial machinery, but also a great source of raw material. For most of the Northeast the raw material would be cotton produced by slave labor in the south, but there was still money to be made in wool. 

Now back to the Robinsons. They were the first family in all of the United States to import Marino sheep, and over time it made them quite wealthy. They grew the sheep to sheer, but also bred and sold them widely. The family became so well off, that one of their members eventually became the American ambassador to the Habsburg court in Austria. Merino wool is as warming and easy to work with as other varieties, but is much softer on the skin. It easily caught on and became a standard of expensive woolen goods. 

Implied by your question is the obvious next step of what market forces led to the downfall of wool as the Vermont staple crop. Three things combine to explain how wool lost its crown in the Vermont world of agriculture. The first is competition. The so-called squatters of Australia and colonists in New Zealand began to produce huge amounts of wool to ship back to the British empire which out competed wall products grown in the United States. By the time the 1800s were rounding out this competition was getting quite strong and at the same time agricultural competition from Western States prevented Vermont from moving back into wheat and fruit which had been the main agricultural products beforehand. The development of railroads, especially after mid-century made Vermont's cold weather in rocky soil hardset to compete with many other regions in the agriculture game not just the far-flung Australian sheep farmers. The solution in the 1900s was to move into dairy which had also been supported by trains. Trains allowed rural Vermont Farmers to ship milk to places like New York and Boston and earn a good price. Especially with the development of better refrigeration systems by the mid-1900s Vermont to become a full-on dairy state.

Edit: typos, I apologize for the wonky structure of this, I'm on my phone. Also I forgot to mention that Merino wool is still used to make socks in Vermont by the awesome Darn Tough Sock Company."
AskHistorians,Why was John Steinbecks's win for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature controversial?,"I am getting my PhD in poetry, but I think I can answer this question alright.

A lot of the reasons why are illustrated by a New York Times response from '62 in which they wrote that Steinbeck had ""limited talent...watered down by tenth-rate philosophizing..."" and when Steinbeck was asked if he should have won, he responded,""Frankly, no.""

The Nobel Prize revealed 50 years later that Steinbeck was chosen out of Robert Graves, Lawrence Durrell, Jean Anouilh, and Karen Blixen. No offense to any of these authors, and I have read all but Anouilh, but this is a fairly weak group of writers for the Nobel Prize. So part of the reason, too, was that Steinbeck was thought of as a compromise winner.

Another thing was that typically the Nobel Prize is awarded to different nations over time, with some exceptions, and so some authors felt if someone won from their nation then they might not win (since you cannot win a Nobel posthumously). You can see this in Yukio Mishima's reaction to Yasunari Kawabata, though people were not mad about Kawabata winning; however Mishima did not feel he could win (and another Japanese writer would not win until the 90's when the recently departed Kenzaburo Oe won). So Steinbeck winning would have made people feel that other American writers' chances of winning were much lower.

There were a few American writers who won fairly recently before Steinbeck, like Hemingway and Faulkner, who Steinbeck was always in the shadow of. There were other writers who had already been nominated several times without winning who even in the moment people felt were more deserving: E.M Forster, future winner Jean-Paul Sartre, Robert Frost, controversial Ezra Pound, Jorge Luis Borges, Graham Greene, future winner Pablo Neruda, Sean O'Casey, and Jun'ichiro Tanizaki. Some of these people won, and some did not, but all have been more well regarded, on a literary level, than Steinbeck.

Personally, I like Steinbeck's work, but I do not feel he should have won the Nobel Prize. However, a lot of people have the Nobel that history does not regard as the most interesting writers of their time (look back at some of the original winners and see if you have heard any of them). The great thing about the Nobel is that it allows people to go back and look at great writers, but to also get a sense of how history regards writers differently over time. There have been other writers, like personal favorite Tomas Transtromer, who were controversial at first, but now people highly regard that choice.

Edited to fix a few errors I missed and to say I enjoyed seeing a literary history question on here that I could answer."
AskHistorians,"How do historians decide where a state, nation, or nation-state begins to exist and ceases to exist? What is the basis for historical ""identity""?","I'd agree with the flair- great question! As this is a contentious subject I'm sure others will chime in to contribute, but I'll try and give an overview of the *frame* of the question at hand here. That you are seeing inconsistency is the key here- it is inconsistent, and a large part of that is that this isn't a solved subject.

What constitutes a polity and its extension through time and space? In the modern day we often think of ""the state""- a huge complex of officials, politicians, the public sector, the military etc., and the area they control. Whether and how the population in that area relates to the state is something people have differing opinions on these days- to some, the people constitute the state as equal citizens, and to others this is a fairy tale, and we simply live our lives while states share out the globe. What constitutes the state here is the *institutions of state*, the structure of the military, the offices of the executive, the laws of courts. So long as there is a hierarchy and chain of reference that leads back to the centre (e.g., something being the **U.S.** Department of bla bla, taking orders from the president, etc.), then we see it as one state. This is a very positive-law and technocratic outlook on the world, drawing from folks like Kelsen, Hart, and others.

A somewhat more 20th-century view of things, though it still constitutes many people's view of states, is the *nation state*. Here, a nation is preconceived- often as a historical entity, tied together through blood, language, religion or something else- and the state is the instantiation or *self-determination* of that nation. Here, the continuity of the state or empire takes second place to the continuity of the nation. Fascistic ideas of a master race are extreme examples of this, of course, but you can see the political necessity for the nation from the postcolonial and post-imperial non-European states and their attempts to excavate an ethnic national history in the early 20th century (see the Sun Language Theory in Turkey or the Indigenous Aryanism of India). 

Earlier still, one might speak of an Imperial frame of statehood (used loosely). The Holy Roman Empire, the Russian Tsardom, and the Ottoman Empire all perceived and represented themselves as heirs to the Roman Imperial tradition- despite making much less of an argument for any blood or ethnic relation, much less one of direct legal equivalence. Here, the recognition of some great imperial framework is the basis, and states that fill the space are taken as potential successors, their victory dependent on their fulfilment of the supposed past glory. China is perhaps the chief example of this, where the relatively stable geography for the ""Middle Kingdom"" imperial space did not die out, and successive polities sought to claim it as their title.

Fİnally, you can have a dynastic notion of a polity. A given structure, people or imperial space here is second to lineage. The post-Mongol Central Asia is a great example of this, as the many khandoms that reigned until the 18th-19th centuries touted their Chinggisid heritage, or otherwise conjured some near-dynastic relation to the Chinggisids (an example is the Russian Tsar naming himself Khan in the 16th century due to his suzerainty over the Chinggisid Kasim clan). Another example is the dynastic politics of Early Modern Europe, with families like the Hapsburgs holding seemingly completely unrelated lands through marriage and inheritance.

These don't cover all the options, and of course you don't have to choose one or the other; my point in listing these is that for any given person, their understanding of what a state or polity is is going to be a jumble of these and other ideas layered on top of one another. Additionally, any example you think of will be embedded in its own context- you can't really talk about a Habsburg ""nation"" before the 18th century, or an uninterrupted French state structure until at least the mid-17th, or any dynastic link from Qin Shi Huang to Empress Dowager Cixi; more importantly, in many such cases the people of the time would have no idea what you meant by ""nation"" or ""state"" or ""administration"", and where they did have equivalents it would be far removed from our modern context.

The challenge, at the end of the day, is that this is a question that lies at the overlap of multiple disciplines, and academics often don't like crossing those lines. You might get polisci folks giving you clean-cut Weberian definitions, or historians telling you any word that comes out of your mouth is anachronism (the cardinal sin!). The fact of the matter is that this is an issue that is not resolved. Should we categorise the Later Han and the Dutch Republic as in the same category, but just subdivided? Or are they different things altogether, and there's no overarching term? Should we even categorise at all, or just refer to the terms used within the context we are discussing? Historians and social scientists alike have no consensus on the matter, so like I wrote at the start, your confusion just shows you've perceived this.

I'll end on a more resolute point, however (and hereon is more opinion). Just because academics have not come to an agreement, does not mean that there is not an answer. More immediately, that there is no definitive, analytically clean answer does not mean that there are not *practical answers*. That's why people still refer to the Roman Empire, the United States, the Russian Tsardom etc. Complex as the nitty gritty might be, we gotta do history - and so we use these terms we're used to, and worry about the imperfections when they arise. These terms can be replaced- but they need to be replaced by *something*. As much as academics discuss, the prevalence of these terms won't go away unless some practical alternative is provided- and I don't just mean a different term to take their exact place, but some different *practice* if such clumping together is argued to be bad. So keep in mind that this doesn't have to be an unanswerable, never-ending question. We're just working with older tools that are beginning to give to the depredations of time, and though many notice this, a contender is yet to emerge to take their place. 

**TL;DR**: It is complicated, historians and other scholars are still arguing about it, but there is space for new ideas and suggestions."
AskHistorians,Why did Modern Greece abandon its Byzantine identity in favor of Ancient Greece?,[removed]
AskHistorians,The new weekly theme is: Hinduism !,Thanks
AskHistorians,How has the U.S. largely eliminated public smoking while Europe has not?,"Going to try and answer with that caveat that I am more familiar with the legal aspects of this than the cultural ones. A lot of measures to prevent smoking have been introduced in the last 20 years, so you can't talk about those without breaking the 20 year rule (I think?). Greece introduced a smoking ban in public and private workplaces in 2003, Ireland in 2004, Portugal, Sweden, Italy in 2005, UK in 2007 etc.

So answering your question without analysis of those measures is going to be a bit difficult. But arguably the simplest solution is just: ""the measures are quite new, so they just haven't been fully accepted yet"". If we do go further back than 2003, the first serious measures to ban smoking in public places are introduced in California in the 90s (1994 for restaurants and 1998 for other places serving food & drink) and in New York in a partial form in 2002 before more general implementation in 2003. A strong part of the argument behind those measures was dealing with the impact of secondhand smoke (also true in newer measures in Europe) and the emphasis on the disparate impact it has on the ""non-privileged"" (minorities, poorer sections of society). You can also argue that the federal structure of the US makes it easier for lobbying organisations to push changes at the state-level, whereas in many European countries any change has to be national-level (see above examples).

By contrast in Europe smoking is probably more culturally accepted than in the United States (varies by region) and at the EU level any legislative competence is directed to supplement member states rather than legislate in their place (Art. 168 TFEU *formerly Art. 152 TEC*), with member states being hostile to the idea of any top-down legislation on a topic like this, much less 20 years ago. There is also an argument by at least one of the authors below (which I think I agree with) that approaches to pluralism in Europe mean smoking is still viewed primarily as a individual issue, with less focus on broader consequences (harm from 2nd-hand smoke, young people picking up the habit) which forms the more positive view of smokers in public spaces.

**So in America**:  
\-Smoking is a social issue, emphasis on second order effects, harm to poor or minorities  
\-American Federal structure means pressure groups can effectuate law reform  
\-Smoking might be more negatively viewed anyway  
**Whereas in Europe**:-Less stigma around smoking because it's an individual issue -> Pluralism is seen to include right to be able to smoke if you so want  
\-EU can't legislate on it, competence down to member states, who are reluctant to do so, only did so within the last 20 years.

AskHistorians,"What was ""The Fire Nation"" listed on old maps of what is now the US Midwest? What became of it?","This map has various names associated with it onlije - I've seen it attributed to Chatelain and Suetter and others - from everywhere between 1719 and 1745. I am not sure of its provenance but we can still check in on the contents of the map itself. 

The map is showing primarily French territories, but as they would relate to the various native bands and nations in the area. 

The French had long been [exploring, trading, and settling](https://www.loc.gov/collections/pioneering-the-upper-midwest/articles-and-essays/history-of-the-upper-midwest-overview/french-lead-the-way/) in the Midwest by that time, and missionaries sent to convert the indigenous people often kept detailed records of their experiences. 

 But each missionary was left to rely on their own understanding of the native languages they encountered, which is where the Fire Nation comes in. 

There are some accounts from [Jesuits](https://web.archive.org/web/20160321002351/http://www.puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_55.html) at the time that put this down to simple misunderstanding - ""fire"" comes from part of the Fox word (I believe in the Algonquin language tree) for people of the Prairie or Plains - making this a simple misunderstanding of the people we know as Mascouten. 

Whether this map refers to Mascouten itself is tough to say, because the Huron and Iriqouis and even the Menomonee in Wisconsin called [various tribes](http://www.dickshovel.com/mas.html) ""people of the fire"" or ""keepers of the fire"" or ""fire nations"" that settled along what we now know as the Wisconsin and Illinois border. 

Add to that the even more confusing facts that the Mascouten had long been traveling around the Great Lakes, beset with fighting from the Iriqouis Nations east of Lake Michigan, and with the various tribes that occupied areas near what is today Milwaukee. At various times several bands of Mascouten were migrating to and fro on the western shore of Lake Michigan, with Mascouten men and women intermarrying with Fox, Miami, and other tribes for reasons of love, security, convenience, and survival depending on the season and situation with neighboring tribes. 

However, Mascouten is likely a good bet. Since we can look at other [similar maps](https://sanderusmaps.com/our-catalogue/antique-maps/america/north-america/canada-by-zacharias-chatelain) and see a similar name but with some version of ""mascouten"" attached to it."
AskHistorians,"It's the 1300s, England, and after one too many ales I've suggested publicly that my hog could do a better job of running the country than the king (and we slaughtered the hog last winter.) How much trouble am I in?","The view of medieval England  governed by tyrannical kings and sycophantic courts with a healthy dose of ""off with his head!"" is fairly common but unfortunately not completely accurate (although it does make for good stories/TV),


The Magna Carta is of particular interest here as it does lay down provisions from which we can work out what, if any, punishment you would hypothetically face, it's also something I would recommend looking at to give a sense of perspective, the medieval world wasn't as backwards or barbaric as many would believe,

Firstly, medieval England post 1215 (where the Fourth Lateran Council effectively banned the trial by ordeal by stopping priests from being involved in them)was very quick to set up and maintain courts and juries and trials as a primary means to determine guilt, in comparison to medieval France where the confession of the defendant -possibly through torture - was used to determine guilt more often, although medieval England did use torture, it was usually either the ruling of a jury/trial or to force the defendant to agree to jury trial in the first place)

(The juries here would decide guilt or innocence fairly quickly from the records we have, and the punishments were rarely death, and were usually fines or possibly some physical punishment, from what we can see)


In England in 1215 the Magna Carta had been signed by the king, essentially this document guaranteed, among other things:

A) the right of a free man to not be victimised or attacked in any way ""except by lawful judgement of his peers ... or by the law of the land"" (the 14th amendment of the US Constitution echoes this charter fairly closely, along with the Bill of Rights, and the right to due legal process remains on statute in England and Wales to this day)

B) limits on the power of the king in regard to punishing nobles (echoing the 14th declaration Charter of Liberties signed by Henry I in 1100 AD, but with actual power to enforce them, which the 1100 charter did not have, it was a nice thought though)

The Magna Carta laid down a number of laws that were only repealed in the 19th century or later, and a number of the laws do appear to be (to a lay person/non lawyer) fairly progressive and logical (and if you remove royals/barons from certain statements and replace it with President/congress, they could be mistaken (by someone with little knowledge admittedly) for a section from the US Constitution or Bill of Rights)

Also it is interesting to note that whilst capital punishment was available, there were a number of ways to lessen this punishment or even avoid punishment completely, so death was fairly rarely given out as a punishment - killing off peasents or nobles was even in the 1300s known to be a method of last resort 

Given these facts, you would not be executed or accused of treason based off of a drunken statement, laws, juries and courts still existed even in those times and no man, not even the king could pass a sentence arbitrarily without going through some legal process, and death was reserved for more significant crimes, and even in the 13th century you could argue that you were not in a sound state of mind (either through youth, drunkenness, mentally unwell, or being forced into saying/doing something against your will) you could face a lesser punishment

Most likely (assuming you are some noble) a fine would be issued to you if multiple witnesses attested to your statement (the Magna Carta also had declarations including that no man could be put on trial based on the unsupported word of a royal official) by another baron/earl (the king was limited on who he could fine without his nobles/court agreeing with him)  but the fine would specifically not bankrupt you, just be painful (bankrupting nobles based on drunken statements was a quick route to rebellion), fines were very popular since they were another way for kings to get money from their (possibly) rich underlings especially as maintaining a royal court was very expensive, with physical punishments doled out much less frequently than fines 

For the statement from a drunken peasant, this wasn't the Stasi or anything like that, it would almost certainly be ignored if anyone even bothered to report it, worse case scenario would be probably again some fine based on what a local judge thought, since killing peasants based on drunken statements set a bad precedent and rebellions had been started over less"
AskHistorians,How did U.S. Military operational codenames become so dramatic?,"This [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2qxj4w/when_did_military_operations_start_to_be_given/cnaug2h/) from a ways back by u/lukemacu has some relevant history around operation code names. 

Specifically in the US case, Just Cause for the 1989 invasion of Panama is the first example of the modern ""marketing"" style of operation code name. This developed from the 1975 introduction of the computerized Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System (itself shortened to NICKA). Using this unified system as a common database, the Joint Chiefs of Staff assigned 24 different Department of Defense components, agencies and commands a series of two alphabetical letters to use the assigned component's/command's staff then use the letters to generate operation names. In 1983 US Atlantic Command had UR as one of its codes, and therefore chose ""Urgent Fury"" for its operation name for the 1983 invasion of Grenada. But this was something of an outlier (and it was mocked in the US press), and it should be contrasted with operation names like Eldorado Canyon for the 1986 airstrikes against Libya, Praying Mantis for 1988 air strikes targeting Iranian assets, and Golden Pheasant, also in 1988 for operations directed against Nicaragua.

The change that started with Panama came at the urging of US Army Lieutenant General Thomas W. Kelly, who was in charge of the Pentagon's National Military Command Center (which handled press briefings), and who had a degree in journalism. This was at the urging of General James J. Lindsay, Commander in Chief of Special Operations command, who reputedly told Kelly: ""Do you want your grandchildren to say you were in Blue Spoon?"" Kelly worked on alternatives with another general and they finally hit on ""Just Cause"", and the trend started from there, continuing with Desert Shield the following year, and Desert Storm the year after.

Another notable change that happened at this time is that operation codenames took on much larger roles than they had previously, when an operation was just that - a particular plan for a particular action within a larger war (Operation Overlord being a few weeks' of a campaign in Northern France in 1944, or Operation Cedar Falls being a three-week search and destroy mission in Vietnam in 1967). Starting with Desert Shield, operation names became much more broadly encompassing, often denoting an *entire* conflict, and not just a single operational action within it, assuming the two were even indistinguishable. So for example ""Desert Storm"" itself became a shorthand for the whole war against Iraq in 1991, which in some ways is a bit confusing in that the air campaign, the Battle of Khafji, and the ground offensive technically were all very different things in that one operation, and that in an earlier era might have been labeled distinctly (which *did* get other branded names, although these are less well-known: the ground offensive was Desert Saber, the redeployment out of theater was Desert Farewell, the distribution of postwar aid was Desert Share, etc.). 

Naming US military operations very much has been a branding exercise since, and this very much as an eye towards public relations, often relying directly on media coverage for feedback - a 1991 relief effort in Bangladesh was originally named Operation Productive Effort, but Colin Powell disliked it, and the operation was renamed Operation Sea Angel based off of coverage of the already-underway operation. The US military has gotten much savvier since then about what sort of message it wants to convey to the public with operation names, and how well names are received by the media."
AskHistorians,"Rugby is the only sport in which Ireland compete as one team instead of dividing between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. Why is that and were there any problems during ""The Troubles""?","The Irish Rugby Football Union has, since its formation in 1879, represented the whole of Ireland (though, incidentally, rugby isn't unique in that respect), and the single team persisted through the War of Independence and the Troubles. There were certainly political difficulties through the years - matches were played in both Dublin and Belfast until the 1950s, with the national anthem of the respective country beforehand, and in 1954 some players were planning on staying in the changing room in Belfast until the anthems had finished, but a senior member of the IRFU pointed out: ""The only point of unity on this island is the rugby union. The lads in the north have been coming down to Lansdowne Road for all these years and standing to attention for *Amhran na bhFiann* and, therefore, I think we should be standing to attention for the anthem that's recognised up here. I'm telling you, fellas, if you go ahead and do what you're planning to do then it will be the end of the rugby union as we know it."" 

At the height of the Troubles in 1972 there were concerns over safety, not within the squad but from visiting unions; Scotland and Wales both cancelled visits to Dublin for the Five Nations, putting the future of the competition at risk, but England travelled in 1973 (captain John Pullin's post-match speech apparently consisted of ""We may not be any good, but at least we turn up."") There was also letter on Sinn Fein headed notepaper during New Zealand's 1973 tour warning that their safety could not be guaranteed (though one of the purported signatories says it was a hoax, possibly a loyalist black operation), but nothing more came of it. As Willie John McBride (one of the great Irish captains) said, ""Throughout the murder and mayhem in Northern Ireland there wasn't a single game of rugby ever cancelled between a team from the north and a team from the south. We crossed over the border all the time to play against each other and the game was a great unifier in tough times.""

Rugby Union was an amateur game until the 1990s so the players all had jobs; during the 1980s two of the team were policemen in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and second row Brian McCall was a Captain in the British Army packing down next to Donal Lenihan, whose grandfather was an Irish Volunteer in the War of Independence. In the words of another second row, Moss Keane, ""But that was the thing about playing with the northern boys: we transcended politics. It didn't take too long for me to reconcile my Republican heritage with the diverse political and religious background of my team-mates. There was no border in the Irish dressing room.""

AskHistorians,"What’s the oldest language that, with what we know, one could learn and reasonably expect an actual speaker of it (from its original time period) to understand?","Likely Akkadian! There are several reasons our knowledge of Sumerian is imperfect, namely that it’s a language isolate, conveyed through a mix of logograms (single signs representing an entire noun/adj./verb) and phonetic signs, and that we only know the sounds associated with Sumerian as they’ve been conveyed by Akkadian bilingual texts. Whereas with Akkadian there are several reasons we can be reasonably certain of our reconstruction of how it sounded and was spoken. The biggest reason that we can restore how it sounded is that Akkadian was written syllabically, with signs that represented clearly differentiated syllables like ba, shum, a, etc. Linguists can then take these sounds represented in the writing and reconstruct how they were actually pronounced using comparative semetics: Akkadian is a part of the semetic language family and so is related to really well understood language such as Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic. With such a large sample size of related languages which have been recorded over thousands of years scholars are able to trace the development of sounds and the specific ways that it was pronounced, down to regional dialects and accents in Akkadian. Our understanding is further buttressed by later forms of Akkadian being rendered in scripts other than cuneiform on occasion, such as Akkadian names (which were actually all complete sentences in and of themselves) being rendered in the Hebrew script in the Bible, etc. And then we can understand how it was spoken via texts which record direct speech, and letters which use language and grammar more akin to how it was spoken in daily life. 

Given that Akkadian is one of the oldest recorded languages, with its first uncontested attestations coming from ~2400 BCE, around the same time that Egyptian first began conveying grammar in their writing, and ~800-1000 years after the first attestations of Sumerian, I’d say it’s definitely the oldest language we can reconstruct how it was spoken, and if we were to encounter a native speaker, actually be able to communicate. Ancient Greek is better understood, and better reconstructed as a whole, due to the immense amount of scholarship devoted to it and the surprising amount of continuity between Ancient Greek and its modern descendants, but Akkadian would be the first attested language that you could learn and reasonably expect to be able to communicate with a native speaker in if you somehow encountered one.

For further reading and a brief overview I would recommend reading the introduction in John Huehnergard’s A Grammar of Akkadian and his appendices on phonology!"
AskHistorians,"How do I, as a layman, know if a book is academically respected and historically sound or not?","1) It is very rare if not impossible to find a single authoritative text on a subject. Even well respected academic texts are debated and are likely infused with biases. In general it is important to read texts from multiple perspectives and take note of how different authors use the same primary sources differently. 

2) Books published by academic presses are peer reviewed, which adds another layer of credibility to these texts that you will not find in a trade book. This is by no means a perfect system, but I suggest paying attention to who the book publisher is (for example, Princeton University Press, or Duke University Press). Certain subjects tend to gravitate to different presses so I can’t advise which presses to look out for. 


3) Many academic press books have published reviews in academic journals which you can consult.

4) If you are studying a subject I advise to google the subject + “library guide” “lib guide” or “subject guide”. These key words will help you find guides prepared by research librarians on the subject. This is a very standard way to get an overview of the field and to find a number of canonical books or articles on the subject."
AskHistorians,"Scientists recently authenticated several 3rd century Roman coins showing an otherwise-unattested emperor Sponsian. If he did in fact exist, what was his likely fate?","We simply don't know what happened to Sponsianus - last week we didn't even know he existed! But I think it's really important we talk about how we refer to him - headlines have been calling him a ""lost emperor"", but we have to remember that he never ruled *the* ""Roman Empire"" as it is popularly understood.

During the 240s CE the empire was in disarray, under Emperor Phillip the Arab many of the far-flung provinces were being lost or cut off. One of these was Dacia, in modern Transylvania (and Oltenia and Banat), a remote outpost of the Empire surrounded by enemies. Dacia was not lost until the 270s, under Emperor Aurelian, but during Phillip the Arab's time it was temporarily cut off from Rome.

With a population of several thousand Romans and potentially up to a million Romanised (to a lesser or greater extent... Some were loyal Romans, se were in open rebellion, we'll probably never know the statistics) Dacians being cut off like this was terrifying. With the power of Rome lost, Sponsianus was able to declare himself emperor - but only of Dacia. He never ruled outside that area.

We simply don't know what happened to him when the lost province was reconnected. He might have already been dead. Either way, by 275 the Romans had evacuated their military and administrative assets for redeployment.

What's very interesting though is that we're already seeing the fight for Sponsianus's reputation. The researchers who proved his existence have been keen to label him a reluctant ruler stepping up when Rome failed, others have called him a usurper. Without any more substantial evidence than two coins, we'll almost certainly never know much more than we do now."
AskHistorians,"Why are figures like Genghis Khan or Attila, who committed massive genocides, revered and described as ""conquerors"" instead of being repudiated for their atrocities?","Well I can answer a bit re the Mongols. Basically the answer is they used to be seen as complete villains with a big emphasis on conquest and massacre and then historians started emphasizing the more positive traits of Mongol rule, especially one historian, Jack Weatherford, whose book *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World* (2004) was really popular. After that textbooks have changed and much more literature in that vein has been written. But Weatherford’s book is particularly readable. Speaking for myself I read it in high school and was at the time something of a fanboy.

And there certainly were positives. Under the Mongol Empire, unification of most of Eurasia meant a lot of peace and free trade—and thus they can be credited with the [EDIT: reestablishment on a basis independent of the Muslim world] of the famous Silk Road that properly inspired Europeans to seek trade with the Far East. There’s a lot of “when the Mongols were in charge, a virgin could walk from one side of Asia to another with a pot of gold on her head and fear nothing” kind of stories associated with their rule. The Mongols were famously religiously tolerant. They were relatively feminist compared to the societies they conquered. Genghis Khan himself has a pretty fascinating life story and there is a sympathetic quality to the story of an underdog uniting his nation and outlawing all the offenses that had plagued it—slavery, kidnapping, feuds, etc. That’s the revisionist narrative anyway.

There’s also the impressive military achievements of the Mongols in uniting steppe horse archery to greater discipline and siege warfare technology—and using that to conquer almost everyone they encountered. Jack Weatherford also threw some doubt at at least some of the massacre numbers and lurid tales of gruesome executions thrown around by medieval chroniclers—by no means always reliable sources.

This revisionism came amid a general climate of reevaluating nonwestern history—which can be seen from one angle as apologism or nationalism and there’s some truth to that—but from another fair angle it meant trying to maintain the same standards. Why should a conqueror like Alexander or the truly bloodthirsty crusaders get romanticized (as they often were in Western history at the time) and Asian conquerors be treated as Conan villains regularly compared to Hitler?

The revisionist narrative also dovetailed nicely with the revival of Mongolia as a nation. Mongolian culture was attacked under communist rule and the Mongolian overthrow of communism was a rare beacon of democracy in post-soviet Central Asia. Naturally, Mongolians were eager to rehabilitate and celebrate their era of imperial glory—which they had been pretty much forbidden to do before. Since Mongolians have a pretty beautiful culture and it’s easy to sympathize with a democratic people trying to fight off coup attempts and invasions, it’s easy for westerners to go along with their historical revisions—especially when some of the empire’s biggest victims (i.e. China, Russia and a chunk of the Muslim world) are the West’s current geopolitical rivals!

That said it’s not like the massacre and conquest part has gone away. Weatherford doesn’t even try to deny the impact of the sack of Baghdad as far as I recall, just exempts certain Mongol leaders who had already died of blame for it. There’s what they did in Russia, etc etc etc it can hardly all be denied and I don’t think even the revisionists go so far as to do so. There’s certainly truth in the critique that the history of the mongols as evil monsters had been written by their enemies and that they had achievements. But they certainly *were* brutal conquerors who killed a *lot* of people."
AskHistorians,How did Christian Science Monitor become a well respected source of journalism despite being owned by an anti-science cult?,"> *""""One of the Monitor's great achievements has been to maintain a century-long reputation for fairness and balance when many other media organizations are accused of bias and lack of objectivity,""* - John Hughes, former editor for the *Monitor*.

To understand why the *Monitor* is so trusted, we must go over a few points: 

* despite a religious article always being at the end of every issue (as requested by Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy), the Monitor does not promote the doctrine of the Church of Christ, Scientist. This is an interesting decision - in its article on [the paper's first hundred years](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1125/p25s08-usgn.html), the paper notes that Mary Eddy was determined to make sure that the paper's connection to the church was known, but this later led to conflicts involving [the board of trustees](https://www.nytimes.com/1919/03/29/archives/christian-science-in-junction-holds-continued-by-court-pending.html)

* The *Monitor* avoids sensationalism.  In a [2005 article for the *Boston Globe*](https://web.archive.org/web/20080908040220/http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2005/06/09/appealing_to_a_higher_authority/), Alex Beam writes: 

> *”The Web works well for the Monitor because it publishes the paper's distinctive brand of nonhysterical journalism -- let's just say the Michael Jackson trial isn't exactly front and center in the Monitor's pages -- in real time.”*

And building off of this, the *Monitor* itself writes [on its ""About"" page](https://www.csmonitor.com/About):

> *""We need you to hold us accountable – to keep us honest and grounded. To inspire us with what inspires you. Together, we can build a community of people who ask more from news.""*

As well as:

> *""[The] Monitor is committed to delivering news that is factual. Our bias is to present the world through a lens that is calm and measured, as well as characterized by honesty, fairness, compassion, respect, and goodness. We dare to see the world differently, but not by ignoring the challenges the world faces. Instead, we report stories that illustrate a path to progress or illuminate the ways of thinking that motivate people to act the way they do, shedding light on possibilities for how to move forward. We neither give in to fear nor incite it, but we strive to provide readers with facts and perspectives they can use to think for themselves and draw their own conclusions.*

It also helps that the *Monitor* is a non-profit as it is a part of the church despite its non-promotion of Christian Science. They write:

> *""We are an independent voice, devoid of the corporate allegiances and pressures that critics say too often skew today's media. We seek to give our readers the information they need to come to their own constructive conclusions... The Monitor is funded by revenue from subscriptions, an endowment fund, donations, gifts, and profits from the Publishing Society. Additional funding to cover operating costs is provided by The First Church of Christ, Scientist. The Monitor also accepts outside grants to support general operations, special projects, and coverage of specific topics of interest to our readers, but without ceding any editorial independence.""*

Being a non-profit, like CSPAN or the Associated Press, allows it to not have to be sensational for clicks (and therefore more money, though they do need to keep the lights on) in a way that hasn’t worked for for-profit journalism such as (for example) the unbiased attempt of NewsNation. Mind you, this has become more prevalent in an era where [such sensationalism has become even more important as print declines and the internet booms](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-34213693.amp), but [especially as news sites rely more on those internet numbers, forcing them to use these tactics to pull in more clicks](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/the_mission_sounds_simple_pay.php), as in this example quoted from my CJR citation:

> *Slant is far from unique in this respect and this business model is becoming increasingly common, but opponents argue it means journalists will dumb down stories in order to get more clicks in order to earn a living.*

In a way, it has worked for them; despite its print numbers declining (as of this post, they stand at about 72,000 - which is more than it was when that *Boston Globe* article came out - but is no longer daily but rather weekly), the paper has remained popular online. In his book on the paper, author Keith Collins noted that by 2011 the site had 22 million hits per month - this rivaled the *Los Angeles Times*.

Now, how did it get here though?

To understand this part, we must consider the impacts yellow journalism and its aftermath had on the founding of the *Monitor*. One of the biggest proponents of yellow journalism was Joseph Pulitzer, and later in his life Pulitzer had reversed his yellow tactics in favor of its roots; in turn, he not only restored the reputation of his *World* paper, but also had called out Eddy. 

When she founded the newspaper in 1908, Mary Eddy set out to do so for a few reasons. One of these was the constant criticism of her and her church from the *New York World* - despite Pulitzer's attempts to raise the reputation of his paper, his team in the year and a half prior wrote that [Eddy was senile, dying of an ailment, and decrepit](https://www.longyear.org/learn/research-archive/next-friends-suit-1907/) - though I could not find the exact newspaper cited - and she set out to retaliate against this with [her own response](https://www.longyear.org/wp-content/uploads/1995/09/Capture7-1024x350.jpg). However, she also saw the fear that such sensational reporting caused. She wrote:

> *Looking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally reflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease seems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to many minds, to be depicted in some future time upon the body. A periodical of our own will counteract to some extent this public nuisance; for through our paper, at the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able to reach many homes with healing, purifying thought.*

In his accounts, [Frederic Moritz](https://www.worldlymind.org/conscience.pdf) - a [former *Monitor* employee from the 1970s until the early 1990s](https://www.csmonitor.com/content/advancedsearch?SearchText=Frederic+A.+Moritz&PhraseSearchText=Frederic+a.+moritz&SearchDate=-1&SearchPageLimit=2&SearchButton=Search) - expressed that Pulitzer and Eddy were both extremely impactful on journalism but also had similarities to each other. He notes how Eddy attempted to present her paper: 

> *""Like the ""new"" *New York Times*, the *Monitor* stood for amore elevated discussion of public issues, seeking to supply context and perspective. Unlike ""Yellow Journalism,"" it tended to screen out emotion and gripping, graphic portrayals of how ""ordinary people"" lived. It was sometimes seen as a paper of ""the head,"" not ""the heart.""*

This seems to suggest that the *Monitor* was meant to be a more rational answer to the sensationalist views of papers like Pulitzer's and other former ""yellow journalists."" He also expands on another era - when the *Monitor* took on McCarthyism:

> *""One example of how an emphasis on issues rather than personalities could be powerful journalism came in The
Monitor's coverage of ""McCarthyism."" Richard L. Strout, a non-Christian Scientist who joined The Monitor in 1921, spotlighted abuses of Wisconsin Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in a firm but non personal manner. The Monitor's approach set a high standard at a time many media were intimidated and fearful of being labeled pro-Communist.""*

Another reason the *Monitor* is held to a higher standard of journalism is its affiliation with a medium often associated with reliability - public radio. *MonitoRadio* was a program operated by the church that was carried by public stations from 1984 to 1997 in an attempt to broaden the paper’s horizons. Though what I’m about to cite is after this time period, a [2005 study](http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/survey-says-noncom-news-most-trusted/108687) found that public radio such as NPR was often regarded as the most trusted news source in the country; it would be safe to assume that the *Monitor* by affiliation would be seen as trustworthy.

AskHistorians,"What actually made knights obsolete? I've seen various explanations such as the creation of the crossbow, the invention of gunpowder, and the appearance of new infantry formations. Or did non-warfare related factors such as the end of feudalism also contribute to the decline of knights?","It wasn't the invention of gunpowder, but the much later development of improved guns. When this happened depends on what we mean by ""knight"". On the battlefield, the knight's role was that of armoured cavalry, or, when dismounted, armoured infantry. More generally, this military role was performed by *men-at-arms* (""armoured men""), rather than strictly by knight. Typically, knights were only a minority of the men-at-arms - often about 25% in English armies of the 13th and 14th centuries, and often below 10% in the 15th century and later.

The classic man-at-arms - an armoured lancer on an armoured horse - became obsolete in the 16th century. Increasing use of the pike, supported by the arquebus or musket, made the lance less effective against infantry. Enter the pistol: this restored the advantage of reach/range to the cavalryman, since the pistol could be used against infantry while staying out of the reach of the pike. As guns improved, the pistol became effective against armour, and became a more effective anti-armour weapon for the cavalryman than the lance (partly due to range, partly due to effectiveness against armour). These trends can be seen in various 16th century battles. For example, at Ceresole (1544), the lance performed poorly against infantry:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ekcozp/considering_how_effective_the_lance_was_at_the/

In the Battle of Coutras (1587), pistol-armed cavalry (supported by infantry with muskets) very quickly defeated a numerically superior force of armoured lancers (in part due to tactical errors by the lancers).

Pistols forced armour to be improved. This came at the cost of increased weight. While the cavalryman could be (partly) protected against pistol-shot (at least his torso and head), making the armour of the horse pistol-proof would have made it prohibitively heavy, and the armoured horse disappeared from the battlefield. Lances continued to be used, by armoured cavalry on unarmoured horses - the demi-lancer had replaced the fully-armoured lancer. At the same time, the pistol-armed cavalryman, initially usually a cuirassier with three-quarter armour (full armour down to the knees):

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pappenheim_Curassiers.PNG

but increasingly often with metal armour reduced to a breast and back (which might be worn over a buff coat) and helmet.

At this point, if we identify the ""knight"" (i.e., man-at-arms) as the fully-armoured lancer, the knight became obsolete in the late 16th century.

However, if we identify the ""knight"" as an armoured cavalryman, including those fighting on unarmoured horses, then the ""knight"" continued on as the demi-lancer and cuirassier (which is reasonable enough, considering that knights who still fought on the battlefield often served as demi-lancers and cuirassiers). In this case, the ""knight"" becomes obsolete in the mid-17th century, as further improvement in guns made the cuirassier no longer cost-effective. For example, the English Civil War (1642-1652) saw only two units of cuirassiers involved (Haselrig's Lobsters and the Lifeguard of the Earl of Essex, both Parliamentarian units). While their armour was still effective against pistols, the Lobsters took 70% losses in a single battle - unarmoured horses made them vulnerable even if pistol balls still bounced off breastplate and helmet.

Alternatively, if we are talking ""knights"" in the sense of the title rather than the military role of the armoured cavalryman, we could put the obsolescence of the knight at the end of the 14th century, when the fraction of men-at-arms who were knights fell to usually below 10%.

It's worth briefly considering the 3 military development you gave in your question:

* Crossbow: the crossbow drove improvements in armour (much as guns did soon after).

* Gunpowder: Crossbow-proof armour was also proof against early pistols, and even against early long guns. Thus, it took substantial improvement of guns for them to have much impact on the armoured cavalryman. In Europe, this meant that guns were used on the battlefield for more than 200 years before they pushed horse armour off the battlefield, and a total of more that 300 years before three-quarter armour was replaced by just a breastplate and helmet (or no armour). (In China, the gun and the armoured cavalryman coexisted for even longer, for more than 500 years.)

* New infantry formations: these certainly had an effect - namely that of helping drive the replacement of the lance by the pistol. This is, of course, tied to the previous point about guns. In the end, pike and musket armed infantry remained on the battlefield after the fully armoured cavalryman was gone (and would be replaced themselves by infantry armed with the combination of musket and bayonet).

Some examples of late three-quarter armour, all rather heavy to resist pistol-shot:

* 36kg: https://collections.royalarmouries.org/object/rac-object-1481.html

* 39kg: https://collections.royalarmouries.org/object/rac-object-16649.html

These weights also tell us why the fully-armoured infantryman disappeared earlier. This isn't weight that you want to run around a battlefield while wearing!"
AskHistorians,In what ways did Medieval France differ in culture and political structure from Medieval England?,I think you might like an older answer [here](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cv6qf9/what_were_the_ancient_liberties_that_the_magna/) dealing with feudal political culture in the High Medieval period
AskHistorians,"I grew up hearing about Anglo-Saxon migrations/conquests leaving an indelible mark on England. In recent decades, historians doubted the textual evidence for this and said any impact was small. Now, genetic testing shows a huge impact. Why did historians become doubtful, and why were they off base?","So this is fundamentally an argument about *historiography* or the study of how history is made.  And this question, and the genetic evidence that these articles muster, can be placed in the context of a broader discussion that has been raging in Early Medieval/Late Antiquity circles for decades.  

The best dissection of this debate that I've found is in Peter Heather's *Empires and Barbarians* where he looks at the different outcomes of the collapse of Roman rule across the former western Empire (and elsewhere) and he discusses the tensions between the two camps, largely that there was significant migration happening in the Late Antique/Early Medieval world, called ""mass migration"" and the camp that instead favors of model of migration that is termed ""elite replacement"", wherein a smaller number of people migrated, largely elites who replaced the Romano-British population as the primary political players, or in Heather's words

>Many historians and some archaeologists perceive the
evident Anglo-Saxonization of lowland Britain in the fifth and sixth
centuries to have been brought about through a hostile takeover,
which involved large numbers of migrants from northern Germany
and the Low Countries. A second group of opinion, on the other hand,
sees the process as having been effected by many fewer continental
European immigrants, whose cultural norms then spread broadly and
essentially voluntarily through the existing population: elite transfer
followed by cultural emulation. This is subscribed to by some historians but many more archaeologists, and is obviously heavily influenced
by the general rejection of the old mass-migration models inherent to
culture history.

The ""mass migration"" model dates back to the 19th century and has come under fire, but not as much from textual historians, who Heather notes have often landed into the ""mass migration"" field, but often from archaeologists.  Why did this happen?  What led the transition in the first place, why has it been discarded, and what do these genetic studies mean?

Let's break it all down.

Our story of the study of Anglo-Saxon England begins in a time long ago and a land faraway (for me).  However, it does not begin in England, or Britain if you prefer, in the 5th century.  Rather it begins in the United Kingdom in the 19th century.  

In the time of rapidly expanding factories, political turmoil, changing economic conditions, urbanization, and more, there were just as divisive and profound changes happening in the world of scholarship and academia.  The 19th century was a world that was waking up to many -isms.  Among these were socialism, feminism, capitalism, and above all, for our purposes, nationalism.  As the world changed and new systems, institutions, and movements developed, people across Europe sought for meaning in the changing world.  Some found solace in class struggle, placing their plight in a long continuum of the struggles of the haves and have nots, others in trying to bring about the vote to men, and women, of different races and creeds, but others, many others, looked backwards.  Not to the times of the Romans and Greeks, which had been all the rage of the early Modern Period thinkers and the Enlightenment philosophes.  It was not Rome, Athens, or Alexandria that most of the nationalist thinkers of Europe looked to, afterall many of the rising powers of Europe at this time, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, were subjugated by Rome, and while they admired Roman civilization, it was not properly *theirs*.  Their histories, their origins, their genesis lay in the neglected child of the western tradition, in the Middle Ages.  After all it was the fur clad barbarians who gave the countries of Europe their names.  Britainnia Superior and Inferior became England, Gaul became France, Iberia became Spain, and Italia, well it stayed Italy.  

The origin of the major powers of Europe were traced, by their scholars of the 19th century, to the time of *Voelkerwanderung* or the Migration Age, when whole societies uprooted from their ancestral homes in the primal forests of Germany and Scandinavia and carved out their new homes in Roman territory through a period bloody conquests that left newly formed nations in the wake of Rome's violent death.  The infant nations of modern Europe, Germany, England, France, and *the others* were left standing after the old Classical world burned away in a wave of fire and death. 

This is the account that came down to the Victorian, 19th, and early 20th century scholars, and it is not without a good deal of supporting evidence, limited as it is.  Textual sources from this time, roughly the 400's-800's are extremely rare, in fact there are about two (there is a third, the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, but they are extremely unreliable for this time period as most were compiled starting in the 9th century)

The first is a sermon delivered by a British (Welsh) ecclesiastical figure named Gildas.  In his work he describes the process by which Roman Britain, and the British people more broadly, have been laid low by their ungodliness and lack of faith.  Their punishment for these grave sins was the invasion of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes who were the agents of God's wrath upon the wretched and sinful inhabitants of the Island.  Only through religious renewal and continued support would the British polities survive and prosper in the face of Germanic attacks.  Simple as right?  He was roughly contemporary to the events he was describing, the 6th century(ish) and why shouldn't we trust him?  Its not like there were ulterior motives for a Church figure to associate the political and economic turmoil of Roman Britain with the wrath of God, right?  

His account, while hardly objective was influential enough to survive to be copied in medieval monastic communities where it found its way into the hands of an intelligent monk named Bede, from Jarrow.  He used that work, along with other lost works, and perhaps in person interviews, to compile his history of the English people and their conversion to Christianity, which he creatively titled *Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum* or the Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, and in this work he lays out the ground work of the ""mass migration"" school of though, basically that the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes all came over from Europe and did some looting and plundering, invited more of their kinsfolk, and ended up pushing out the British and created new kingdoms in the wake of British collapse.

This is the old view of mass migration that characterized the scholarship surrounding the Anglo-Saxon, and Frankish, and many other, migrations into Roman lands up until after the Second World War.  Starting in the 1960's though there was a fresh push in looking outside of the traditional sources of knowledge about this time period, and one that emphasized an entirely different source base, archaeology.

Instead of reading through old accounts and taking them at their word, or at least reflective of the real events, starting in the 1960's there were a series of archaeological discoveries that severely challenged the idea of a mass importation of Germanic people into Britain that pushed out the natives in a tide of blood.  Their evidence was varied but compelling, and it emphasized the material conditions of Britain."
AskHistorians,"Why didn’t the United States fall into chaos after the Revolution the same way as France, Russia and China did?","Building on what u/cornedbeefhash1 has discussed about the nature of the French, Russian, and Chinese Revolutions, I think it's also important to highlight the particulars of the American Revolution. 

&#x200B;

The American Revolution has been characterized by some as a 'Conservative Revolution'. While I have my gripes with this characterization as I believe it downplays the revolutionary experiment with federal republicanism, it's a good starting point for understanding what happens to lead to revolution in the first place. Essentially, the roots of the American Revolution lie in an irreconcilable dispute over the distribution of authority within a burgeoning British Empire. The original model of New World colonization adopted by most of the colonial empires understood the newly-established realms as co-equal titles to those of the monarch's European titles. In the Spanish Empire, for example, the Kingdoms of New Spain and New Grenada were legally equal titles to the Kingdom of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Italy, etc. that the Habsburg Spanish Monarchy asserted claims to at various points. That is not to say that the people within the colonial realms were treated as equal to people within the European realms, just that the titles themselves were considered no lesser to their European counterparts from a legalistic standpoint. This meant that for the Spanish Crown, the Council of the Indies (the political entity established to govern the New World Colonies) was in a co-equal position to the Council of Castile under the absolute\* sovereign authority of the King. This model of governance, where the various governing institutions of the different realms were legally considered co-equal under the absolute\* sovereign authority of the Monarch was the same model adopted by the British prior to 1763.

What is different in the case of the British Colonies was that the title under which the North American Colonies existed was less well defined than the Spanish ones. Under the Royal Charters, which established the various British Colonies in North America, the various settling groups were granted various authorities to create local institutions by the British Monarchy with the authority to govern on behalf of the sovereign in their respective colonies. 

As an example, in Virginia, the Virginia Company of London was granted three Charters in 1606, 1609, and 1612 respectively which granted the company the right to settle the territory which would become Virginia and to establish a governing council which, in 1619, was used to justify the creation of a Virginia Council of State (which later became the Virginia Governors Council within the broader Virginia General Assembly) in North America. Once the Virginia Company was dissolved and the colony was rechartered as a Crown Colony in 1624, following the Jamestown Massacre of 1622, the established Council would be integrated into all later charters as a legitimate governing body within Virginia. It would be joined by the Virginia House of Burgesses a few decades later in 1642 within the broader Virginia General Assembly which would act as a legitimate governing authority throughout the entire colonial period. What is critical here is that at no point as the institutions evolved were the Virginia Council of State, the Virginia Governors Council, the Virginia House of Burgesses, or the Virginia General Assembly ever legally considered subsidiary entities to the English Parliament in London."
AskHistorians,Why do we have 1 numerical system (Hindu-Arabic) worldwide but 100’s of languages? What caused this consolidation for numbers but not languages?,"Oh, I like this one

Alright, so, we'll revolve around two parts, first the advantages of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, then the history of mathematics and how they came to standardize Hindu-Arabic numerals

It's rather hard to say that a certain language is superior compared to others. [Research](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2594) has shown that when you compound the density of information with the speed of speech of languages, all languages tend to have the same rate of transmission of informations, which is 39bits per second. The only defining way of defining what would be an optimal language would depend on the tradeoff you're trying to strike between ease of learning (Esperanto for example) and precision, but since it's a tradeoff there is no absolute better language. There is no revolutionizing feature a single language has and that makes it superior to the other. Moreover, the fact that everyone learns language from their environment also limits widespread efforts of language uniformization - as seen, for example, under the attempts of the French 3rd Republic of eradicating local french dialects.

On the other hand, there are ways of counting that are superior to others - especially the ones that have what we call positional notation. What does it mean? It means when we use numbers, the contribution of a digit to the value is the value of the digit multiplied by a factor determined by the position of the digit. This factor is called the base of the system. In arabic numerals we use base 10 but there are many bases in positionnal number systems - base 2 (binary), base 8 (octal), base 10(decimal) , base 12(duodecimal) , base 16 (hexadecimal), base 60(babylonian)...

What it means is, for example, in base 10, 42 is 4x10^1 + 2x10^0. In base 2, 10 is 1x2^1 + 0x2^0=2.

So why are arabic numerals superior? There are several advantages. 

-Positional notation allows for easy representations of arbitrarily large numbers

-The idea of positional fractions come rather easily, as, say, 4.2 = 4x10^0 + 2x10^(-1) - some traces of it were found as far back as the Xth century. So, easier to express non interger values 

-It's much easier to use to calculate stuff. For addition, substraction and multiplication, you just align the numbers, do your individual operations, put them in the right position and you're done. Think about how hard it would be to calculate, for example, 48x11 (equals 48 times 10 plus 48, equals 528)... But it's actually XXXXVIII times XI. (quick parentheses - there is no evidence to suggest the current interpretation of roman numerals that ""a symbol before a higher value symbol is a substraction"" - as in ""IV = 5-1=4"" was ever used historically - the roman numeric system is already complicated enough as is to not further complicate it with perfectly avoidable subtractions. So XXXXVIII rather than XLVIII) 

 Even knowing that X times X = C, X times V = L, that makes CCCC + L + XXX + XXXXVIII = CCCC + L + L + XXVIII = CCCCC + XXVIII = DXXVIII. It's much lenghtier because one you have multiplied the numbers you need to squash them together to recover the expression using the least amount of symbols. What about divisions? The answer is... We don't know. The most comprehensive source we have on the topic is Friedlein (1869) and he hypothesizes that romans used abaci (plural of abacus) to compute division. Unfortunately, unlike the Greeks, Romans were not really interested in writing down theoretical mathematics, so we have no idea of how they calculated really - the aforementioned example is just me using the most efficient possible way, but they may have just used repeated additions, or the much more efficient powers of 10 methods - which the Greeks knew. We simply don't know. 

-Arabic numerals have this small dot that is called __sifr__ which is the root for the french ""chiffre"" (digit) and the english ""cipher"" : the zero. The influence of the idea of zero on the entire field of mathematics cannot be overstated and would deserve its own post. Let's just say that you cannot build an advanced theory of mathematics without the 0 (it has been independently invented no less than 3 times), and roman numerals do not have a zero. 

-As a freebie : it's much easier to check calculations made with arabic numerals rather than roman numerals. In roman numerals in most cases the only way to check a calculation is to redo it entirely. In arabic numerals it's not necessary. That is a huge advantage. 

>Thanks to the use of figures and fractions, Arabic mathematics allowed to handle rational numbers with an efficiency that could not be matched by the previous Roman system. The fundamental financial instrument of the period – the bill of exchange – could not have been developed in the absence of Hindu-Arabic numerals, as it was based on a proportion between fractions.  (source below) 


So in a few words, roman numerals were unwieldy and generally not terribly great at doing what numbers do. Gauss once lamented on the fact that Archimedes had imagined a positional numeric system but failed to realize the importance of his discovery. Gauss said that if Archimedes had pushed with his system, mathematics would have earned centuries worth of progress. 

As for why the positional babylonian numerals weren't adopted, base 60 (59 symbols) made them hard to use for non specialist. It is today generally agreed upon that the superior base is 12 as it minimizes the amount of non simplifiable fractions while retaining easy readability. In any case, we're stuck with base 10.

AskHistorians,"What happened to 'British' breads? Or, what caused the dominance of French and Italian bread in Anglo-Saxon, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish diets?","I suggest you ask yourself, are supermarkets the best places to be looking for British vernacular baking? And to what extent does the presence of French and Italian bread styles in supermarkets represent their role in daily diets?

Fashion dictates what is sold in supermarkets. French food has been a class signifier in British culture for centuries. French and (to a lesser extent) Italian cooks have been hired in elite British households and restaurants for hundreds of years. The presence of French and Italian breads in supermarkets is in line with the tendency of high-status products to become more widely sought after, with manufacturers happy to monetize public desires. 

British traditional baking tends to be highly regional; many breads are associated with local identities and agricultural products. An example of this would be the Cornish saffron bun, which reflects Cornwall’s history of saffron production.

Many traditional bakes are also relatively small. Bannocks, baps, Cornish splits, bara brith, barm brack, pikelets, and Lady Arundel manchets are all examples of British breads that don’t fit the sandwich-loaf model.

Visit local bakeries that promote traditional specialties and you’ll find much more varied and British styles of baking.

AskHistorians,Why wasn't China more imperialist at the height of their power?,"But... it *was*. It's easy to presume that 'China' was a continuous state that has always occupied the territory it does, but Chinese empires, like any other, rose and fell, though rarely without some permanent addition to what we might consider the contiguous core territory of 'China', however defined. I have a number of past answers that go into the imperial ambitions of the Qing Empire alone:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ro7m0d/did_china_have_the_naval_and_navigation/hpwt2yc/

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ncpdv2/why_did_china_never_build_a_colonial_empire/gy8kese/

But we can look at the broader sweep of Chinese history and see that the notion that China was never an imperial power is patently false. Take a look, for instance, at a [map of the post-Zhou states ca. 450 BCE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Early_Warring_States_Period.png), and compare it to [a map of the Han Empire at its peak around 2 CE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Han_Civilisation.png), and you will find that the intervening years had seen enormous expansion of Han Chinese settlement both southwards and eastwards. And even then, Chinese settlement in the south was patchy. For the past two millennia, the Han Chinese and their ancestors have continually been taking over indigenous land in what is now south China, a deeply violent process of displacement, absorption, and eradication. The territorial consolidation of 'China proper' was still incomplete by the time of the Ming: even [this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Ming_foreign_relations_1580.jpg) elides the extent to which large portions of the south, particularly in Guizhou and to a lesser extent Yunnan, were nominally-autonomous, functionally-independent regions where indigenous polities retained sovereignty. The Qing, of course, would expand even further afield, as noted in the above-linked answers, and as illustrated by [this map of the Qing empire's peak ca. 1820.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Qing_China_1820.png)

So I just have to reject the premises of the question. Chinese empires absolutely were imperialist. The reason we tend not to notice, is that modern China has managed to *keep its empire*. So far."
AskHistorians,How did dad jokes help the Thirteen Colonies in their struggle for independence?,"Dad jokes in the late 1770s were primarily a source of entertainment and morale among the soldiers, a way for the one who made the joke to feel a brief moment of happiness instead of feeling his toes fall off from frostbite at Valley Forge. 

They were eventually used as something of a shibboleth or password, where those born and raised in the colonies would have different responses to particular common dad joke setups, allowing scouts and guards to quickly determine whether someone unknown was friend or foe. Notably in one of George Washington's 1779 letters to Congress he details how an English spy was caught due to failing one such dad joke:

> *On approach, our scout gave challenge, as is proper; the assailant gave his name as Joe, as is the custom. Yet on the follow-up probe ""Joe who?"" the man replied ""Joe Smith"".

AskHistorians,"How did a project as insane as the CIA's human experimentation in MK-Ultra ""brain warfare"" managed to be approved and conducted for 20 years?","During the Korean War, there were many reports that the North Koreans were practicing what was dubbed ""brain-washing"" on captured prisoners of war. The notion was that through careful forms of psychological torture and manipulation, they could actually cause hardened GIs to not just say what they wanted them to say, but really believe it. Think _The Manchurian Candidate_, which came out around this time. Now, the reality of things was a bit more complicated — they were torturing American POWs, but whether it went much further than that, isn't clear — but the _idea_ of the mind as a frontier for warfare took hold with several branches of the US national security state, including the CIA.

You can think of MK-ULTRA as emerging out of two ideas. One is how to avoid or undo ""brain-washing."" The other was, could we do something like that ourselves? When you put it this way, it doesn't sound ""insane"" — it is an extension into psychology of the same Cold War mindset that one finds everywhere else then, and still today in some circles. The historian Paul Edwards used the term ""The Closed World"" to talk about the idealized Cold War mentality, which was a scientifically-precise, technically-enabled control. His book of the same name is about the history of computing (computers were an important technical means and metaphor for that control), but you can apply the idea to lots of areas, including psychology. If this all sounds ""crazy,"" consider that the most dominant theory of psychology during this period was Behaviorism, which under B.F. Skinner was imagined to grant you as much total control over humans as you could get over pigeons, and included a radical denial not only of free will but pretty much consciousness itself. (I am not blaming the CIA for Behaviorism, just pointing out that these ideals fit together like a hand in glove.) 

Anyway, I don't see the whole thing as insane. Bad science? Sure. Unethical? Oh, yeah. Inappropriate? Arguably! Insane? The mind is a mysterious thing, and seeing it as a battleground of the Cold War was easily imaginable because the totalizing nature of how Americans in the Cold War national security state conceived of _everywhere_ as being the battleground. So why not the mind?

There are far weirder things that the US and Soviets pursued in this period for the same reasons. E.g., experiments with ESP and ""Remote Viewing."" They threw a lot of money at things to see what ""stuck."" A few things did in a big way. A lot of things didn't. $80 million is not that much money for the Cold War. Consider that over the course of the Cold War the US spent around $3 _trillion_ USD on the nuclear arsenal, and that for a good chunk of the Cold War the US had weapons that, if you summed up the entire stockpile, had the power well over a million times the Hiroshima bomb. To me that is much ""crazier"" than investing a little money to see if a powerful hallucinogen had application as a ""truth serum.""

There's more that can be said. I personally enjoy assigning the chapter ""The Impossible Experiment"" from Rebecca Lemov's _World as Laboratory: Experiments with Mice, Mazes, and Men_, which goes over a lot of the MK-ULTRA origins and goals in context, along with the complex funding mechanisms they used to avoid even the researchers necessarily knowing who was giving them money."
AskHistorians,"On Feb 23, 1981, there was a fascist coup d'etat attempt in Spain that was condemned by most of NATO, except for the US. Given the rise in popularity of the Spanish Communist Party at the time, was Reagan's staunch anticommunism what led his administration to refuse to condemn the failed coup?","This was more Haig (Secretary of State under Reagan) putting his foot in his mouth as opposed to any general policy.

First off, for the benefit of those unaware: after the death of Franco in 1975, Spain transitioned to sort of an uneasy democracy under the rule of King Juan Carlos. Uneasy because  the votes originally went quite right wing (for mayors, judges, etc.), but also because of a failed coup in 1978, Operation Galaxia. This coup is so named after a group of pro-Franco military members who hatched a plan to kidnap the cabinet, but this was foiled by an alert from government intelligence and the plotters were left off with a light sentence. 

One of the plotters, Colonel Antonio Tejero, made a more serious attempt on February 23, 1981, bringing a group of soldiers to Parliament and holding members of the government hostage. However, the coup fizzled out as no other military groups converged to join ranks and King Carlos disavowing the plot on live television:

>The crown, symbol of the permanence and unity of the nation, cannot tolerate, in any form, actions or attitudes attempting to interrupt the democratic process.

On the morning of the coup, while he was in a meeting with the French foreign minister Jean François-Poncet, Haig was asked about it by a reporter; according to Haig in a press conference later:

>We knew nothing of the situation, and I made the off-hand comment that this is an internal matter, and clearly indicated we had to find out what it was all about before any judgment or any comment would be made.

The part about ""an internal matter"" was the part that got picked up by _The New York Times_ and especially by the Spanish media, with _Cambio 16_ reporting ""Reagan Washed His Hands"". This started the rumor (which I'll get back to) that the Reagan administration knew about the coup beforehand.

The official position of the Reagan administration (as opposed to the offhand Haig comment) was read by a representative February 24:

>We note that the challenge to Spanish democracy was limited to a small number of people. The overwhelming majority of the armed forces and the Spanish people remain loyal to the King and the Constitution ... The role and the leadership of King Juan Carlos were clearly instrumental in ending the crisis and are deserving of particular admiration. The President called the King this morning at 10:35, Washington time.

Despite some conspiracy theories after, the coup would completely have ruined the chances for the United States's keenest wish: that Spain would join NATO.

Spain under Franco and the United States had signed a defense treaty in 1953, with the US providing weapons and support; the US was particularly interested in Spain as a bulwark due to their control of the Straits of Gibraltar. This was a continuation of the perception amongst rightists in the United States during the Spanish Civil War that Franco was serving as a counterbalance to the ""godless communists"".

The so-called Pact of Madrid eventually led to an enormous amount of military aid flowing to Spain in exchange for the ability to build military bases (including Naval Station Rota, which had nuclear submarines during the hottest time of the Cold War). Post the death of Franco and the Political Reform Law of '76, the treaties still held. It was no longer the case the Pentagon could just dictate terms like in the Franco era, but the work had been put in already by the coup (for example, the naval base with the nuclear subs had the last nuclear sub removed in 1979; it was always a local point of contention the area was a potential target for Soviet missiles).

Curiously, one of the obstacles in the way of NATO membership was the existing US alliance itself; some of the left-leaning parties, still treating NATO with suspicion, preferred renewing the accord with additional provisions for mutual defense (e.g. have the US intervene if Morocco attacked Melilla, an autonomous Spanish city in Africa).

Despite this slant, the US position was to make consider any new treaty to essentially be a temporary stepping stone to NATO membership, which was, in fact, eventually approved: the Parliament voted in favor in October of 1981, and in May of 1982 Spain officially became the 16th member of NATO.

Now I need to loop back to the gigantic elephant still in the room: did the US know about the coup attempt beforehand? This is one of the long-standing conspiracy theories in Spain, one that has had the same sort of intensity of attention as the JFK assassination. The main source: the coup plotters themselves testified that they knew.

This appears that it might have actually been somewhat the case; [the King was warned ahead of time](https://www.revistavanityfair.es/poder/articulos/tejero-connection-el-23-f-y-el-papel-de-eeuu/11323). Specifically, he mentioned to a journalist in August that he had got a warning from American intelligence ""two months earlier"" and was annoyed that Spanish intelligence had let it pass when the King asked for it to be looked into.

However, note this was a vague warning -- in other words, the US did not have exact enough information to be knowledgeable about the exact date of February 23. No documents have turned up from the US side to support any further detail than this. I'm most skeptical because, again: while democracy meant the chance of the appearance of leftists, a slide back to fascism would have killed the NATO membership dead, and in fact the application was endangered by the coup; Madrid had to make the argument after that NATO membership would be a _safeguard_ for keeping democracy. The US knew this quite well, as it had already proposed membership for Spain back in 1975 at a NATO meeting; the suggestion was dead-on-arrival for the members as long as Spain did not have a democratic system.

In truth, the US cared most about countries being a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and was pragmatic about their level of communism. After Tito and Stalin famously had their split, Yugoslavia, while still quite communist, started receiving significant amounts of aid starting with Truman; while ideology could sometimes affect policy, the desire for a strong defensive position against the Soviets trumped all other things. In the case of Spain, with four military bases already, falling to the Soviets due to ideology was not a concern, and the Spanish were reliant enough on the US for defensive assistance that while there was pushback and compromise, the US military was going to stay.

AskHistorians,"Czechoslovakia peacefully divided into Slovakia and the Czech Republic in 1993. In the years/months leading up to this moment, how exactly do political tensions get so high that people want to secede and become a separate country, but not enough to cause a civil war?","As someone who was born there, it is not really easy to outline all the issues and problems that led to the disintegration of Czechoslovakia. Various historians and political analysts will not even agree when the state fractured. Some will claim that it was the election of 1992, others would point to 1989, 1968, 1960, 1948, 1947, 1945, 1939, or even to the foundation of the republic in 1918. Until now, there is not extensive study and I am not sure if the nostalgia for Czechoslovakia relates to the common state or rather the apathy of inert, Soviet occupied Czechoslovakia of the 1970s and 80s, where masses ceded the control of the country in the exchange for a minimal basic economic security.     

The bigger problem with the common state lies with the outline of idea of Czechslovakism that arose during the foundation of the republic. Media Sme once outlined the problem with Czechoslovakia as such that Czechs asked Slovaks to join without asking what they wanted in return and without caring what such union would require. Slovaks were not considered what Czechs expect from Slovaks in nation-building. It was an obscure image of one nation with two branches without defining what it means. There was not such thing as the Czechoslovak language. Slovaks immediately rejected this, always claiming that their language was independent of that of Czech. It was always state with two languages. This language, cultural and economic differences were a main source of instability throughout the entire existence of the common state. The state disintegrated in 1939.  

After the war, the state was patched but the Slovak autonomy was not addressed. At the peak of the Red Terror, communists prosecuted and even executed perceived Slovak nationalists. The suspension of the Slovak self-governance in 1960 could be seen as another step that puts both nations apart. This caused the fall of Novotny in 1968 and ushered a brief liberalization until to be crushed by the Soviet tanks. The federalization of the state was a first physical division of Czechoslovakia and within the next 20 years, both nations grew apart.  

Czechoslovakia between 1969-1989 was a Slovak managed federation. Brezhnev distrusted Czechs due Novotny and Prague Spring and bestowed the presidency, party leadership, the military, and the foreign affairs to Slovaks. In exchange, Slovakia experienced less restrictions, minimal purges, and much higher economic growth. Czechs got nothing in return; its universities, media, publishing, civic organization, military, and administration was purged out anti-Soviet elements. The economy was getting from bad to worse. Czechoslovakia by 1980s was country with two distinct societies. It was visible in the social and demographic snapshot. There was not such thing as one daily newspaper that would circulate throughout the federation. When the communist regime fell, the bond with the state weakened.  

After the Velvet Revolution, both societies clearly diverged on aspirations. The Czechs were unhappy how the country deteriorated between 1968-1989, while Slovaks wanted nothing to do with the unitary republic governed prior 1968. Both nations disagreed on the political makeup. Due Czechs having a much larger population, their voting block was driving the changes in 1990-1992. The primary mover was Prague and its political elites that had a clear vision on transformation from the communist system to modern. The Slovak elites were always one step behind and did not participate effectively with the rapid speed of changes. There were many issues ranging from the liberalization of the economy to the establishment of the Constitutional courts and Slovak participation shrunk into national symbols and more autonomy. The political leadership in Slovakia was extremely amateurish in comparison to the Czech one with Havel in the lead.   

The years from 1990-1992 were mired in numerous problems, shrinking economy, and never ending demands from Slovakia for more autonomy. Slovaks wanted loser confederation but maintaining common currency. This was unacceptable to the Czechs. It was actually the Czech side under Vaclav Klaus that came from 1992 election that requested the end of the common state. Slovaks were not prepared for it. However, protests in Slovakia for more autonomy where widespread, I seen a few of them in Bratislava and by the summer of 1992, the talk of secession was more prevalent.   

In 1992 came the total disintegration of the federal structures. Havel resigned. Facilities, factories, and organization across the federation withdrew shipments and channel distributions, and banks limited the financial flows. Slovak economy was not delivering taxes to the central bank (it was a main problem in 1993 the Czech budget to fund this gap) while the federal subsidies ended. Everything happened within six months. The country voted out from existence and new states formed.   

The big role in the collapse was played by the media. Since the director of the federal TV explicitly banned informing the Czech public about the situation in Slovakia, the population there was not aware of the tension. It is documented in the book ‘What cameras have not seen’ and many of us who traveled to Slovakia regularly in 1991-92 were displeased with the lack of coverage on the Czech TVs. The federal system shrunk into two entities. The Czech media and society was more concerned with the transformation while totally ignoring the Slovak economic crisis and frustration. The economic crisis in Slovakia was more dire, the social system was strained. This fueled more independent movement prior 1992."

AskHistorians,why did Rome destroy Carthage?,"First: To analyze the question, ""Why did Rome go to war,"" we need to assess our ideological assumptions about state actions.

One theory of international relations is that states are unitary, rational actors. In this view, ""Rome"" is a singular entity attempting to maximize its national interest. ""It"" makes the decision to use warfare to obtain for itself some gain; for example, the elimination of a commercial or military rival. States, through their leaders, make calculated gambles, assessing the risk/reward of going to war.

Another theory is that states are not unitary actors; they contain many different actors with conflicting goals and interests. For example: It's true that Cato was constantly proclaiming that Rome needed to lay waste to Carthage. But Cato was just one guy. Other Romans disagreed with Cato. And (very importantly): Even if other Romans agreed with Cato, they may have agreed for different reasons. So if one Roman consul wants to destroy Carthage for one reason, and another Roman consul wants to destroy it for another reason, and some senators want to destroy it for another reason, and so on.

According to this latter theory, there is often not a singular reason why a state does something; state actions are often the result of cacophonous, discordant internal disagreements and political disputes, or at least consensus decisions arrived at for a variety of potentially diverse reasons.

Second: We should differentiate between a stated reason for war and the actual reasons for war.

Polybius himself, the ancient historian who lived through and wrote about the Third Punic War in his *Histories*, differentiated between the pretext for going to war and the actual causes of a war. In Book 36 of his histories, he writes that ""\[the idea of going to war with Carthage"" having been firmly fixed in the minds of all, \[the Romans\] looked out for a suitable opportunity and a decent pretext to justify them in the eyes of the world. For indeed the Romans were quite rightly very careful on this point. For instance, the general impression that they were justified in entering upon the war with Demetrius enhances the value of their victories, and diminishes the risks incurred by their defeats; but if the pretext for doing so is lame and poor the contrary effects are produced."" Unfortunately, the surviving text does not contain the pretext. Appian, another historian, writes about this too (but he may just be cribbing from Polybius).

It *does* seem like the Carthaginian-Numidian War was at least part of the pretext for the Roman invasion. Basically, in 201 BC, Rome declared, ""Carthage, you aren't allowed to wage war without our permission."" So Carthage's neighbor, Numidia and its Roman-allied king Massinia, saw this as an opportunity to invade and start gobbling up Carthaginian territory. Carthage defends itself, and Rome says, ""Hey! You aren't allowed to wage war, Carthage! As punishment, we are invading."" This is how Baronowski (writing in 1995, so I'm not sure if there's better or more recent scholarship) reads Polybius and Appian. Baronowski notes that some ancient historians (Livy and Dio) sees the Carthaginian-Numidian conflict as the *cause*, and not the *pretext*, for the Third Punic War. Personally, I find the pretext-interpretation more convincing.

Third: Let's finally get to the actual causes discussion. Ursula Vogel-Weidemann summarizes a variety of hypotheses in a 1989 article reviewing the scholarship:

* Rome honestly (if irrationally) feared Carthage as a threat to its existence and security;
* Rome wanted to seize Carthage's wealth and resources (but some scholars disagree, arguing this is an anachronistic and modern frame of reference, pointing out that ancient sources are silent on this, and noting that Romans made no attempt to colonize Carthage or ""exploit its commercial facilities);
* Rome wanted to destroy Carthage so its neighbors, the Numidians, would not gobble it up, become stronger, and then themselves pose a threat to Roman security (but, again, this appear to be a minority hypothesis not accepted by many scholars);
* Roman politicians conjured up an external Carthaginian villain to maintain internal stability (e.g. unite domestic forces against external forces), and the natural progression of this position is that the villain must be destroyed;
* The push to destroy Carthage was a manifestation of a violent, ""mailed-fist"" approach to Roman imperialistic foreign policy, with this flashpoint being the final step along this cultural and ideological development: ""the application of brute force and the destruction of not only a declared enemy, but also of a potential adversary"" (a much more modern example is the possibly apocryphal statement of neoconservative American historian Michael Ledeen, who is alleged to have said, in the 1990s, words to the effect of, ""Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business,"" a statement which many have connected to build-up to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan).

All of this is to say: It's a hard question to answer. Personally, I think the best answer is: ""A coalition of Romans genuinely believed Carthage was a possible threat to their security and also generally bought-in to a theory of foreign policy prioritizing brute force and domination of all adversaries, whether real, imagined, or potential. And it didn't hurt that it was occasionally politically expedient to establish Carthage as a boogeyman from which Romans needed to be protected."" If I can editorialize a little bit: Historically, empires tend to be paranoid. They see threats all around them. They have a hammer (their legions, their armies, their navies) and they see the surrounding tribes, chiefdoms, kingdoms, and lesser empires as nails.

One final note: Literally any time you see enormous numbers for ancient events in military histories (e.g. size of armies, number of casualties, etc.), you should immediately be skeptical because (1) we are often guessing and do not have hard, reliable evidence on those figures and (2) ancient historians are notoriously unreliable when they report those figures (e.g. a Roman-friendly historian reporting a Roman victory may deflate Roman casualties and inflate opposing force casualties for political reasons). So I don't know if that 450,000 number is reliable. It might be. But I am always immediately skeptical of the reliability of such numbers.

AskHistorians,Could the Bennets in Pride and Prejudice have broken the entail by adopting a son?,"I have a previous answer that lays out some necessary background: [Understanding inheritance in the early 1800's](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fudn7h/understanding_inheritance_in_the_early_1800s/fmck94c/). The relevant tl;dr:

* An entail in this period was part of a contract made by each father and son in the family line, in which the son would accept a life interest in the estate in exchange for an income.

* This contract and/or the marriage contract would lay out every potential child's inheritance.

* The entail could not be broken without the consent of the heir, typically the next son.

Adoption existed before there was a legal process for it. Jane Austen's brother Edward was adopted by childless relatives, Thomas and Catherine Knight! However, what that meant was that they took him to live with them and simply changed Thomas's will to leave the majority of his lands to Edward (at which point Edward changed his last name to ""Austen Knight""); it didn't mean that Edward was legally their son. Thomas presumably did not have an estate that was settled on an entail, which is why he was able to do this in the first place. If the Bennets had taken in a young male relative to be their son, he would not have been able to inherit Longbourn.

>Would adoption displace the sisters in inheritance, as he’d be the only boy?

The sisters really *have* no place in the inheritance (which is the point of the situation in the book). Their inheritances are laid out in the contract and unchangeable (except, as pointed out in the earlier answer, in that Mr. Bennet could have saved money from his own income to add to them - but they can't get smaller). A son would have allowed for *Mr. Collins* to be displaced in the inheritance, not the daughters. Then he could supplement their dowries/inheritances if he chose in order to make them more marriageable.

I also have a Medium post, [What's In An Entail?](https://medium.com/@mimicofmodes/whats-in-an-entail-c78614918d75), that explains the issue at length and in the context of Austen's novels."
AskHistorians,"CW: the wikipedia page for schizophrenia’s predecessor diagnosis, “dementia praecox,” displays a horrifying image of a woman in a French asylum with her diagnosis literally scratched into her back. Was this a practice??","The woman on the picture, in addition to her severe mental issues (more on that later), suffers from a skin condition called [dermographism, or dermographic urticaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatographic_urticaria), a type of urticaria caused by scratching or simple pressure that creates temporary wheals, which can take the shape of writing or drawing. It is not necessary to damage the skin: the tip of a pen or of a fingernail, and sometimes the pressure of the palm can be enough.

This condition was first alluded to by Dr Robert Willan in *On cutaneous diseases* (1808), where he describes a condition where patches appear ""on any part of the skin by strong friction or scratching"". 

A full description of the condition appeared in 1859 by William Gull, from Guy's Hospital, who [included a picture](https://books.google.fr/books?id=t38QAQAAMAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&dq=%22on%20factitious%20urticaria%22&pg=PA318-IA1#v=onepage&q=%22on%20factitious%20urticaria%22&f=false) where he wrote the initials of the patient. 

>Any form of wheal in these cases could be determined by the direction and extent of friction on the skin, and if with a blunt point any figure or letter was traced it quickly came into relief with great sharpness of outline. In the accompanying Plate is shown the forearm of a young gentleman, where the initials of his name thus traced have so risen. The effect is greatest where the skin is well supplied with muscular fibre-cells, and hence on the volar surface of the thumb it is scarcely produced. This susceptibility of the skin is common, in a greater or less degree, to all persons, and can be termed morbid only when extreme. In the first patient in whom I noticed it, it was the source of great inconvenience, for if the skin was handled roughly, as in wiping the face with a towel or in pulling on the socks, it would quickly become swollen and stiff with wheals. This susceptibility may be hereditary. It was so in the case of the gentleman who afforded his arm for the sketch. His father's skin was equally irritable. In four other cases which I have seen, this tendency in the skin came on gradually, without any assignable cause. In one only was there any recognisable disturbance of the general health, and that was in a youth of fifteen, who was liable to attacks of spasmodic asthma, which seemed to be associated with the state of the skin.

This was the first of the many pictures of dermographism that would be taken by doctors in the following decades.

While the condition has been observed in all types of patients (sex, age etc.), it became associated with ""nervous"" people and particulary with female hysteria, notably in France, where doctors became quite interested in the question. 

One seminal paper of the subject was that of Georges Dujardin-Beaumetz, *Note sur des troubles vaso-moteurs de la peau observés sur une hystérique (femme autographique)*, 1879. The patient, 29-year-old Julie Jagoret, had been suffering from various ""nervous accidents"" since she was 9, and she had been in and out of the Hopital Saint-Antoine for a couple of years. 

Two symptoms drew the attention of Dujardin-Beaumetz. One was her loss of skin sensitivity: the skin of her limbs, stomach, breasts, and face could be pierced through without her feeling any pain. The other was her strange urticaria:

>When one draws a line on the external tegument with the fingernail or with a blunt instrument (*pointe mousse*), a red streak appears after a few seconds, then this redness spreads and forms a rectangular patch; finally, after two to five minutes, a white projection appears throughout the area of the line drawn on the skin, the relief of which becomes more and more pronounced until it reaches a millimetre and a half to two millimetres thick. Things remain as they are for three to six hours, sometimes even for twelve hours, and then everything disappears. The experiment can be varied in a thousand ways, the most diverse drawings can be made on the skin, names of ten to fifteen letters can be written, wherever the blunt instrument has pressed, there is a white relief, and all around it, in an area of four to five centimetres, a red plate. At the level of this plate, there is constantly a noticeable rise in temperature which can be easily appreciated by hand. When the phenomenon has reached its full development, when the plate and the reliefs are well constituted, the portion of the skin which is the seat of it resembles quite well a printing plate; hence the name of cliché woman, autographic woman, by which she has been known since her entry into the department.

And so was born the ""autographic woman""! 

This was followed by a flurry of clinical observations in the last decades of the century, with doctors trying to link dermographism - which remained mysterious and spectacular - with other conditions, including hysteria. It is probable that the association of dermographism to hysteria predates its ""discovery"" of 1879: in the *Dermatose* entry of the *Dictionnaire encyclopédique des sciences médicales* (1883), Dr J. Renaut describes briefly the condition in hysterical women and how easy it was to 

>scratch the skin with your fingernail or with the tip of a pencil to form a design or letters. [...] I repeated this experience many times with my master Lorain, who liked to stigmatise hysterics in this way.

Féré and Lamy, in their review of the dermographic cases published in 1889, claimed that they had observed it in 46 ""epileptic or nervous"" people out of 130, and that it was primarily seen in ""hysterical women"" and people suffering from urticaria. They reported various attempts at replicating it by other means, such as needles, water jet, cold, and [electricity](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6354314m/f8.item), as well as attempts at preventing it (ether...). But the phenomenon remained mysterious, and all that remained eventually were photographs of the backs and limbs of the patients - women but also men - showing the ""writings"" of the doctors. In his philosophical analysis of the medical study of dermographism in late 19th France, Georges Didi-Huberman mentions that doctors wrote the names of the patients, or their condition, or sometimes signed with their own names, as if the patients were paintings (Didi-Huberman, 1990).

A entire book on the topic was written by Dr Barthémy in 1893, which features several pictures including two of women with [SATAN](https://books.google.fr/books?id=HQHMmgEACAAJ&pg=PA38-IA2#v=onepage&q&f=false) written in their backs. One woman is described as ""high status, active, intelligent, refined, nervous, a true sensitive"", while the other is ""lower class, apathetic, overworked, depressed, of obtuse and narrow-minded intellect"". Barthélemy also wrote SATAN on a horse, while another doctor wrote BAR and drew a devil's head on the animal. In the second part of the book, Barthélémy links dermographism with religious stigmata and ancient accusations of witchcraft - which probably explains why he wrote SATAN in his experiments. He also provides descriptions for about 70 cases of dermographism.

The patient shown in the Wikipedia article was called Eugénie G., 27. Her case was described in detail by Dr. L. Trepsat, a doctor at the lunatic asylum of Evreux (Trepsat, 1904). Eugénie had been born in a lunatic asylum herself, where her mother had been a long time patient until her death. She was a seamstress living with her father, and she suffered from serious psychiatric disorders (hallucinations, catatonia, paranoia etc.), as well as skin disorders - purpura and dermographism. Trepsat:

>9 June 1903. We traced some characters on the skin with a blunt tip: immediately at the level of the compressed points, there was an oedema, anaemic, producing a prominent bulge, perceptible to the touch and to the sight. To the right and left of these raised white lines, a zone of bright red congestion appears. Half an hour after drawing the characters, the congestion had diminished a little in intensity, but the anaemic oedema persisted. 

>11 June. By rubbing the skin lightly in the region where we had written: ""Dementia praecox"" 48 hours before, we saw some of the letters (white lines surrounded by a congestive cloud) appear quite clearly, mainly the end of the two words: NCE and OCE situated in the right half of the thorax.

The same day, Trespat interviewed Eugénie, collected her answers, and then asked her to put her thoughts in writing, resulting in the following text.

>Miss Eugénie Gr, leaving my father, Mr. Prosper Gr. Montfort l'Amaury Seine-et-Oise Seine-et-Oise Miss Eugénie Gr... leaving my father Mr. Prosper Gr. Montfort l'Amaury Seine-el-Oise not stay in a health house Evreux Eure not stay in a insane asylum Evreux Eure France France Independence no health house or insane asylum France bread torture with soup hurts coffee hurts Torture with coffee hurts giving moral suffering drowned people drowned world by voyage beyond the seas by going to seek plant or commercial relation exchange soup hurts torture moral bodily suffering not vegetables inside moral impurity hallucinations. Bread only food not stay leave Miss Eugénie Gr.

So: French doctors at the end of the 19th century were fascinated by a skin condition called dermographism, that they tried to associate to female hysteria, but that they could not really understand. For years, they studied patients suffering from dermographism and wrote things on their bodies, took pictures of their artwork, and wrote reports describing how the symptoms appeared, their intensity, colour, duration etc. Doctors may have written or drawn things for fun - the French medical community [has a long history of rowdiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pqu0uu/how_long_has_69_been_the_funny_sex_number/hdgjjxc/) - or they sometimes only drew lines, or they wrote the name of the patient's condition, as in the case of Eugénie G.

AskHistorians,Are there any diaries of prostitutes from the Wild West?,"“Pioneering the Yukon” by Anna DeGraf is a memoir of a prostitute (edit: she was a seamstress, not a prostitute.

Although not a diary, there should also be court records of May Aiken, also of Circle City, Rose Arnold and Ruth Brown, of Skagway, all black working women from the same time period.

I realize that both these examples are not exactly from the Wild West per sé, but you can draw parallels between the Wild West and the ‘wild frontier’ in which these women worked and lived.

AskHistorians,"In the 1941 children's book Curious George, George prank-calls the Fire Department, which is able to locate his signal on a map of the city, and which sends firemen to his location. Would this have been possible? Would children have understood this concept?","That would be science fiction as far as I know. At that time, depending on the area calls would have been routed either by automatic mechanical relays or operators. In this case, rotary dialing means they'd be using pulse dialed mechanical relays. The rotary phone sends pulses that set the position of relays (electromagnetic switches) at the telephone routing office - these relays ultimately physically connect your telephone's circuit to the receiving telephone circuit. The relays of that time were pretty big, and their position could be seen with the naked eye. 

There's a neat video of some relays here: https://www.efootage.com/videos/29513/1940s-telephone-and-relay-station .

As such, a human tracing a call inside the telephone routing office could look at the physical position of the relays to determine where a call was coming from. This was a bit tricky to do, as you had to run up and down relay banks knowing what to look for and where. If your center didn’t have a way of “freezing” relay positions, you would also have to be fast, and figure it all out before the call ended (as normally the relays all reset when the call ends).

There’s a description of this here, even in the same context of prank calling a fire station: http://daysgoneby.me/trace-call-1950s-style-took-little-longer/

But it was a very manual process - no big automatic map on the wall that I’m aware of. I suspect this is just a simplifying allegory to scare children into not carelessly dialing phones."
AskHistorians,For how long did colonists assume Native Americans were actually Indians?,"One meta-misunderstanding - a bit like the false claim that the Europe of his day thought the earth was flat - is that Columbus thought he had reached *India* in the sense we usually mean historically (broadly, South Asia), rather than the *Indes*. He didn’t think he had reached the likes of Tamil Nadu or Bengal, but mistook the Taíno and (Island) Carib people of the Caribbean islands for the inhabitants of the eastern ‘spice islands’, or others nearby, mainly of what we’d now call Indonesia. Just as ‘India’ or its cognates was used as a general term by the Persians for the land ‘across the Indus’, the ‘Indes’ was used for islands east of the Indus. The word ‘indios’, translated ‘Indians’ was used fairly carelessly for both or all such contexts, but this doesn’t mean they thought they were the same.

It wasn’t very long that the West was under this misapprehension, even if the name stuck for a very long time: Columbus’ four voyages spanned 1492 to 1504. During that time, three other European explorers reached Newfoundland and/or Labrador (John Cabot - apparently twice, João Fernandes, and the brothers Corte-Real), and five others reached the northern parts of South America (Alonso de Ojeda, Amerigo Vespucci apparently twice, Pinzón, Cabral, and de Bastidas). Most accounts of these either referred to the Indes or stuck to more specific geography (eg, of the specific rivers and islands themselves, or giving a region of mainland Brazil a misconceived name like ‘Island of the True Cross’… or about the peninsulas or islands of what appear to be Newfoundland and Labrador) without a clear picture of how they thought these lands related to the wider world map already know to the east. 

We have two somewhat controversial accounts that claim to be by Vespucci from 1503 and 1505, about his 1499 and 1501 expeditions. In them the author claims to have realised that where he landed in what we would now call South America was part of a whole separate continent. 

It’s also fair to note that most scholars of the day had a reasonably good idea of the size of the earth, based on Eratosthenes’ ancient but surprisingly accurate calculations (there is still discussion about exactly which Greek convention of units he was using, and that he may have had had two errors cancel each other out), and navigators were aware of the distance and direction they had travelled. Ptolemy’s estimate was much smaller, and there was a spread of estimates popular at the time, but Columbus’ view was a minority one distinctly on the shorter end than what most of his contemporaries agreed with, about 70% of the true value. He also took an overly optimistic estimate of the distances involved from by the mathematician Toscanelli.  

Other Italians from Marco Polo to Niccolò de’Conti has made journeys to India and even China, so there was indeed awareness of the differences between India as such and the islands Columbus reached.

So none at any point clearly thought they had reached ‘India’ in the usual sense. Of the first 15 or so European voyages to America within the first 11 years of Columbus’ first, it is unclear what most of them thought, but many scholars would have been able to deduce that the Americas were far, far nearer than the ‘spice islands’ and by the end of those 11 years Vespucci’s widely-read alleged account makes the realisation they’d discovered a ‘new’ continent explicit, and after Waldseemüller wrote his famous map in 1507 (showing the Americas as quite distinct from Asia, and calling South America ‘AMERICA’) this became widespread."
AskHistorians,Is there a service where you can pay a historian to research a specific topic for you?,"I think your first course of action may be to get assistance from a reference librarian. Most academic libraries employ librarians with a specialization in one field or another, and they're very adept in finding materials not available elsewhere. This is especially true for history, as many large libraries also contain archives, and there is often so much material there that only a fraction was digitized. Because you're talking about maritime history, it may be that you can even contact the Department of Navel Records, which are a part of the National Archives, directly.

AskHistorians,"System of a Down's Prison Song claimed that ""The percentage of Americans in the prison system has doubled since 1985"" in 2001. Was this claim true? And if so, how did that come to happen?","The claim is somewhat under-stated. The US incarceration rate more than doubled from 1985 to 2001. In 1985, 0.2% of Americans were in state and federal prisons (and there would have been more in jails, including people awaiting trial - the 0.2% in state and federal prison only included those sentenced). By the end of 2001, this had increased to 0.47%. The increase in incarceration rate began in the 1970s, with the rate doubling from 1973 (0.096%) to 1985.

To see this graphically, see:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png

Adding those in jail (city/county) rather than prison (state and federal) brings the 2001 incarceration rate to 0.69%. This was a very high incarceration rate, and was thought to be the world's highest in 2018:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_map_of_prison_population_rates_from_World_Prison_Brief.svg

(the World Prison Brief database now lists the US rate as the world's 6th highest, behind El Salvador, Cuba, Rwanda, Turkmenistan, and American Samoa).

> And if so, how did that come to happen?

In a few words: the War on Drugs. While the War on Drugs has done very little, if anything, to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the US, and their availability and use in the US, it did manage to put many, many people into US prisons. This was a large part of the growth of the prison population in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, the introduction and spread of ""three strikes"" laws (Washington in 1993, California in 1994, and many states after that) resulted in a large growth of the prison population for violent and property offences. Unsurprisingly, sentencing people to 50-life for shoplifting (in one case, 9 video tapes) increases the prison population. Another factor was mandatory sentencing, effectively forcing judges to often send people to prison for long stays even if they felt that it was unjust.

In the early 2000s, the growth of the incarceration slowed, and it peaked in 2007, and has dropped somewhat since (but remains very, very high by world standards).

AskHistorians,"Did West Berlin truly have a uniquely wild nightlife, and if so, why? And what effect would this have had on the fall of the wall?","The short answer is yes, West Berlin did have a uniquely wild nightlife and there were several reasons for that. First is the geography. West Berlin was surrounded by East Germany and was essentially isolated from the West. This gave it the feel of a small island and thus made it easy to form artistic and social connections. One quote from the time sums it up: “I knew all these people and saw them every day. Everyone permanently spent their nights in the same happening bars. At one point you’d sit next to someone and you’d have an interesting conversation. And when you saw him again two days later, he probably would have been awake the whole time.""  


Second was the nihilism. Across Europe in the late 1970s and 1980s there was a general feeling that nuclear war was imminent and that feeling was amplified in Berlin by both its location and the state of the city which still showed extensive damage from the Second World War. If the world was going to end then you might as well party now. The sentiment was reflected in the lyrics of the time - “Bis zum Kollaps night viel Zeit / Drei Jahre noch” - “Not much time until the collapse / Just three more years”.  


The third factor was the people. West Berlin attracted a certain type of person, primarily because if you lived in West Berlin you avoided having to do military service. In the words of Alexander Hacke and Jochen Arbeit from the West Berlin band Einstürzende Neubauten. West Berlin was “a place for people who wanted to hide because they had escaped from places where they couldn’t develop freely”. These people “lived in this city and didn’t know what to do with themselves so… they became musicians and artists”. Of course these kinds of people are exactly who you need to kick off a wild nightlife.  


There was an absence of industry in West Berlin but these people didn’t have to worry too much about money. The rent was really low for a start (around 90DM a month, or free if you lived in a squat). Also every West Berliner received a ten percent supplement on their salary to make West Berlin artificially attractive. This meant that life was cheap and you didn’t have to work much at all.Finally there were the drugs. Speed was the drug of choice but there was also an abundance of cocaine. The former was of high purity and smuggled in from the East. People would regularly stay up all night (or for days at a time) moving on from one bar or club to the next. Places like the Risiko, Dschungel and SO36 were popular nightspots. The Risiko was sparsely decorated - a yellow bar room with stools and a red back room with benches. Often there wouldn’t even be anyone behind the bar so customers just poured their own drinks.  


Hopefully that gives you an idea of the unique circumstances that gave rise to the nightlife of West Berlin. All of the above quotations were taken from “No Beauty Without Danger” which is a collection of interviews with Einstürzende Neubauten by Max Dax and Robert Defcon where they talk extensively about what (night)life was like in the city. I would highly recommend watching the documentary B-Movie: Lust and Sound in West Berlin 1979-1989 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4291066) and the drama Punk Berlin 1982 which gives a great feel for the city (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3397082). Also, searching out interviews with Mark Reeder (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Reeder) is well worthwhile."
AskHistorians,How realistic are the horse racing plots in some Sherlock Holmes stories?,">\- A horse owner publicly trains a horse that is a ringer for his real horse, but the real one is much faster, to deceive the betting public and improve his odds. The real horse is trained in great secrecy so nobody will know the difference.

I can't comment on the other aspects you brought up, but I can comment on this one. This is likely a reference to the story of Thoroughbred racehorse **Bend Or** (1877–1903), who won the 1880 Epsom Derby while being ridden by famous British jockey Fred Archer.

To start off, let's begin with the Sherlock Holmes short stories ""Shoscombe Old Place"" and ""Silver Blaze"" themselves. The first - called ""The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place"" (originally ""The Adventure of the Black Spaniel"") in full - was one of 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle penned, and appeared in the short story collection *The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes.* The story was published in *The Strand Magazine* in the United Kingdom in April 1927.

This first story features a Thoroughbred racehorse named Shoscombe Prince, who is being trained by a Sir Robert Norberton to win the Epsom Derby, which the horse eventually does.

The second story, ""Silver Blaze"" - called ""The Adventure of Silver Blaze"" in full - dates back a bit earlier, and is probably more relevant to the story of Bend Or and the 1880 Epsom Derby. This particular story was published as part of the *The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes*, and appeared in *The Stand Magazine* in December 1892, about 12 years after the ""Bend Or"" story was front-page news. ""Silver Blaze"" focuses on the mysterious disappearance of the Thoroughbred racehorse of the same name on the eve of a race, as well as the murder of the horse's trainer,  John Straker.

Both of these stories came after the 1880 Epsom Derby, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was likely well-aware of the story of Bend Or. The Thoroughbred racehorse Bend Or was foaled in 1877, sired by the racing stallion Doncaster - the winner of the 1873 Epsom Derby - out of the mare Rouge Rose by Thormanby, the winner of the 1860 Epsom Derby, and the leading Thoroughbred sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1869. Bend Or was bred by Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, who owned the Eaton Stud at his home of Eaton Hall in Cheshire.

The Duke of Westminster had established Eaton Stud in 1875 - just five years before the 1880 Epsom Derby - and employed 30 grooms and stable boys. He also had two or three Thoroughbred stallions at stud, and a herd of 20 broodmares. His later stallions would include the offspring of Bend Or, including the Eclipse Stakes winner Orme (b. 1889), by Ormonde - the 1886 English Triple Crown winner and ""horse of the century"" - out of the mare Angelica by Galopin, the 1875 Epsom Derby winner. Ormonde (Bend Or x Lily Agnes, by Macaroni, the 1863 Epsom Derby winner) was also trained by John Porter for the Duke of Westminster.

Overall, Bend Or looked like your typical Thoroughbred racehorse of the time, albeit somewhat larger in size than most other racehorses. He was a chestnut color with a white blaze, and stood at about 16.1 hands (65 inches, 165 cm) high. Being foaled in 1877, he started training for the races as a two-year-old, and had his first race at the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket in July 1879, which he ""won by a length"". He then went on to win the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood; the Prince of Wales Stakes at York; the Triennial Produce Stakes at Newmarket; and the the Rous Memorial Stakes, also at Newmarket.

By this time, Bend Or went from the 7/1 to the 5/1 favorite for the 1880 Epsom Derby, which further went up to 2/1 by the time the Derby began on 26 May 1880. After a close race against the racehorse Robert the Devil - the winner of the Grand Prix de Paris in France, among a few other key English races (7/1 odds vs. Bend Or's 2/1 odds) - Bend Or won the Derby ""by a head"", but had shin inflammation afterwards due to straining in his race vs. Robert the Devil.

However, the co-owners of Robert the Devil - bookmaker Charles Brewer and trainer Charles Blanton - suspected that the Duke of Westminster and his jockey, Fred Archer, of foul play, and immediately launched a complaint after the 1880 Epsom Derby as a result. During the race itself, Robert the Devil had held the lead from early on, and appeared to be the winner of the event until the last leg, when Bend Or surpassed him to beat him by a head. This was credited to Fred Archer being a superior jockey to Edward Rossiter, the jockey for Robert the Devil.

However, Brewer and Blanton claimed that Bend Or ""was not the horse he was represented to be""; and, therefore, all of his race entries - including to the 1880 Epsom Derby - were invalid. If the complaint was granted, this would make Brewer and Blanton's horse - Robert the Devil - the winner of the 1880 Epsom Derby instead. This complaint was lodged on the grounds that Bend Or had been - knowingly or unknowingly - swapped with another foal,  Tadcaster, as a yearling.

For the next 10 days, the complaint was investigated, sending the news and the entire racing industry into a frenzy. The affair was described as ""the biggest scandal in racing since the Running Rein affair of 1844, when a 4-year-old had been illegally entered in the Derby"".

Brewer and Blanton's complaint indeed sounds like something straight out of a Sherlock Holmes story: They alleged that Bend Or's dam was not Rouge Rose, but instead, a mare called Clemence (Newminster, winner of the 1851 St. Leger Stakes x Eulogy, by Euclid, son of  1823 Epsom Derby winner Emilius). At Eaton Stud, both Rouge Rose and Clemence each bore foals sired by Doncaster in 1877. Clemence's foal was Tadcaster, whereas Rouge Rose's foal was Bend Or.

The allegation came from a groom -  Richard Arnull - who formerly worked for the Duke, and who was familiar with both Tadcaster and Bend Or. More on that will be in the reply to this reply.

In short, the Eaton Stud book was brought forth as the Jockey Club investigated the complaint, but the book was found to be riddled with errors that made it impossible to use. As Brewer and Blanton's complaint was unable to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the two had no other evidence other than the groom's allegation, the Jockey Club rejected the complaint. Bend Or was allowed to keep his 1880 Epsom Derby win, and went on to become one of the most popular and successful sires in history. Most racehorses today are his descendants.

However, the rivalry between Bend Or and Robert the Devil would continue. According to horse racing historian Tony Morris:

>""The colt patently failed to stay when odds-on for the St. Leger \[Stakes\], which was won by his old adversary Robert the Devil, and in two later races that season – the Second Great Foal Stakes and the Champion Stakes, both at Newmarket – Bend Or found Robert the Devil too good. On the latter occasion, the margin between them was ten lengths.  
>  
>Bend Or’s reputation undoubtedly suffered a bit in the second half of his 3-year-old campaign, but he came back at four in tremendous style, starting with a victory in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom, where he gave lumps of weight to most of his rivals. Over the Derby course in the Epsom Gold Cup, Bend Or and Robert the Devil were the only runners, and the verdict was as it had been in 1880, again by a slim margin.""

However, the Duke of Westminster also took measures to disprove the rumor that Bend Or, was in fact, Tadcaster - including having Bend Or cover Clemence, Tadcaster's dam, in 1882. The breeding was successful, and produced a filly named Lenity. However, the Duke quickly sold her to a James Machell, and she went on to have an unsuccessful racing career.

Meanwhile, after winning a two-horse race at Doncaster - not to be confused with the horse Doncaster - Tadcaster had been sold by the Duke of Westminster prior to Bend Or winning the 1880 Epsom Derby. However, after the allegations about the mix-up between Bend Or and Tadcaster, Tadcaster's new owner briefly renamed him ""Bend Or II"", before changing his name back to ""Tadcaster"" when the horse returned to racing as a 4-year-old.

Tadcaster - unlike Bend Or - was never a successful racer, and was gelded. He never sired any offspring of his own, though relatives of Tadcaster are still around today.

However, rumors swirled for decades, and in 2011, a genetic study was finally conducted to prove - or disprove - Brewer and Blanton's 1880 complaint. Bend Or's DNA was extracted and compared with DNA from Tadcaster's living relatives, and this new genetic evidence seemed to show that ""Bend Or"" was, in fact, Tadcaster all along. This story likely inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to pen his 1892 short story ""Silver Blaze"", about a secretly-disguised racehorse.

AskHistorians,"When was the last time in history that someone could have read the whole Epic Cycle, of which the Iliad and Odyssey were two parts?","We can count on one hand the ancient witnesses that claim to have read any of the poems --

* Herodotos (second half of 400s BCE) -- implicitly claims to have read the *Kypria*
* Aristotle (second half of 300s BCE) -- claims to have knowledge of the *Kypria* and *Little Iliad*
* Pausanias (100s CE) -- directly claims to have read the *Kypria* and *Little Iliad*; also cites the *Returns* but that one isn't clear-cut

\-- and some scholars don't believe Pausanias.

Some Attic vases dating to the period 550-480 BCE *may possibly* imply awareness of the *Aithiopis* -- they have a Penthesileia + Amazons scene on one side, and a Memnon + Aithiopes scene on the other -- but there's no need to posit first hand knowledge. In general, for the sake of parsimony, knowledge should be assumed to be second hand.

We have no indication that any surviving witness ever had a first hand acquaintance with the text of the *Sack of Ilion* or *Telegony*. Quotations and references that we find in other (and later) sources are typically distilled from earlier scholarship, not based directly on the poems.

We must take it that the summaries attributed to Proklos are ultimately derived from people reading the poems, and some form of summaries seem to have been compiled around the 200s BCE. So, even allowing Pausanias' testimony to stand, **the 3rd century BCE would be our last probable date** for anyone reading a complete text of the actual poems.

Aside from references and quotations in scholastic sources, which as I said are typically distilled from older material rather than from personal research, we find some literary influence in authors like Vergil, Ovid, Quintus of Smyrna, and so on. However, here too it is prudent to assume only second hand knowledge.

1. We know that in Augustan Rome, the creators of the Tabulae Iliacae (tiny carved illustrations of Homeric and Cyclic scenes) did *not* use the poems themselves, but instead drew on summaries of some kind, similar to the ones that still survive.

2. Vergil's and Ovid's use of Cyclic material -- both their replication of Cyclic material (e.g. Vergil's account of the sack of Troy) and intertextual play (e.g. *Aeneid* 7 playing on the *Kypria*) -- is consistent with drawing on summaries comparable to the ones that still survive, rather than detailed knowledge of a poetic text.

We do need to be a *little* bit cautious with the Augustan poets, because we don't have the Cyclic epics to compare with their poems, so we can't actually tell if there's detailed intertextual play on the poems themselves. But (a) there's no powerful reason to assume there is; (b) the ancient commentary on Vergil by Servius shows no sign of any awareness that Vergil is playing on Cyclic material, which implies that whatever he's doing, it's indirect and not well known.

(*Edit:* Horace's parody of the opening line of a Cyclic epic in his *Ars poetica* could in principle be argued to imply that he had personal knowledge of at least one Cyclic epic, probably the *Kypria*, *Little Iliad*, or *Sack of Ilion*. I don't think the argument holds water, and even you accepted that it, it wouldn't imply that copies existed in Rome: Horace would be just as likely to have encountered a copy when he was a student in Athens.)

Other signs that the Cyclic epics were lost early are:

* not a single papyrus fragment of any Cyclic epic has been found; for comparison, we have fragments of ~60 copies of the lost *Catalogue of women*
* Proklos, reproducing a Hellenistic source, writes 'the poems of the Epic Cycle are preserved and have many people interested in them, no so much because of their merit, but because of the continuity of the material in it' (*Chrestomathy* §20 ed. Severyns) -- and notice the present tense: this means the poems are preserved *in the time of Proklos' Hellenistic source* only because of their continuity.

For Vergil's use of Cyclic material, the best published treatment that I know of is

* Kopff, E. C. 1981. 'Virgil and the cyclic epics.' In: W. Haase (ed.), *Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt*, vol. ii.31.2. Berlin. 919-947.

For the fact that the Tabulae Iliacae made use of summaries, rather than the poems themselves, there are some details in the last part of [this offsite piece](http://kiwihellenist.blogspot.com/2020/02/epic-cycle.html) I wrote a few years back."
AskHistorians,Why did Johnny Cash flip the bird at his Fulton County performance?,"First, that shot was from his set at San Quentin State Prison, in 1969. It's also the one he used for the full page ad in Billboard after winning the Grammy for Best Country Album for Unchained, after Nashville snubbed him and country radio gave it no airtime.

The simple answer, is that photographer Jim Marshall, who had done a lot of work with Cash, asked him what he thought of the prison authorities. [""John, let's do a shot for the warden!""](https://www.nme.com/news/music/johnny-cash-19-1292708), and the legendary photo was born. The story is related in his final book, Pocket Cash.

The context is that Cash performed at least 30 times in prison, including the ones from his two famous albums (Live at Folsom Prison, Live at San Quentin), and had been arrested at least 7 times (though never spent more than a night in jail), for drugs, intoxication, or actions under the influence. His first trip to Folsom Prison made him hugely popular and inundated him with requests to play at prisons, and Cash always empathized with them. His themes, from the very beginning, were about looking out for the marginalized, the poor, about fighting against closed-mindedness (not just bigotry), and the like. 

>""I wore black because I liked it. I still do, and wearing it still means something to me. It's still my symbol of rebellion -- against a stagnant status quo, against our  hypocritical houses of God, against people whose minds are closed to  others' ideas."" 

Simply put, Cash had always identified with prisoners against the establishment, and his deep anti-establishment streak was why Nashville never really welcomed him even while he was the most popular country artist.  In fact, he was very much *not* there ""just to perform and cause a stir"", he was quite political (if not partisan). He was anti-war and he spoke positively about others who were, which was *not popular at all* with the country establishment(What is Truth, Singing in Vietnam Talking Blues, Drive On), he empathized with drug addicts and prisoners (Folsom Prison Blues, San Quentin, Sunday Morning Coming Down), sang and acted for Native American Rights (Old Apache Squaw, The Ballad of Ira Hayes), sang about interracial relationships (White Girl), and he sung and donated against gun violence (supporting the Pax charity in later life) (Don’t Take Your Guns To Town). 

So the real answer?

AskHistorians,"In the later Roman Empire, the Senate would inaugurate new emperors with the blessing that they would hopefully ""be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan"". Why was Augustus considered to be the more fortunate of the two emperors, while Trajan was considered to be the better one?","It's important to note that we're discussing rhetoric, and, further, rhetoric as applied by a sociopolitical class in sheer decline (with respect to real power) toward the individuals directly responsible for said decline. Under the empire, the constitutional balance of powers had shifted as such that the Senate was no longer a state power in its own right, but rather an extension of state power as wielded by the imperial family; to that end, praise for the emperor could be quite self-serving for the procurement and maintenance of prestige for oneself and of longevity for the ""organization"" or ""class"" which served as the vehicle of said prestige. 

This rhetoric needn't be accurate nor logical (i.e., internally cohesive), merely effectual and pragmatic. The later reference, *felicior augusto, melior traiano*, then, merely need exist in a sociocultural fabric in which Augustus is understood as *felix* and Trajan as *bonus*. This doesn't *have* to say anything about which one functioned as a more capable governmental administrator, or whether such capability would, theologically, imply some degree of favor from the gods, only that these emperors were both notable in some way, and that as it pertains to their notable qualities, it would be a good thing were the next emperor to not only embody those qualities (i.e., Augustan felicity and Trajanian amiability), but to surpass these referents in that respect. The appellation functions as a piece of political propaganda for dynasty creation, and, within the context of the fourth century it's a hopeful one, given the previous century's crises. 

Further, it must be said that these senatorial praises and epithets exist only within the existing sociopolitical context of an ""imperial discourse"", one as established at the first heartbeat of the Augustan Principate and propagated down. It is merely an echo of the emperors' own self-mythologized figure and of their divinizing character, construed by imperial authors as the ultimate role model for the Roman citizen, inventing a rhetorical link between traditional Latin Republican virtue (as well as Aeneidic *pietas*) and the function of the emperor as *princeps*. The success of and praise for Trajan, ultimately, is rooted in praise for Augustus as the protector and expander of that which he created. See Eutropius 8.2: *Romani imperii, quod post Augustum defensum magis fuerat quam nobiliter ampliatum, fines longe lateque diffudit*; ""Far and wide did he spread the boundaries of the Roman Empire, which had, after Augustus, been protected rather than nobly expanded"". 

To that end, you can see how Augustus could be seen as a blessed and divine son whose work established the course by which the later emperors would be judged. He set the imperial ship of state into motion, and later authors would argue that Trajan was a good captain in that legacy. The autobiography of these magnetized figures, in conjunction with public discourse and upper class writings (as funded through imperial benefaction), served to create a lasting mythos of what it meant to be a ""good"" emperor, and one could be judged by the extent to which they aligned with or fractured off of this imperial image.

AskHistorians,How do we know that the Greeks really believed in their gods?,"Besides the FAQ, I can much recommend [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ny466j/comment/h1ie0jy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/Iphikrates which more directly answers your question. As he points out, dedications in temples and the prominence of oracles are good evidence that the gods were seriously thought to help humans.

Generally, the ancient Greeks had varied beliefs about the gods, which could exist in a religion that did not have religious dogma or set 'Scripture'. Many philosophers criticised the traditional anthropomorphic portrayal of the gods in the Homeric epics, and held views like that the gods are actually representations of a single Divinity, or that the gods live in a state of untroubledness and that phenomena on Earth are caused by atoms. There were some more radical philosophical ideas too: for instance Euhemerus proposed that the gods were actually human rulers who had been deified in the past, and Prodicus held a view much like the one you describe, that the gods were just personifications of aspects of nature; but neither of these ideas were very popular. I can also point to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/da0cmj/comment/f1mxw3q/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/toldinstone, which, though focused on the Romans, summarise the philosophical theologies available in Antiquity, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v8m1s7/is_atheismagnosticism_a_purely_modern_phenomenon/) by u/Spencer_A_McDaniel, where she explains the few Greek thinkers we could call atheists or agnostics.

AskHistorians,"How did the pro-business, anti-worker attitude that is prevalent in modern society come about?","My short answer would be that by the late 1970s-80s, we were in the long tail of a vehement war on labor unions. So rather than looking for a turning point during that era--which would be somewhat intuitive based on the number of union members hitting its peak in 1979--those decades were merely seeing the consequences of, among other factors, the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. The peak for *union density*, as opposed to real numbers of union members, occurred in 1954 (I'm taking these figures from wikipedia, but this is in line with scholarly sources that I've read.)

Labor historian Thomas Sugrue, in *The Origins of the Urban Crisis,* locates that turning point during what we consider the heyday of union membership, during the 1950s. Owners of factories in urban cores began a process of deindustrialization: moving operations out of city centers, where their unionized workforces lived. Managers and executives relocated to these new factories and offices, which were often built in ""right to work"" states (something made possible by Taft-Hartley). Labor unions were weakened by the fact of their being left behind, unable or unwilling to relocate. (The Congress of Industrial Organizations tried, unsuccessfully, to organize workers in the Southeast, part of the ""Sun Belt"" where factory owners were moving their operations. The existence of whole regions of the country where unions lacked a presence allowed deindustrialization to be an effective tool at breaking the power of labor unions.) In addition to relocating their factories, owners of businesses also introduced automated, robotic processes into their shops, either as a threat to unions or to replace organized workers who were striking or threatening to strike. The significant expense of deindustrialization demonstrates both the power of unions and the strong desire of business owners to gain absolute control over their workforce.

Taft-Hartley also demanded that unions purge their ranks of communists and other ""radicals."" The Communist Party was a significant force in labor organizing during the 1920s and 1930s in particular. The major unions went along with this rather willingly. 

By the 1950s, business owners were going on the offense. World War II was over, and industrial demand had decreased and the labor force was no longer at full employment. Meanwhile, the priorities of union leadership had shifted to ""bread and butter"" organizing--focusing on higher wages and shorter hours, for example, as opposed to working toward worker control of the means of production. In 1950, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) signed a contract with the ""Big Three"" automakers, known as the Treaty of Detroit. The five-year contract locked in the wage and workplace demands of the union in return for a promise not to strike. This is emblematic of the compromise approach that unions were turning to: either because they were going on the defensive or because of shifting priorities as their internationals swelled in membership. The UAW had over a million members by 1953. See *The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit* by Nelson Lichtenstein for more about the UAW and the Treaty of Detroit.

While this period marks a turning point in US labor history, it's worth mentioning that the labor organizing that took place during the New Deal era (especially after the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935) is somewhat anomalous in a longer history of labor. The ""Gilded Age"" of the late 1800s saw business owners exploit workers to an unprecedented degree--low wages, no social safety net, dangerous working conditions, and plenty of racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination. The Supreme Court under Melville Fuller issued rulings that weakened workers' rights in favor of promoting a laissez-faire economy. Organizing efforts from the end of Reconstruction until the Wagner Act faced considerable legal hurdles as well as labor market pressures and cultural biases. Racism, nativism, and sexism divided the workforce. 

In short, labor history from the end of World War II through the 1980s, while not entirely linear, is one of slow decline. The big unions had to overcome structural and legal obstacles, some of which have a rather long legacy, while deciding whether to put their resources into organizing or bargaining. The fact that the air traffic controller union PATCO endorsed Reagan in 1980, before he fired their striking workers, is evidence that labor was on its back foot by that era, looking for compromise wherever they could get it rather than demanding concessions from employers as in an earlier era."

AskHistorians,What does Charon do with his eye-coins in Greek mythology? What is he buying? Does he hoard them or toss them away?,"> “…and they lived happily ever after,” concluded the storyteller, closing the book.

>“And then what happened?” the little boy asked.

The above is a common joke about the end of stories. Stephen King says that readers sometimes ask him what happened to his characters after the end of his books. In the trial over the book Lady Chatterly’s Lover, one of the prosecutors wanted to know what happened to the adulterous characters after the end of the book. Did they marry and live together like good, God-fearing man and wife? Or did they live in debauched sin?

Well, the writer D.H. Lawrence didn’t know what happened to Lady Chatterly, just like Stephen King doesn’t know what happens to his characters after The End is typed. The story ends when it ends. In effect, you are asking “and then what happened?” after the end of the story.

To the people in the ancient world, the coin was to pay the fare so people could to continue the journey in the afterlife. This was its only purpose.

> Hercules : An ancient mariner will row you over in a wee boat, so big. The fare's two obols.

> Dionysius : Fie! The power two obols have, the whole world through! …

> Charon : Now pay your fare and go.

Strabo, Geography


> He peremptorily demands the fare, and when he receives it he transports travellers on his stitched-up craft over to the further shore. (So even among the dead, greed enjoys its life; even that great god Charon, who gathers taxes for Hades, does not do anything for nothing. A poor man on the point of death must find his fare, and no one will let him breathe his last until he has his copper ready.) 

Apuleius, The Golden Ass

An ancient poet somewhere could use the phrase “Charon’s hoard” or something of that nature, but this would be for a precise rhetorical effect. It would in no way imply that the ancients believed Charon hoarded coins. (Note: I looked and looked for a phrase like this but couldn’t find anything.)

The coin’s story ends when it changes hands. Was it hoarded, or did Charon use it to buy things from the other dwellers of Hades in some afterlife economy? From a narrative point of view that question makes no sense. There are no more pages left in the book. The story is instead about the human, and what happens to them – to us – when we come to meet the ferryman. That is what the ancients were interested in."

AskHistorians,What is the context behind the picture of the two men holding a sign in 1977 San Francisco saying 'A gay landlord is still a landlord'?,"Well, I have a strong suspicion someone certainly tried to create that impression by cropping the damned photo to completely remove the context of what the original actually implies.

I'm slightly salty here as I view an action like this as about one step up from repeating conspiracy theories.  It took quite a bit of reverse image searching to even track down the credits, which are conveniently omitted in the mass of reposts of this on social media to the point where I wasn't even sure the suggestion of the date and location were accurate.

Fortunately, after going through about 200 or so I finally tracked down the photographer; this was fortunate, as I was close to giving up and wasting even more time digging into the rent control battles in San Francisco of that era, which is what my initial hunch was that it might reflect.  It's from [Marie Ueda](https://marie-ueda.com/), a photojournalist for *The Guardian* who lived in San Francisco in the late 1970s and was [one of the few to document](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7s2036zz/?&brand=oac4) the movement; most of these generally would not have shown up in any of the local papers.  Fortunately, she's released much of this to the academically curated Online Archive of California, and you can look up her 1977-1979 camera rolls from San Francisco's Gay Day Parades [here](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/search?style=attached;relation=ark:/13030/kt7s2036zz;page=1); one of her more iconic photos of Harvey Milk [on the steps of City Hall during the 1978 Gay Day Parade](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt5c60367v/?brand=oac4) was clearly used as the basis for a scene in the *Milk* movie.   A relevant side note on this is that the nomenclature of this is important as well; one thing that gets glossed over nowadays is the friction between lesbians and gays of that era (other parts of the LGBTIA+ spectrum were almost entirely ignored by both of them), and renaming it as a more inclusive ""Pride"" doesn't take place until the 1980s.

So [here's the uncropped photo](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt9m3nf5z3/?brand=oac4); it does indeed date from the 1977 Gay Day Parade on June 26, 1977.  But look behind them.  You know who else is marching?  Those incredible anti-establishment revolutionaries, gay law students from what look to be several of the law schools around the SF Bay Area, who you can see closer [here](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt5p303559/?brand=oac4).  What's one of their signs say?  ""Your lawyers are gay too!""  Another photo provides further context.  This is the [group marching just in front of them](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt7g503763/?brand=oac4), with an Episcopal minister who carries a placard ""demand[ing] for gay people basic human rights.""  An appropriate message, but not exactly revolutionary or anti-establishment.  

And here's the kicker - here's [a different shot of the couple in the main picture] (http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt738nf669/?brand=oac4) where you can see what they're wearing a bit more clearly - more specifically, that one is wearing a t-shirt with ""Faggot Revolution"".  I'd take it as his focus being on basic human rights for gays - that they exist everywhere, including potentially your landlord - rather than calling into question property rights.

This appears to the main theme of that year's parade - that gays existed among all groups, and that they deserved freedom and recognition.  You can see more photos expressing this [here](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0m3nd81b/?brand=oac4) from a disabled group, [here](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt367nf1rk/?brand=oac4) on a float, [here](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt1s2033gd/?brand=oac4) with POC members expressing a comment we'd recognize today, ""Gay Rights are Human Rights,"" and [here](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt7d5nf4s3/?brand=oac4) in one I'd think would be one of the first prototypes of a gay-straight alliance along with what looks to be a group of Chinese speakers behind them.

That last photo is probably the most relevant as it has ""Anita Sucks"" and ""No Dade Co. in San Francisco"" signs in the group, which is a reference to what marchers in 1977 were really concerned with - that 19 days earlier, Anita Bryant had been successful in her campaign to repeal Miami-Dade county's anti-discrimination ordinance.

AskHistorians,Did the ancient Polynesian Navigators suffer from Scurvy?,"We don't have any good evidence of scurvy among traditional Polynesian sailors. This isn't surprising, considering the following two factors:

**Duration of voyages:** Most single-leg voyages were 500 nautical miles (nm) or shorter. Very few were longer than 1300nm. A typical voyaging canoe averaged a speed of about 4 knots, so would cover about 100nm in day. Thus, with typical weather conditions, most voyages were about 5 days, or less. A very long voyage at average speed would have taken about 2 weeks. Generally, long voyages would make use of favourable prevailing winds, so it's reasonable to expect that they could maintain the typical average speed, or better, for most voyages. Thus, it would have been a very rare voyage that reached 5 or 6 weeks in duration.

Usually, major symptoms of scurvy appear between 8-12 weeks into vitamin C deprivation, so we wouldn't expect any significant scurvy, even if the provisions carried were very low in vitamin C.

**Provisions:** Much of the food carried provided good amounts of vitamin C. Early in the voyage, food would include fresh sweet potatoes, taro, breadfruit, bananas, yams, and coconuts. Many of these keep longer than just a few days, so fresh food like this might last rhough all or at least most of a short voyage. Sweet potatoes, taro, yams, and breadfruit could also be fermented and dried, or just dried (if fermented and dried, they would keep for a longer period - over 100 years in the case of fermented breadfruit, if old reports are to be believed). Fermentation and drying could be carried out after cooking, eliminating any need to cook such provisions on board. (A voyaging canoe would typical include a coral or stone lined hearth, for on-board cooking, but food that didn't need cooking would still have been useful in bad weather, and if firewood (often coconut husks) ran out.) Dried fish (and other dried seafood) provided animal protein.

Thus, their shipboard diet was typically much higher in vitamin C than the scurvy-inducing European sailors diet of hardtack (ship's biscuit) and salted meat.

Together, the relatively short voyages (compared to multi-month European voyages) and more vitamin C rich provision would mean a much lower incidence of scurvy. The lack of reports of scurvy among Polynesian voyagers is quite credible and simply reflects this lower scurvy risk.

We can also ask about the low incidence of scurvy among East Asian and SE Asian sailors. The answers are similar - most voyages weren't too long, and provisions included foods rich in vitamin C. In particular, Chinese sailors would carry pickled vegetables - note that Cook's scurvy-free circumnavigation of the earth included about 3.5 tons of sauerkraut among its provisions. It's also thought that freshly-sprouted soybeans might have been another rich source of vitamin C for Chinese sailors."
AskHistorians,Why was Cavalry so extensively used in the Russian civil war? Hadn’t WWI showed that it was obsolete in the face of advanced artillery & machine guns?,"I'm sure someone can give a better/more detailed answer, but I'll take a crack at this just to address some underlying assumptions.

Firstly: The Russian Civil War, despite occurring in the same era as WWI was a *very* different war than the typical imagining of WWI (which, in truth, is usually based on the Western Front almost exclusively). Machine Guns and Artillery had greatly diminished the efficacy of cavalry attacks and maneuvers, this much is true. However a large part of Cavalry's irrelevance in WWI is only really found in the Western Fronts (France, Italy, Serbia). This is because these fronts featured a high concentration of forces across a relatively small frontline (remember in France there millions upon millions of troops spread across a frontline less than 500 miles long). On top of that these forces were generally well equipped with ample supplies and weaponry. In the Italian and Serbian front you have less well-equipped and less numerous forces but also smaller frontlines and much more difficult and mountainous terrain, ill-suited for cavalry maneuvers.

The Eastern Front of WWI, by comparison was a much more mobile affair. The infrastructure of the East was poor compared to the West (and generally got worse the further East you went) and the frontline much, much larger. On top of that most of the territory was plains and forests. It also, broadly, had less troops manning it than the Western Front (though, at present I'm having difficulty finding a specific figure/source) and troops (particularly Russian troops) tended to have difficulties with obtaining adequate arms and supplies. Long and short: bad infrastructure (including rail lines), mostly flat terrain, huge frontlines, less troops, poor access to modern military equipment, made the Eastern front a much more mobile war that was far better suited for cavalry warfare.

In the Russian Civil War (and the Polish-Soviet War), we have a similar situation only now in a war where both sides suffered from lacking equipment. Lacking adequate supplies to sustain a fully modernized and large army, many units and commanders utilized otherwise unorthodox tactics and strategies such as the fabled [Tachanka's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachanka). Forces like Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army became prized forces as the open terrain, poor supplies, and lacking mechanization made cavalry a highly effective means of conducting operations. All sides in the Civil War (and its spillover conflicts) had significant issues with supply, equipment, and their economies; making cavalry a fairly affordable and useful tool which was quite capable of stacking up against more loosely organized and more poorly equipped infantry/artillery units

The success of these cavalry units on all sides of the conflict would instill a great degree of confidence in the efficacy of cavalry in modern warfare, both in the Soviet high command, but also in states such as Poland. Without trying to diagnose it too much, I think it's safe to say that many of these officers believed that future conflict would resemble the most recent. This is why you have cases such as Mashal Semyon Budyonny insisting in the lead-up to WWII that Cavalry would continue to be the predominant offensive force in the military. Based on his civil war experience, that makes sense: but facing against a more organized, mechanized, numerous, and better equipped modern force cavalry pretty quickly diminishes in efficacy."
AskHistorians,Miyamoto Musashi makes reference to the ten abilities and seven arts of old. This can be found in the earth scroll in his book of five rings. What the heck were the 10 abilities and 7 arts?,"Not being a Musashi scholar, I'm unsure if he clarified the ""ten abilities"" (*juunou* 十能) or ""seven arts"" (*shichi waza* 七技, really ""seven techniques"") in further writings, or if practitioners of the Niten Ichi Ryu have different ""secret"" ideas for what it represents. The seven arts are also written as 七藝 with 藝 being an old way of writing 芸 (*gei*). Both 芸 and 技 can mean ""technique"", though 芸 has a bit more nuance to it. The key point to understand is that 芸 in this context is a reference to *bugei* 武芸 or ""warrior arts,"" more specifically the *bugei juuhappan* 武芸十八般 or 18 warrior arts. 

The *bugei juuhappan* is a reference to the various skills warriors in pre-Edo and Edo Japan would ""learn"" prior to when martial art schools that focused on a specific teaching like sword, spear, bow, etc popped up. These were sougou bujutsu 総合武術 or ""complete"" martial arts. Various *koryu* 古流 (classical martial arts) like Katori Shinto Ryu 香取神道流, Kashima Shin Ryu 鹿島神流, Yagyu Shinkage Ryu 柳生新影流, Nen Ryu 念流, Chujo Ryu 中條流, etc would teach the metaphorical ""18 arts"" to their practitioners. 

I say ""metaphorical"" here because some schools would teach everything, some schools would teach a subset, and there was no guarantee that the list was the same across every school or even every source that referenced the teachings. It wasn't a fixed curriculum; I mean, there wasn't an organization that existed to say ""this is the list of teachings that martial arts must have."" This concept was instead born of the warrior's need in those days, a need to use the body in a certain way that could translate into using a variety of tools and skills regardless of the situation. The movement theory was such that the same body science concept for using a sword would be the same as using a spear, using a bow and arrow, engaging in unarmed combat, etc. It's a mysterious thing that even Zeami Motokiyo 世阿弥元清 of Noh fame talks about. The martial art schools listed above all have such movement theories.

To get back to the 18 arts, there was a list of skills from the Zhou Dynasty 周朝 in China that were supposedly shared amongst warriors, but like the *bugei juuhappan*, those skills varied depending upon era and source. The Ming Dynasty work *Wuzazu* 五雜俎 by Xie Zhaozhe 謝肇淛 references 十八般兵器 (ch. *shi ba ban bing qi*, jp. *bugei juuhappan heiki* or 18 weapons of the warrior arts) which is the same concept as the *bugei juuhappan*, just focusing on weapons. According to one translation, those were- 

* 弓 = *gong* (bow & arrow)
* 弩 = *nu* (crossbow)
* 槍 = *qiang* (spear)
* 刀 = *dao* (single-edge broadsword)
* 剣 = *jian* (double-edge sword)
* 矛 = *mao* (spear with snake-like blade)
* 盾 = *dun* (shield)
* 斧 = *fu* (battleaxe)
* 鉞 = *yue* (crescent moon knives)
* 戟 = *ji* (spear with 2 crescent blades on the side)
* 鞭 = *bian* (iron baton)
* 鐧 = *jian* (metal truncheon)
* 撾 = *zhua* (claw-mounted polearm)
* 殳 = *shu* (three-edge spear)
* 叉 = *cha* (trident)
* 耙 = *ba* (rake)
* 綿縄套索 = *miansheng taosuo* (brocade lasso)
* 白打 = *da bai* (empty hands)

Hirayama Kōzō published a book *Bugei Juuhappan Ryakusetsu* 武芸十八般略説 in the early 19th century and referenced the skills below. Notice there are only 16. The concept of ""well-roundedness"" is the important point here- 

* 弓 = *yumi* (bow/archery)
* 李満弓 = *rimankyu*, covering short bows
* 弩 = *ishiyumi* (crossbow)
* 馬 = *uma* (horsemanship)
* 刀 = *tou* / katana (sword)
* 大刀 = *ou-dachi*, long swords like what you might here called a *nodachi*
* 抽刀 = *chuutou* (drawing sword)
* 眉尖刀 = *bisentou*, like a glaive with a really large blade
* 青竜刀 = *seiryuutou*, like a *naginata* 長刀 (also a type of glaive) but with a sword blade at the end
* 槍 = *yari* (spear)
* 鏢鎗 = *hyousou*, like a javelin or throwing spear
* 棍 = *kon* (sticks/staves)
* 鉄鞭 = *tetsuben*, like a *jutte* / *jitte* 十手 (truncheon) that would be used my police to arrest people
* 飛鑓 = *hiken*, sometimes related to *kusari gama* (鎖鎌, chain & sickle) and *koran-jou* (虎乱杖, staff with a chain hidden inside it)
* 拳 = *yawara* (unarmed fighting)
* 銃 = *ju* (guns/muskets)

You can also find variations with *kisha* 騎射 (shooting from horseback), *iai* 居合 (sword drawing), *kenjutsu* 剣術 (swordsmanship in general), *boujutsu* 棒術 (stick/staff fighting), *juujutsu* 柔術 (grappling/unarmed fighting, though this is a catch-all term when talking about historical Japanense martial arts), and many other specific weapons or weapon families. Some lists even leave weapons out and focus on skills like *ninjutsu* 忍術 (espionage/ninja stuff), *suieijutsu* 水泳術 (swimming), *ongyoujutsu* 隠形術 (concealing techniques), *kacchuuden* 甲冑伝 (how to wear armor), even *suibajutsu* 水馬術 (crossing water with a horse).

The key point to all this is that the skills and arts Musashi refers to are likely the general teachings that warriors would/should know, regardless of whether they were formal technique teachings like you might see today (#1, #2, etc) or purely conceptual based on the movement theory of the time. Sorry I don't know the exact teachings he was referring to. In the martial arts I study, there are a few variations of the *bugei juuhappan* so he might have meant different teachings at different times!"

AskHistorians,"Almost all English words for spatial measurements end in ""th"" (breadth, depth, width, length, etc) except for ""height."" Why don't we say ""heighth?""","It is just a quirk of linguistics. *heighth* / *highth* was perfectly acceptable and was common until the 19th century. This is a common question in English linguistic circles and is a favorite fun fact on grammar blogs. Modern English *height* is a dialect variant which crept its way in about 1200 CE and eventually booted out its host, for unknown reasons. Some suggest there was something about the final /-h-/ in the stem which tripped up speakers. There are at least two more examples, but I am struggling to recall them now. I had thought ""wight"" was  one, but that's not correct. Neither is ""draught.""

The word ""height"" in Old English is *hiehþu*, with the thorn (*þ*) making our /-th-/ sound. This is just the root *heah* ""high"" plus the Germanic abstract noun suffix *-itha-*.

AskHistorians,How did the Mafia lose control over Las Vegas and was it really a better tourist experience when they operated ?,"Not to rehash [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bty4em/comment/ep6q7ez/) too much, but I'll extend a little on my explanation there for why organized crime is no longer connected with casino ownership.

As I mentioned there, several potential explanations are at hand. The first is the **generational** one, in which the ex-bootlegger cohort of men born c. 1900 were dying out. With their children mostly going legit and organized crime focusing more on narcotics and other sources of income than gambling after the 1960s, mobsters no longer had any real connection to gambling. It was a common path for bootleggers to diversify into illegal horse betting rooms, bookmaking, slot machine routes, and illegal casinos in the 1920s/1930s, but it would be difficulty to imagine (taking a fictional example) Tony Montana transitioning from cocaine into bingo. 

Second, the federal government ratcheted pressure on the mob, with several high-profile cases intersecting with Las Vegas. I call this the **""leviathan explanation.""** That removed some players from the scene, but there still remains the question of why new players didn't fill the void. 

That might be explained by the third hypothesis, which is that **finance and operations** shifted to be unfavorable to those with mob connections. 

Imagine you are opening a Las Vegas casino in 1950. You need money to build it, players to fill it, and a way to collect gambling debts (a small but significant amount of play in those days was on credit). No mainstream bank or lender will give you money to build a casino, since they are so risky. But those who already know the business can assess the risk, and might fund you. Advantage: mob. And, before the development of database marketing, if you want to find the gamblers in any given city, you'll want to hire the bookies and those already in the gambling business, which is by definition an organized crime. Advantage: mob. Finally, gambling debts were not then legally collectable. So you could ask politely and hope for the best, or ask politely with a credible threat--real or implied--behind you. Advantage:mob.

After the 1960s, the success of casino resorts was proven, and mainstream investors became interested. At the same time, casino hotels became larger and more expensive to build. The Sands (1952), opened with 200 rooms at the cost of $4.5 million, while the International (1969) opened with 1,500 rooms at a cost of $50 million--far beyond what mobsters could afford. 

In addition, changes to the law (collection of gambling debts being legalized) and technology (player databases and direct marketing) eliminated other mob advantages.

So, by the early 1980s, organized crime had few advantages and many disadvantages when it came to owning Las Vegas casino resorts.

The second half of your question, whether the customer experience was better, is that it depends on who you were.

Imagine our c. 1950-1965 casino as a machine designed above all to funnel gamblers to 3-4 craps tables. That's where the big action was, though blackjack was gaining in popularity. Slot machines were a diversion, not a revenue stream. In that environment, casino personnel would know even moderate players, and would extend them every courtesy.

But if you were black, you would not be allowed into the casino as a paying customer (at least until 1960) and you would have very few employment opportunites (all of them menial). Women, too, were not hired as dealers in Las Vegas, and were typically not managers. So there are certain issues when people rhapsodize about the ""good old days"" of Las Vegas. Because it was much smaller, it may have been friendlier for some, but certainly not for all.

From a material standpoint, the quantity and quality of amenities is now far, far greater than it ever was. If you are interested in food, here is a [virtual exhibit of vintage Las Vegas menus](https://special.library.unlv.edu/collections/menus/dining-las-vegas). Should give you an idea of what fine dining looked like.

AskHistorians,"Is ""Doomsday prepping"" or prepping in general a more modern thing, or are there documented cases of people doing it in the past?",[removed]
AskHistorians,"What were the real names of the kings of England after the Norman conquest? That is, in their native language. eg: was King Stephen really Etienne? or Estienne? How were kings names pronounced?","Hello!

So you are correct that the names would not be the exact same as we understand or read them in (early modern and forward) English, as they would've spoken the Old Norman language colloquially, the antecedent of Norman French - what in England they would've called *Anglo-Norman.*

However, it should be noted that Old French was the mother tongue of every English king from William the Conqueror up to Henry IV, when English was given importance by Henry IV. He took the oath in Middle English, and his son Henry V wrote in Middle English. So we can point to the Medieval period in England having three languages: English, French, and Norman - in their old forms, obviously!

From this knowledge of languages used, we can then make a conjecture based on what names would be in Old French, which would more than likely have been the ""true"" names, with their cognates in English. I will give an example below.

William, in English, becomes ""Williame"" in Anglo-Norman or ""Guillaume"" in French - for William the Conqueror and William II.

Henry was used in Old French alongside Henri, for the first three kings with the name Henry.

Stephen would've been ""Estiene"" or ""Estienne"", from which the modern ""Étienne"" comes.

Matilda would've been ""Mahaute"", from which ""Empress Maude"" comes.

Richard, to my knowledge, would've been the same in Anglo-Norman, English, and French.

John would have ""Jean"" or ""Jehan"".

Edward is an interesting case. When Edward I was born, his father King Henry III wished to give him an Anglo-Saxon name to venerate Edward the Confessor. Edward was not a common name amongst the aristocracy or gentry of the Anglo-Norman ruling classes, so it was an unorthodox choice. Nevertheless, ""Edward"" in English becomes ""Édouard"" in French and we can presume Old French was indeed similar.

By the time of Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V, Middle English had begun to shift to be the language of administration and quotidian life amongst the upper classes and French fell out of first-language usage by the English Kings.

Many of the above names are visible in documents written in the Middle Ages, such as the [Peterborough Chronicle](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/manuscript_7423), [the Genealogical chronicle of the English Kings](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/genealogical-chronicle-of-the-english-kings), and other manuscript documents.

AskHistorians,Why did men stop wearing hats?,"There's always more that can be said, but I have a past answer on this that I'll paste below:

John F. Kennedy's lack of interest in formal headwear (because remember, fedoras are not the only type of hat, and today many men wear baseball caps/trucker hats) may have been a factor, but while it's tempting to attribute sea changes in fashion to famous individuals' personal preferences, this was part of a general trend of casualization in everyday dress for men and women.

Over the course of the twentieth century, the increasing availability of college to the middle class led to ""college culture"" becoming more defined and shared by more people. While hats continued to be seen as normal aspects of campus dress for female and male students through the 1930s, during and after World War II, youth culture began to regard them as unnecessary and conservative. (Other key features of casual college dress were jeans, especially on women; shorts for men and women; the oversized women's cardigan, called the ""sloppy joe""; flannel shirts and lumberjack coats; sweatshirts; and tennis shoes.) When hats, suits, and more formal dress were worn on college campuses, it was because they were mandated by dress codes in the stricter and more formal schools, like Radcliffe.

As the students who were used to dressing this way grew up, their values eventually became the new ordinary middle class values - of course many conformed to the standards of ""adult dress"" when they graduated, but these changes never happen overnight. Eventually, there were enough adults hanging onto the college style that it became acceptable to bring many of these items into the casual and, in some cases (such as hats), even professional wardrobes outside of college campuses. In addition, going forward into the 1960s, you have the hippie movement and its co-option into everyday fashion (which again related to youth culture on college campuses): rejecting the professional, suited norms of the 1950s even if you were not actually going to wear a poncho and live on a commune.

As you've noticed, there is a Great Man argument regarding Kennedy just deciding not to wear hats and the nation - heck, the globe - following suit, but it's clearly more a symptom rather than a cause. Some also make practical, common-sense arguments regarding the height of a car ceiling or less need for protection from the elements, but I find them unlikely. Good-quality felt homburgs and fedoras had not been worn by businessmen to protect their heads, but because it was accepted that You Wore A Hat - it was fashion, not function, and although everyone likes function-related arguments for fashion changes, there is generally little evidence for them. If men had continued to wear fashionable hats, car manufacturers would likely have continued to leave enough headroom for them.

Really, you also have to take into account the fact that the dominant ethos over the twentieth century, except in certain subcultures, not only prioritized convenience but treated it as the most ""natural"" and rational reason behind just about everything. Wearing fewer clothes with simpler closures and a looser fit and cutting down on accessories was part of that, as was the increase in canned or packaged foods, greater amounts of disposable goods and tools, etc. I don't want to get too far outside my field here, but just as the phasing out of the hat is part of a wider change in fashion, the change in fashion is itself part of a wider cultural shift.

My go-to source on the overall casualization of dress in the twentieth century is *Dress Casual: How College Students Redefined American Style*, by Dierdre Clemente; if you're interested in the subject, you may want to find a copy of the book."

AskHistorians,"Sudden infant death syndrome, otherwise known as SIDS, sometimes called ""cradle death,"" is the unexplained death of a seemingly healthy baby anywhere from birth to one year of age, typically in their sleep. Before the modern age, what did people think was happening when this phenomenon occurred?","It's not necesarrily easy to determine, as SIDS is a complex syndrome that we don't even fully understand today. it's a diagnosis of exclusion - when doctors cannot find any other reason for the child to have died, it is SIDS. 

That makes it harder to look at the symptoms in the past and match them up to the modern world as we would with other illnesses such as TB or cancer. 

What we do see in history though is something called ""overlaying"" which was basically thought of as accidental (or not accidental) suffocation of the baby in the night by the parent. 

&#x200B;

> Many SIDS histories start with a reference to a case in the Old Testament of the Bible: *“And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it”* (1st Kings chapter 3: verse 19; King James version translation) as evidence that unexpected deaths of sleeping neonates, possibly representing examples of “SIDS”, occurred in antiquity. This is often reinforced by references discussing anecdotal examples of overlaying and accidental smothering from ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, European middle ages, Renaissance Europe, late modern period Europe, colonial America, and the American old south 

Infanticide was thought of as an issue as well. The church was concerned with differentiating between these accidental and purposeful child deaths. In 18th century Florence we see a device called an  arcuccio which was a wood and iron kind of cage to place over a sleeping infant to prevent the sleeping mother or wet nurse from rolling over and crushing the baby. 

In the 1800s England passes laws requiring the compulsary recording of all deaths, in 1887 they make it a requirement to note  if it was natural or unnatural.  

>Shortly after this, one of the more detailed historically important studies related to overlaying was published in 1893 in the *Edinburgh Medical Journal* by Charles Templeman ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474527/#bibr7-2017.017)). He reported that 399 infants were found dead in bed with parents in Dundee from 1882 to 1891. While a number of SIDS histories have noted that his pathological and epidemiological findings are similar to those of SIDS ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474527/#bibr2-2017.017), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474527/#bibr5-2017.017)), Templeman attributed these deaths to parental drunkenness and ignorant, careless mothers and he suggested that it become mandatory for infants to sleep separately from parents ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474527/#bibr7-2017.017)).

So while there likely were accidental suffocations, as babies start to sleep in cribs they noticed that the number of deaths were not going down. Thus overlaying and smothering lost credibility. 

So the ancient peoples of the world just thought the babies were being crushed or smothered while in bed with the mother for the most part. 

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474527/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474527/) is an excellent overview of the history of SIDS, and really gets into how they started to get closer to the truth, largely by proving it \_wasnt\_ other things."

AskHistorians,Did Japanese citizens get their homes back when they were released from US concentration camps?,"I hope it is not too far off topic if I respond to this by discussing the parallel situation in Canada. I know OP is interested in the US but this might be valuable context at least.

When World War II broke out there was a pretty sizable population of Japanese Canadians living in British Columbia, and the federal government (despite advice to the contrary from DND and the RCMP) was concerned that they would threaten the security of Pacific maritime operations.

One of the biggest concerns was that the majority of Canadian fishing vessels on the Pacific were owned by Japanese Canadians. About 18,000 boats were siezed. 

In 1942, the government decided to remove Japanese Canadians from coastal areas. Those who owned houses or farms also had them seized by the government. About 23,000 Japanese Canadians,  half of them natural-born Canadians, were relocated from the coast to inland areas.  Most were placed into internment camps in the interior of BC. Others were sent to the pairie provinces to work on farms.

Their property was sold or auctioned off, often at far less than its real value. The proceeds of the sales were used to pay for the operation of the internment camps and the expense of forced relocations.

After the war, internees were either relocated to other provences or deported to Japan. Canadians of Japanese decent were not permitted to live on the West Coast again until 1949. 

No Japanese Canadian was ever charged with espionage, sabotage or any other form of disloyalty.

No reparations or compensation was paid until 1988, when the Mulrony government made a formal apology and agreed to a settlement that paid $21,000 to each person directly affected.

That's why we have safety regulations and building codes.  The National Electrical Code first moved to incorporate Ground Fault Control Interrupters in 1968 -- that's those little switches that you see on sockets that pop out when there's a short.  Basically, the GFCI can tell when there's a direct path to ground and it breaks the circuit rather than letting current flow. 

Those outlets were first required outside around water -- like near swimming pools -- but have gradually proliferated into other areas in which we might expect water and electricity near each other.  Why?  Because water can create a quick, but fundamentally mobile path to ground, making anyone in the water part of the circuit.  

But back to toasters.  Why toasters specifically?  The history of electrification is an interesting one but it was lighting more than anything else that drove it.  Indeed, the so-called ""Edison Socket"" -- the one that you probably think of as a ""light socket"" -- was the ubiquitous power socket of early electrification.  There were no wall plugs -- [the wall plug as we think of it today wasn't even patented until 1904](https://connecticuthistory.org/first-us-detachable-electric-plug-today-in-history-november-8/) -- twenty years after [first commercial power plant spun up in the United States](https://edisontechcenter.org/NYC.html). 

All of that is to say that there was a time after the invention of the electric light but before the ubiquity of the electric appliance where such appliances were rare and simple.  The toaster occupies that intersection -- it is simple (just a wire through which current passes), small, and, arrives early on the scene of electrification.  

The first toasters -- made around 1905 -- were [little more then an open coil of wire that you screwed into a light socket.](https://www.johndesmond.com/blog/products/the-history-of-toasters/)  

From a safety standpoint, these things are nightmares.  The wires are exposed; there's no circuit breaker; there's not even an off switch.  I don't know if there are records of deaths or injuries but there were bound to be a lot of them; they were accidents waiting to happen.

But critically, they were attached to a cord and man portable in a way that very few other electrical appliances would be for some time. Washing machines, dryers, and other appliances would follow, but the toaster was small by necessity and early on the scene by virtue of simplicity: an ideal opportunity for an early 20th century suicide. 

And, of course, people knew that electricity could be dangerous.  Thomas Edison famously invented the electric chair; the first executions with it were more than a decade in the past when the first toasters hit store shelves.  Heck, [a power company even killed an elephant with AC current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoKi4coyFw0) as a publicity stunt. (Not a demonstration in the ""current wars"" as this comment previously indicated. Thanks to u/NetworkLama for the correction).

This then provides the basis for the concept -- motive, means, and opportunity, as it were.

Of course, sense then we've worked hard to prevent it.  GFCI outlets, circuit breakers, even short cords on toasters all conspire to make it considerably harder to harm yourself with one on purpose or otherwise."
AskHistorians,Did telegraph slang ever develop similar to internet and texting slang? Do any terms from telegraphs remain today?,"I can say a little about linguistic features introduced by use of Morse code. Another possible area of discussion is so-called *telegraphese*, the terse style used in telegrams, which perhaps someone else can address.

Telegraphy (whether wired or wireless) used Morse code, in which each character is represented by a sequence of 1 to 5 long or short pulses (in International Morse Code, anyway). The timings of the pulses and the intervals between the pulses are very important and inexperienced operators inevitably made mistakes.

The error-ridden Morse of inexperienced operators was called ""Hog-Morse"" because of the ease by which *home* (.... --- -- .) was miskeyed as *hog* (.... --- --.) by failing to leave the correct interval. So the name, how a Morse noob would key *home morse*, refers to both a common error and to the idea of a person who'd learned Morse at home; i.e., an amateur. There were systematic, decodable Hog-Morse errors that we might compare to autocorrect or some features of leet/1337 that rely on systematic mispellings/miskeyings (*pwn* for *own*, *turrent* for *turret*, mixing *1* and *!* to simulate inconsistent use of the shift key, etc.).

The main surviving source on Hog-Morse is an article by L.C. Hall in the January 1902 issue of *McClure's Magazine* entitled ""Telegraph Talk and Talkers: Human Character and Emotions, an Old Telegrapher Reads on the Wire."" Hall suggests Hog-Morse's porcine association is the origin of the term *ham* which is now how amateur radio operators self-identify. (Note there are numerous proposed etymologies for the term; possibly it's related to *ham actor* whose etymology is also unclear.)

By its nature, Hog-Morse would really only be of interest to Morse savants themselves. In addition, many of Hall's examples are now hard to understand because they are from American Morse Code, not International Morse Code. (American Morse Code had *three* pulse durations so was even easier to mess up.)

In addition, there are a very few phrases from Morse code that have entered common parlance. Initially they were keyed, then because they had become commonly understood they were simply spoken out. The example everybody knows is *SOS* (... --- ...) for when you are in distress and need help. Maybe ordinary people also know *CQ* (-.-. --.-) for when you are looking for someone (or maybe this is too obscure).

Another example is saying *roger* for ""got it; understood."" This originated from sending *R* (.-.) as a quick acknowledgment of a message indicating it had been received and understood. When voice communications became common, *R* was expanded to *roger*."
AskHistorians,What kind of insurance policy did the World Trade Center (Twin Towers) have?,"As soon as the day after the attacks,^1 the New York Times [reported on](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/12/business/day-terror-insurers-reinsurance-companies-wait-sort-cost-damages.html) the ""dozens of insurers"" that would be sorting out the damages. It said the effort would take years, and sure enough, it did.

The primary representative of the consortium that owned the WTC complex was real estate mogul Larry Silverstein. He signed a 99-year lease on July 24, 2001. Like most new owners of real estate, he also signed an insurance policy right around the same time. When the towers fell a couple of months later, that insurance policy became the focus of a years-long legal proceeding.

Most homeowners' policies don't cover terrorism, but it's not uncommon in commercial policies. (Actually, the [Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002](https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-terrorism-risk-and-insurance) makes it hard to *avoid* terrorism coverage in most policies today.) The WTC policy in particular would obviously have terrorism coverage, given that the 1993 bombing had [a major insurance impact](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/nyregion/crisis-twin-towers-port-authority-complex-insurance-issues-aftermath-explosion.html). So when Silverstein went to collect for 9/11, the only question was: was the loss technically [one ""qualifying event,"" or two](https://www.forbes.com/2003/07/23/cx_da_0723topnews.html?sh=262da2fd7675)? Ultimately, the insurance payout was [$4.6 billion](https://gothamist.com/news/wtc-insurance-payout-totals-455-billion) - which took until 2007 to sort out.

But that wasn't the end of it. Silverstein [sued the insurers again](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/nyregion/27rebuild.html) in 2008, won $1.2B in 2010 from American Airlines and United...on and on we go. Finally, in 2018, [the last lawsuit was settled](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sept11-insurance/world-trade-center-developer-loses-final-9-11-lawsuit-against-insurer-idUSKBN1KN2OL) - *against* Silverstein. None of this is personally enriching him, though - all of these awards have gone into the rebuilding of the WTC complex, including the famous ""Freedom Tower"" (the new 1 WTC).

The whole thing is all quite messy. You can find scholarly articles about the 9/11 insurance situation in [Tort and Insurance Law Journal](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25763575), the [Journal of Risk and Insurance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1539-6975.2007.00247.x), etc. It has [permanently transformed](https://www.forbes.com/2005/07/12/terrorism-insurance-security-cz_jl_0712opinion.html?sh=ad8f4ab195ba) the way commercial insurance policies work.

^1 - [This Snopes article](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wtc-terrorism-insurance/) cites an insurance-related story by Reuters from September 11 itself, but the only version of that story I can find online is a Fox News repost from 2015, so I went with the NYT 9/12 source.

AskHistorians,"Richard Feynman had a ""priority 2"" designation when he flew from Los Alamos to Oak Ridge during the Manhattan Project. What was this ""priority"" system the US appeared to use?","Casual air travel, as we know it now, was almost entire stopped during the World War 2 to conserve critical resources to the war effort.

The priority system was put in place to ensure only those serving the war effort flew. ^1

The system was part of the wartime mobilization plan created by the Air Transport Association's Edgar Gorrell in 1937.  The plan ensured the airline industry immediately began coordinating with the military on issues of transporting aircraft, cargo and personnel in support of the war. ^2

The Industrial War Plans Section, under the direct supervision of the Chief of the Material Division, was responsible for ""adequate provision for essential wartime needs in the mobilization of Air Corps material and industrial organization."" ^3 The plan editions from 1930 onward were blueprints for wartime civilian control and direction of the nation's resources.

The U.S. had been forced to address the issue of conflicting priorities during WWI. The War Industries Board was established in 1917 by President Woodrow Wilson to coordinate purchasing priorities by the agencies of the Army and Navy. Internal logistical consolidation inside the War Department finally led to a centralized determination of priorities that would then be presented to the board. With the political consensus granted after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the new office of the War Production Board was established and given the authority to enforce its policies through granting priorities and allocating resources. ^3 ^4

The Manhattan Project is usually cited as one of the best examples of the prioritization system as it was able to accomplish its wartime objectives with minimum hardship and dislocation.

AskHistorians,Mike Duncan's Revolutions podcast is ending. Any reviews?,"My expertise is in common law and history of taxation in common law so I do have a fairly good acquaintance with the English Civil Wars, Commonwealth England, the Glorious Revolution, etc., and the first season of Revolutions was done pretty damn well for a short podcast series on a very complex series of events. Duncan even cited some primary sources pretty dear to my heart re: a side piece of my scholarly writings that’s been brewing on the sidelines for nearly a decade, which was pretty endearing and neat.

I’m not an expert on e.g. the French Revolution (of 1789) or the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917 but as a lay listener who is nevertheless a fan, I really enjoyed them, and he treats the multitudinous political ideologies present in Russia at the turn of the 20th century with more care and precision than I can recall in any media aimed at the general public/history enthusiasts.

Basically, a long-winded way of saying that he’s not perfect—because of course he isn’t, aiming to cover so much ground—but he’s pretty damn good and, above all, eminently entertaining. I’ve not heard the recent appendices but from the first few they seem to be less rigorous but intentionally so with all the disclaimers floating about. Definitely a recommendation for good history podcasting.

EDIT: Most of his interpretations are generally accepted, though there are a few choices he makes that clay be subject to disagreement. I can’t recall a very specific example since it’s been a bit since I listened to the first season, but  something like dating the end of the French Revolution (1789) is always arguable but a continuum anyway, so anyone who doesn’t baselessly say something like “1791!” and can support their reasoning is on fairly solid ground. He is pretty good on disclaimers when he’s making such choices if I recall correctly."

AskHistorians,How arbitrary could a medieval king actually afford to be?,"This is a difficult question to tackle. One reason for that is that the Medieval period was very long and political theory and practice changed wildly during the era, and was quite different in different places. Kingship in 9th century England was vastly different from kingship in 14th century France, for example. I'll provide a bit of a bird's eye view of the nature of Medieval kingship--just note that I am mostly trained in English history, so my answer will have that orientation.

That said, it is true that medieval kings had a great deal of power, but their ability to exercise that power in arbitrary ways was limited. Medieval kings relied on the support of the landholding nobles whose support enabled their position of power in the first place. These nobles had their own interests and agendas, and would not tolerate a king who acted in ways that threatened those interests. If a king were to execute a cook for a minor mistake, it would likely be seen as a sign of unnecessary cruelty that could make his nobles question his fitness to rule. And, well, once your nobles question your right to rule, you're not going to be on the throne for long! Medieval kings were bound by laws and customs that restricted their actions. 

An example of a medieval king overextending his authority is King John  (reigned 1199 to 1216). The most significant instance of King John overextending his authority was his conflict with the Church over the appointment of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1207, John attempted to install his own candidate for the position, but Pope Innocent III refused to recognize the appointment and excommunicated John. This conflict led to a political crisis in England, with many of the nobles and bishops turning against John and supporting the Pope. In 1215, a group of barons and bishops forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, which limited his power and enforced the idea that even the king was subject to the law.

Later in the medieval period, we have an example that I think might be kind of the prototype for the stereotype of medieval kingship that I think your question relies upon: King Richard II of England, (reigned 1377 to 1399). King Richard II was known for his capricious and unpredictable behavior, which often led to conflicts with his advisors, nobles, and even his own family members. In 1387, he launched a campaign against a group of nobles who had criticized his policies and challenged his authority. Known as the ""Merciless Parliament,"" this session of the English Parliament saw Richard purge his political opponents from positions of power and authority. Richard accused several of his critics, including the powerful Duke of Gloucester, of treason and had them arrested and imprisoned. He then summoned a new parliament, which he packed with his supporters and used to pass a series of laws that strengthened his control over the country. This caused backlash among the nobles and the general public, who saw him as a tyrant and a threat to their liberties. In 1399, Richard was deposed by his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, who went on to become King Henry IV. Richard was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he died under \*ahem\* mysterious circumstances.

So, while medieval kings did have a great deal of power, their ability to act arbitrarily was often checked by other political forces--often the Catholic Church, and often by the nobles whose support the kings relied upon (indeed, oftentimes, dukes held much more de facto power than the kings to whom they were subject). While they might be able to get away with some minor abuses of power, such as punishing a cook or making a frivolous decree, they would risk alienating their powerful supporters and their subjects if they acted in ways that were seen as unjust or arbitrary.

I'm sorry this is a somewhat vague answer. Like I said, the medieval period was quite long, and many parts of the world are included when we think about this period."

AskHistorians,"In large parts of Chinese history, China has been united but then it falls and fractures again. So were the several rises and falls of disparate Chinese dynasties one continuous state evolution or can they be treated as rise of different empires just happening to lie in the same geographical region?","So, there are any number of perspectives on this, but to lay out my *own* position, informed by my familiarity primarily with Qing scholarship, it is better to conceive of imperial China as comprising a contiguous set of political traditions claimed by a variety of non-consecutive states, rather than as a singular polity whose mantle passed between ruling families.

The first and most obvious case to consider is, what happens when there is more than one empire at the same time? Because to be quite frank, there has almost never been a Chinese empire where power simply passed from one ruling house to another at the top. 'Civil' wars, or perhaps more accurately wars of imperial competition, were the norm rather than the exception; virtually never was there a peaceful transition of power between dynastic houses. Perhaps the only notable exception would be the Sima clan's usurpation of the state of Wei from the Cao family to found the state of Jin in 265 CE; even that was, however, effectively a bloodless coup coming at the tail end of a major civil war within Wei. Even seemingly 'clean' transitions involved the foundation of a new state outright, but new states didn't necessarily emerge with ambitions of assuming hegemonic status. For instance, the state of Latter Jin was founded in 1618 and refounded as the Great Qing in 1636, but we don't really know exactly when it began seriously intending to conquer the lands of the Ming Empire. For its part, the Ming Empire never assumed the full territorial scope of the Yuan, which in any event *did not simply end in 1368*. The Northern Yuan continued, albeit in an increasingly ceremonial capacity, until the surrender of Lighdan Khan to the Jurchens in 1634.

To give an example of how empires overlapped temporally, the Qing conquest of the former Ming Empire actually serves as quite a good example. The Great Qing was, as noted above, founded in 1636. But at this juncture it only ruled over Manchuria, and not China proper. Its first permanent control of China proper came in 1644, when a rebel army besieged and captured Beijing, leading in turn to Qing forces being invited into China by Ming a frontier general, Wu Sangui, who defected to the Manchus. But if 1644 did not mark the beginning of the Qing Empire itself, neither did it mark the start of total Qing control of China: the completion of conquest was still more than a decade away. Nor did it mark the end of the Ming Empire, as branch lines of the Zhu clan declared a continued Ming Empire in southern China. The Qing would not stamp these remnants out in continental Asia until 1662, but that same year loyalist elements expelled the Dutch from Taiwan, leaving a Ming remnant across the strait. Formal control over southern China was delegated to three 'feudatory' states after 1655, but abolished in 1681 the wake of a revolt by these feudatories in the 1670s. Not until 1683 would the Ming loyalist remnants on Taiwan be stamped out. 

So, if we were to use the 'continuous empire' model, at which of these junctures do we consider the Ming to have ended and the Qing to have begun?

* 1636? But the Qing had yet to conquer *any* of China, which was still in Ming hands, however tenuously.
* 1644? But there was still a Ming emperor (well, at least three competing ones) ruling over territory the Qing didn't yet control. Moreover, there was the rival Shun Empire, founded by the rebels who had dethroned the core Ming line that year.
* 1662? But the Qing had yet to administratively integrate the south, nor deal with the last Ming remnants.
* 1683? But this is just the reverse of the 1636 case – the Ming remnants on Taiwan hadn't meaningfully contested Qing rule over China anyway.

The answer is that it is a trick question. We should not use the 'continuous empire' model. That being said, imperial transitions still did happen at the *local* level. We *can* give dates for when one region passed from one empire to another. For instance, if you were to visit a museum on Taiwan today, typically Ming reign dates are used up to the Qing conquest *of Taiwan* in 1683, rather than switching over in 1644 per the traditional, arbitrary chronology which uses the capture of Beijing as the transitional point. As far as the modern Taiwanese are concerned, the Ming-Qing transition, in chronological terms, is marked in terms of a *local* transition of power, not an abstract shift in the rulership of 'China'. And how would we speak of regions that were not consistently part of a 'canonical' empire? Is the history of Xinjiang part of Chinese history in general, or just between 60-220, 640-763, and from 1757 onward? Is the history of Yunnan 'Chinese' history, or only after 1253?

The 'continuous empire' model breaks down further in scenarios where the 'new' state didn't actually manage to fully 'unite' China, however defined. We have seen how the Ming didn't actually conquer the Yuan outright, just displace it from China proper. Going back in time, the Song Empire, which united most of China by 960, failed to conquer what are now Hebei and Liaodong from the Khitan-ruled Great Liao, but despite the relatively limited territory the Liao held, this was enough to be a substantial hamper to Song prestige claims. This was further compounded when the Jurchen-ruled Jin state defeated the Liao and then conquered China up to the Huai River. So, who is 'China' in this instance? Classically, the traditional timeline of succession regards the Song as the legitimate successor to the Tang and completely sidelines the Liao and Jin, but that designation is completely arbitrary.

But not only did these periods represent a time of political division, there's also a strong case to be made that prolonged non-Han rule in the north was beginning to cause an ethnographic divide. The Song, Liao, and Jin all had somewhat different language to describe their own Sinitic subjects versus those in their rival state, and this administrative division may – though we do not know with certainty – have had effects on self-identification. This division continued under the Yuan, who designated people as *Hanren* or *Songren* depending on whether they or their male-line ancestors were subjects of the Jin or the Song at the time of conquest. Had the eventual Red Turban revolt that established the Ming failed to push far enough north, or had the emperor they installed been less totalising in his intent to 'de-Mongolify' China following his victory, we may well have ended up with a permanent bifurcation of the Han Chinese into two separate population groups, which may conceivably have ended up with divergent histories of statehood. The assertion of Song legitimacy is one that really only makes sense from the retrospective view of the unified rule of China by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Empires, and the consolidation of China proper as both a geographical and a demographic space under the latter two.

Even then, relics of that political division survive in modern English. The term 'Cathay', which derives from 'Khitai', originally referred specifically to *northern* China, i.e. the former Jin lands, while 'China', coined by Marco Polo, referred solely to the south that had been ruled by the Song. While near-synonymous today, there was nevertheless a time when European outsiders, based on accurate information about China's administration under the Yuan, regarded the north-south division as a natural one, temporarily bridged by Mongolian imperialism. Such north-south divides threatened to recur afterward, especially under the Qing: the Three Feudatories revolt of the 1670s, the Taiping War in the 1850s-60s, and the 1911 Revolution, all threatened to once again split China between a Han-ruled south and a non-Han-ruled north, should neither side have succeeded in achieving total victory.

Finally we just need to talk about the nomenclature here. There is no Chinese word that maps onto the same variety of meanings encompassed by the English word 'China'; or, to put it another way, the English word 'China' is used to encompass a variety of meanings that exist as individual terms in Chinese, if they even do at all. Paradoxically, this flexibility is at times deliberately reabsorbed and appropriated by the more nationalistic strand of Chinese historians to argue that if a particular empire had *a* concept of a 'China' in some way, that it must therefore have been the *same* concept of China as used today. But even the term *Zhongguo* 中國, the closest analogue to 'China' that exists in Chinese, has had a variety of meanings over time. When first coined in the Warring States period, it was a plural meaning 'the central state**s**' that referred to the collective of the states that nominally recognised Zhou hegemony, or it was used in the singular to refer specifically to the Zhou as the nominal hegemon. Sometimes it was used to refer to a space defined by cultural cachet, at others to state boundaries. The Ming would use *Zhongguo* to denote a geographical region that we might term 'China proper', while excluding their outer imperial holdings, but the Qing used it more generally to refer to all of the territory under their rule. These are all different uses of the term *Zhongguo*, and its reuse over time is not in itself fundamentally convincing as to state continuity, especially when not all states agreed on what territory the term encompassed. Indeed, one thing to note is that the use of *Zhongguo* to describe the whole territory of a state may well be a Manchu calque: *dulimba-i gurun*, 'central polity', is a term with distinct Khitan and Jurchen precedents, and may have influenced *Zhongguo* rather than the other way around. Moreover, that these states did *not* simply reuse a shared term for their own territorial scope is indicative of the genuine notion that these were different empires. Empires with some shared political traditions, and overlapping territory, but nevertheless different."
AskHistorians,"Floating Feature: Workers of the World, Unite","A much forgotten part of the Titanic event is her short life being bookended by labor strikes - strikes that would have changed history and strikes that did change history.

In 1912, the UK coal miners union went on their first strike - demanding minimum wage protections. This national strike was the culmination of almost two decades of building tension, with the union finally grinding the country to a halt.

The miners were accused of ""blackmailing the nation"" in the press, but they held fast and as the strike hit the one month mark - coal became more scarce and more precious.

On April 2nd, as Titanic began her sea trials, the rest of the shipping world was at a standstill. Ships were bought back to port and docked/put out of service. Trips were cancelled or rescheduled, and dry docks were booked and filled with companies using the non-sailing time to catch up on repairs. 

This was not possible for Olympic, who was one day away from beginning round trip to New York. White Star decided, no doubt to annoyed customers, that neither Olympic nor the soon to sail Titanic would be attempting to reach their top speeds, thereby making the week-long crossing longer than normal. This in an effort to preserve as much fuel as possible.

A tiny, maybe inconsequential adjustment, but the situation was that dire. The day before she sailed, Olympic's crew found every scrap and crumb of coal they could and stocked her third class dining room full with it - insurance to make sure they could make it home and whatever possible came after. On that trip, third class meals had to be taken elsewhere.

On April 6th, the strike broke, and Titanic was to go ahead. This was a close shave, as her maiden voyage had already been delayed a month and the publicity would be brutal. However, it was not possible for the newly started coal mines to stock her for her sailing day only 4 days later.

Whatever was left over from Olympic was hauled onto Titanic and then, White Star Line was forced to dock 6 ships as all their coal was needed to fuel this behemoth of a liner. Passengers on those newly docked ships were transferred to Titanic- an incredibly lucky turn of events for them.

Meanwhile, all the out of work ship workers clamored for a job crewing Titanic. Most of Southampton worked in shipping and the sudden freeze had devastated their economy. What was once 7 opportunities for work was now down to one, on the biggest, most famous ship in the world. The unions fought hard for their members to be prioritized for this most desperately needed job.

By the skin of her teeth, Titanic set off on April 10th and....well, you know the rest.

Olympic slipped back into Southampton a few days after the sinking, quietly preparing to turn around and head back to New York- an attempt to continue business as normal. As a knee jerk response, WSL stocked her full of as many lifeboats as they could find. On April 24th, 20 minutes before she was due to set off, Olympic's entire crew voted to go on strike.

It was not at all possible to stock Olympic with high quality, tested, boats in 9 days. It just could not be done. The boats White Star provided were old, rotting, falling apart, leaking and came with only four extra crewman to assist working the 30-ish of them. This was not even close to reassuring the crew watching the entire city grieve the many, many locals who had been horrendously lost.

White Star tried everything. They threatened mutiny charges, heavy fines, jail - but it was useless. The public was firmly on the side of the strikers, and WSL could not survive with the image of punishing those who refused to set out under the same circumstances as what had just shocked the world. They even tried to circumnavigate the union, but could only find a few non-union men willing to sign up. Those that did sign up, found passengers walking off - none of them wanting to sail with an inexperienced crew. This snowballed, leading to more passengers walking off or rebooking, and while there was a good hearted/possibly half-serious-in-a-jokey-way offering by passengers to do the work, no actual solution was in sight.

By now, the strikers had pushed their luck and began to fracture. The firemen, specifically, wanted all non union workers fired before any one of them would come on. Eventually, WSL's threats were carried through and the strikers found themselves arrested on mutiny charges.

A bad move by White Star? Not at all. To their surprise, the jailed workers found their union advocating against them, telling them to get to work. The city of Southampton all turned on them - they needed ships to sail. Ships kept the entire city employed, fed, watered, and taken care of. The economy was collapsing and people needed to work. Some of the demands of the strikers had become ludicrous, impossible, completely unpractical. 

And yet, incredibly, the strikers called the bluff of WSL, the union, and the entire city of Southampton. They refused to budge. Olympic's voyage was cancelled and her passengers were booked on other ships at WSL's expense, the deepest insult coming from being forced to book them on rival Cunarders.

When hauled into court, the strikers found themselves punished with nothing. They gambled correctly, holding out until the very point where the city both wanted them to get to work but would not blame them for not working. It was a risky and precarious moment, but they pulled it off.

Olympic did set sail eventually, with her all union crew. The fireman were lead by Fred Barrett - who'd just been rescued from Titanic.

So, you see, Titanic's story could and would have been massively different if not for the efforts of unions. Had the strike ended any later, Titanic most likely would not have sailed, but instead she was able to set off on time by incredible luck and timing. A small delay would have changed everything.

Post sinking- regulations were going to change, but had it not been for such a stubborn (sometimes ridiculously) crew, who pushed an entire city to it's breaking point and shut shipping down- it's quite feasible that the bureaucracy that couldn't keep up before Titanic sailed, would have been just as slow in responding to her. As it happened, it was union workers digging in their heels which accelerated the legislation for safety at sea - the same ones we are still using today."

AskHistorians,How do I know history is true?,"Congratulations, you've achieved the realisation you're supposed to have in learning the historical method! Just like restaurant back of house has to deal with fire and sharp objects, history has to deal with the possibility that everyone is lying.

AskHistorians,What did J.R.R. Tolkien's family think of Dungeons and Dragons? Did they ever consider legal action over D&D's 'borrowings'?,"My MA Thesis was actually about the evolution of gaming culture in the 20th century, so I will definitely comment on this.

The Company that had Tolkien's holdings and his estate definitely took TSR to task over the things that they ""borrowed"" early on in the life of the game. And TSR took quite a lot, but arguably not as much from Tolkien than other sources. It's somewhat hard to understand the nuance these days, but Gygax and Arneson were not major fans of LoTR or Tolkien. Gygax in particular wasn't a huge fan.

Instead of LoTR, Gygax especially was more interested in emulating a sub-genre of fantasy called Sword and Sorcery. Stories from the genre that the modern person would be most familiar with would be Conan the Barbarian. Jack Vance's Dying Earth series is where spell casting in D&D comes from, hence why everyone refers to the memorize it and forget it spell slot system as ""Vancian"" magic. Sword and Sorcery tales are all about barbarians, magic is rare and incredibly deadly, cutthroats, bandits, and kings, ancient temples and mysterious locations. Early D&D especially is a amalgamation of all these ideas.

Even if it wasn't his idea however, Gygax still had friends that were interested in the heroic, High Fantasy of LoTR. So, like any Dungeon Master that is worth his salt, elements from LoTR were included to appease that section of his player base. LoTR was, even then, a big deal. It was going to have some kind of influence on the game.

The early years of TSR, the company that was founded to publish the game, and eventually several other board games, were interesting. D&D grew out of wargaming, which in of itself was a niche hobby that few paid attention to. Anything creative is derivative, in some sense of the word. This is true for Dungeons and Dragons. It took a large amount, and spun it in its own fashion.

It's rather interesting that perhaps the source that the game arguably took the least from were the ones that sued TSR first. Essentially, the lawsuit in the early 70s before the publication of Advance Dungeons and Dragons when the game was still in its ""Original"" Dungeons and Dragons format was nomenclature. Thus, TSR stopped using the words Ents, Hobbits, and Balrog, changing them to Treants, Halflings and Balor. Honestly, I think Elves were left untouched because its not something that is trademarkable, and Elves in D&D have more to do with the myths that inspired them, and perhaps Michael Moorcock's books, than their depiction in LoTR.

For a game that seemingly ""ripped"" off everything, TSR would become a very litigious company. Still, in these early days, that was not the case. Even after this lawsuit with Tolkien's estate, Gary Gygax and TSR acted like no one was giving any mind to what they were doing. The attitude seemed to be that no one is paying attention to our little dragon game, so we can do what we want. A major lawsuit would come in 1979, when Arneson sued sued Gygax because of the publication of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. Arneson was contending that he deserved credit and royalties for the new iteration of the game, and was directly a result of Gygax not wanting to pay him royalties.

This attitude also changed when TSR published *Deities and Demigods* for AD&D in 1980. The downfall for that book was publishing statistics for the gods from Lovecraft's mythos, it was claimed they had received permission, but another game company already had those rights, Chaosium and their game *Call of Cthulhu.* They eventually settled out of court, all publication of the books were fixed to remove the offending material, and the first edition of *Deities and Demigods* has become a very expensive collectors item.

Still, these events are important. It shows that people had started paying attention to Gary and his little fairy game. It also set the scene for the cutthroat, lawsuit filled world that would become the RPG industry of the 1980's and 1990's.

So, to sum it up, the lawsuit from Tolkien's estate is not particularly unique. Especially considering what was to come.

One final note of irony, and an example of how cutthroat the RPG industry was in those decades. Gary Gygax was forced out of the company he founded in 1985. He spent his time in the RPG business after this doing some minor things. In particular, he attempted to publish a game called *Dangerous Journeys,* for a company called GDW, which published another big RPG, a space opera game called *Traveller.* It's publication was blocked by a lawsuit from TSR, for ""being too derivative of the AD&D game.""

TSR had very few friends in its last decade of life.

Note: It's worth noting that there is some debate about authorship, what ""really"" happened and so on in early D&D. Specifically, there seems to be two camps that are fighting, those that say that Dave Arneson did more than is commonly accepted, and those that say most of early D&D was Gary Gygax's endeavors. Look up the documentary *Secrets of Blackmoor* to get the perspectives of those in the first camp, but this post in particular has little to do with this squabble."

AskHistorians,"In the western world, we think of the time around 2500 years ago as part of the age of antiquity. For anyone living back then, it was their modern era. Did people living in Greece or Rome during this time have their equivalent, what they considered an age of antiquity?","Classical chronology was never an exact science. 

During the Classical period, infamously, almost every Greek city had its own dating system, just as it had its own calendar and laws. In Athens, for example, an official called the eponymous archon gave his name to the year. At Sparta, the year was named after one of the ephors. At Argos, the priestess of Hera had that honor. 

The dizzying array of dating conventions created enormous headaches for ancient Greek historians, who had to either pick a single dating system, like the Athenian archon lists, or craft cumbersome synchronisms. It was possible, however, to build long-term chronologies. Perhaps the most famous example is the Parian Marble, an inscribed chronicle recording events from 1582 to 298 BC.

The best-known Greek attempt at a systematic chronology was the Olympiad system, pioneered by the historian Timaeus and systematized by the polymath Eratosthenes in the third century BC. This system dated events in relation to the Olympic Games, which had been held every four years since – by Eratosthenes’ calculation – our 776 BC. An event that took place in 480 BC was thus in the year of the 75th Olympiad. The Olympiad system was useful for historians, but it never became standard like the modern AD/CE system – and it seems to have never been referenced in daily life. 

Like the Greeks, the Romans typically dated years by annual magistrates – in their case, the two ordinary consuls, who took office – by the imperial era – on January 1. Consular dating remained standard throughout Roman history. Roman scholars, however, sometimes referenced what we call “ab urbe condita” dates, counting the years since the foundation of Rome. There was never a definitive date (then as now, historians disagreed about such things), but most scholars thought that Rome had been founded around 750 BC. The date calculated by the polymath Varro, 753 BC, was the most widely accepted.   


Like the Olympiad system, however, dating from the foundation of Rome was a convention used more or less exclusively by historians. 

In other words, there really wasn't a clear conception of ""antiquity"" in antiquity, since their conception of the past was less neatly defined than ours. (And our conception of the classical past, it should be noted, is exceptionally - perhaps overly - neat, conditioned by the AD system and by the Renaissance obsession with antiquity, both of which have shaped how we tend to teach ancient history.)

If there was a division in ancient conceptions of the past, it was marked by the Trojan War. Myth and history were never neatly disarticulated in the classical imagination, but the Trojan War marked the point of separation between a past that was (thought to be) known and a past that was acknowledged as all but unknown, save through the traditional narratives we call the myths. Most ancient authors seem to have believed that Hercules and Jason had indeed existed (whatever their thoughts about the received myths surrounding these heroes). But they imagined them, or at least tended to write about them, in different terms from such ""historical"" figures as Themistocles and Xerxes.

The antiquity of antiquity, in short, was the world of myth."
AskHistorians,What is the “lost subterraneous city” discovered in Siberia in 1784?,"Presumably, it comes from [this letter](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-07-02-0130), written by James Madison and sent to Thomas Jefferson on April 25th, 1784., as for the figures mentioned in the letter:

* ""Mazzei"" is Filippo Mazzei (1730-1816), an Italian doctor and merchant who had been friends with Jefferson and Madison for about a decade at this point.

* ""De Buffon"" is George-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788), a famed French natural scientist best known for being the author of the *Historie Naturelle*, a scientific encyclopedia, as well as director the Royal Gardens in Paris.

* The Empress of Russia mentioned is Catherine II (1729-1796), better known as Catherine the Great.

* The ""Monsr. Faujas de St. Fond"" is Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond (1741-1819), a French scientist who regularly collaborated with the Comte de Buffon and assisted in writing the *Historie Naturelle*.

* ""M.L., the son of Buffon"" is George-Louis Marie Leclerc de Buffon (1764-1794), who notably bucked his father's desires to follow him as head of the Royal Gardens and became a military officer.

It should be noted that the story went through a game of telephone: a Russian archaeological site found various artifacts, including an equestrian statue (note how the Jefferson letter doesn't specify ""giant"") with a large, elaborate gold chain. Part or all of the chain is sent to the Imperial court in Saint Petersburg. Catherine has a sample sent to Comte de Buffon for his analysis. De Buffon shares his thoughts with Mazzei. Mazzei visits Madison and shares what he learned from de Buffon. Madison recounts what Mazzei told him in the letter. As a result, we know very little about the details of the original archaeological expedition. None of the Frenchmen mentioned in the letter participated in it, and they only knew what was in Catherine's letter. It's also worsened by Mazzei's failure to clarify details, such as the longitude of where the discovery took place. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/owZeiPC.png)'s an image illustrating the two different claims, with Buffon the younger's (62-64°) in red and Faujas's (72-74°) being in green.

If I could speak Russian, I could potentially research sources on 18th century Russian archaeological expeditions, but I can't. But we can make some educated guesses based on the region. Candidate cultures who produced or traded for this goldwork include the Saka (600s-200s BC), the Xiongnu (300s BC-10s AD), the Göktürks (500s-600s), the Kimek-Kipchaks (800s-1000s), and Cuman-Kipchaks (900s-1200s). As for the nature of the site, it could have been a *kurgan* (burial mound), an old temporary capital of a nomadic group, or a trading center (not too likely, seeing how it was likely very far north of the Silk Road). I highly doubt it was a full-blown ""subterranean city,"" though."

AskHistorians,"How can modern romanticism of Vineyards be explained, historically?","Oh! It's because it's an offshoot of pastoralist art.

Every few centuries pastoral art experiences a revival, usually when people/political power becomes concentrated in cities far away from rural areas and people start writing books about how romantic it would be if life were slower-paced. We see a similar sort of thing with homesteading now in fact. Like so many things, if we look at the target audience we can see why: it's aimed at urban populations who fundamentally misunderstand how difficult farming/sheep herding/country living is. 

Note: this is the same impulse that led Marie-Antoinette to dressing up as a milkmaid and building Le Petit Trianon so she could pretend to farm - it is also the same impulse that caused nobility in Austria-Hungary to suddenly - ahistorically btw - decide to put on dirndls studded with gems as a ""national dress"" when it had never been worn by the peasantry. One of my favourite things about pastoralism is how absolutely ridiculous it is as an art movement - in the 18th and 19th centuries for instance, it was very popular to have stomacher brooches made of diamonds that looked like elaborate floral bouquets - some of these jewels would have springs set behind them (this style was called *en tremblant*) so it looked like they were real flowers that were actually moving in the wind as people moved. Wealth used to be measured in how much land people had, but as economies changed and it became about money instead, people still romanticized the time when it was about land rather than material wealth by turning their money into things that symbolized country wealth - diamond flowers backed in gold. You can also see this very clearly in objets d'art, in paintings, in micromosaic boxes and so on - whenever there are loads of florals and vines or young women in diaphonous gowns dancing around meadows surrounded by sheep it's often an example of pastoralism.   

The first Greek novel that talks about this is an example of the pastoral genre - (Daphnis and Chloe) was written in the second century AD but really there are tons of examples of this kind of thinking from all sorts of time periods. While the word ""pastoral"" generally refers to herding sheep for example, the art form does encompass different aspects of ""country life"" so to speak - sometimes sheep or cow herding, farming or, as your post is about, vintners. Making wine is additionally seen as being particularly classical with the Roman and Greek associations and the cultic practices of Bacchus/Dionysos mysteries, so it also has the additional charm of being associated with classical antiquity in addition to being pastoral. 

It's quite obvious to anyone that isn't wealthy or royalty that rural life is hard and not nearly as romantic as it appears, but there's a certain wistful charm associated with people who don't have to practice hard manual labour - it's considered closer to an edenic/paradisal ideal where man lived in harmony with nature and represents a golden age of simplicity, before life became ""complicated.""  

Pastoralism is one of those perpetual art trends that seems to have more to do with the human condition and urbanisation than any particular time in history, as evidenced by the numerous cultures that embrace it throughout history. 

Now: why have vineyards retained this romanticisation when other agricultural industries have not? They are one of the only forms of modern agriculture that are not yet totally industrialized - many vineyards are small, with people personally picking grapes and enjoying the fruits (ha) of their labour in a way that is very satisfying. In contrast, e.g. factory farming (modern farming) is very difficult to romanticize and almost no one still herds sheep or cows in a way that makes this a present dream in the minds of modern people. It's why the modern equivalent to this kind of pastoralist romantic ideal is closer to homesteading or cottagecore. But having an operating a vineyard is one of the only ways to still practice a craft that is thousands of years old and makes you feel profoundly connected to the world and your history in a way that is possible to romanticize."
AskHistorians,Why did most civilizations shift from barley to wheat as their staple?,"The most important selection factor was geography. Our ancestors could only select those cereals that grew naturally in their geography.

Genetic analysis has established that there was a common ancestor of sorghum, rice, millet, maize, oats, wheat, barley and rye between 45–60 million years ago. Oats split off from a common branch about 25 million years ago and barley split off about 3–4 million years ago.


Of those grasses that grew naturally in their vicinity, our ancestors selected those having the largest seeds
having husks that could be removed more easily
producing the kind of bread they liked the best
There is also a hypothesis that some cereals were selected and cultivated for attracting wild game animals so they could be more easily hunted.

The earliest breads where made from millet and sorghum, not wheat.

However, wheat varieties have better baking characteristics than millet, sorghum, barley and oats and therefore wheat varieties were increasingly selected and grown for bread making and thus became a staple food for human consumption.

By contrast, barley and oats have poorer baking characteristics compared to wheat varieties and therefore barley and oats were predominantly selected and grown as food stock for domesticated grazing animals. Barley was also grown and selected for brewing beer.

Wheat has therefore become the primary staple grain for human consumption.

Over the last 10.000 years wheat varieties have been selected for better and better baking characteristics. The earliest wheat cultivar was Einkorn, ca. 9600 BCE, then Emmer (bronze age), then Dinkel, aka spelt (medieval age), and eventually modern common wheat. The latter two have the best baking characteristics, while Emmer has better baking characteristics than Einkorn.

Over the last 100 years, wheat has been selectively bred for yield. Modern hybrid wheats yield about three times as much grain (in weight) than barley, oats and rye. This has further shifted the balance towards wheat."

AskHistorians,When did hockey decide to punish players by putting them in a box?,"This is a good question, and one that is harder to answer than I expected.

The ""first""^1 indoor hockey game, played in Montreal on March 3, 1875, had a [summary written in local newspapers the next day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_indoor_ice_hockey_game#First_game), which notably did not mention any penalties or anything like that. Similarly, the 1877 McGill rules, the earliest codified rules for hockey ([seen here](https://icehockey.fandom.com/wiki/McGill_Rules)) do not mention anything about infractions either. The only related thing would be the last point: ""All disputes shall be settled by the Umpires, or in the event of their disagreement, by the Referee."" So those don't really help us out on anything.

However the first recorded book about hockey, *Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game* by Arthur Ferrell^2 (1899) does have a [page that goes over the rules of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hockey:_Canada%27s_Royal_Winter_Game/Chapter_V), which was the top league in Canada at the time. Sec. 8 notes:

>Sec. 8. The puck may be stopped but, not carried or knocked on, by any part of the body, nor shall any player close his hand on, or carry the puck to the ice in his hand. No player shall raise his stick above the shoulder, except in lifting the puck. Charging from behind, tripping, collaring, kicking or shinning shall not be allowed, and for any infringement of these rules, the Referee may rule the offending player off the ice for that match, or for such portion of actual playing time as he may see fit.

This is the first reference I can find to players being specifically sent off, a trend that continues into the modern day. That said, how did this come about?

For that I can not find a clear answer. I reached out to some other people who know hockey history, and was advised it may stem from lacrosse, which has a similar procedure for penalized players. Lacrosse as we know it today also came from Montreal, with the first modern games played there in 1867. Lacrosse is something I am not familiar enough with to get into here, so I cannot comment further on that, but the links between the two sports are well-established, and it would not be surprising if that is the case.

That said, I can also comment that a specific penalty box was not formally established until 1916; before that players were simply sent off for a while (notably goaltenders as well, until the mid-1930s; when that happened a non-goalie would usually take over for the few minutes, most famously by Lester Patrick in 1928, who was the 44-year-old coach of his team; [see his photo here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lpatrick.jpg)). Even then, it was not until 1963 that the NHL mandated separate boxes for players on opposing teams, a wise choice considering the players sent off would sometimes keep fighting (even today a shouting match and taunting are not uncommon, despite the glass partition). *Sports Illustrated* wrote [an article in 2018 about this more recent history](https://www.si.com/nhl/2018/04/17/penalty-box-history-nhl-playoffs)^3, which is definitely worth reading, though they don't go into the very early origins.

I hope that clears some things up, and if you have any other questions just let me know.

1. There are likely earlier games, but this is the first recorded one.
2. Ferrell was an outstanding player himself, and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
3. It may be paywalled, and apologies if so."
AskHistorians,Why did Nina Simone lose rest over Tennessee in “Mississippi Goddamn”?,"(Apologies for any formatting issues. This is my first post here, and the lesser-known legal history of the Civil Rights era is one of my pet topics to study.)

As you suggested, Nina Simone most likely wrote those lyrics in response to the general unrest that Tennessee had experienced in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, there were a few incidents in Tennessee that gained more national notoriety and could have served as inspiration for the song, mostly centering around Clinton High School.

Clinton High School was the first public school in Tennessee to be integrated on August 27, 1956, shortly after a Tennessee district court ordered desegregation in Anderson County high schools in early 1956. Secondary sources state that most Clinton natives opposed desegregation but felt resigned to its outcome due to the school board's announcement of compliance with desegregation orders from the federal courts. Court cases from that era document the initial integration of these students as ""without picketing or violence of any kind,"" with out-of-state actors arriving to agitate the scene and organize a protest movement. 

One particular out-of-towner, John Kasper, organized numerous events and speaking engagements in Clinton to protest the integration of the local school, despite having no connections to the area. Kasper, a New Jersey native, graduated from Columbia and lived in Washington DC before packing up most of his belongings and driving to Clinton in late August 1956. Kasper claimed to be a member of the ""Seaboard White Citizens Councils"" and handed out pamphlets to Clinton residents advertising his organization and pro-segregation speeches/events. Although initial protests against desegregation remained relatively nonviolent, Kasper's rallies and agitation from traveling white supremacists elevated the violent nature of the crowds.  Despite efforts from Clinton law enforcement to detain Kasper, as well as local court orders forbidding him from disturbing integration efforts, he managed to rally even larger crowds of over a thousand people for his now-banned speeches. His speeches motivated the white residents to more aggressively fight the desegregation efforts more in the largest protests of the incident, even when Kasper was detained due to court hearings and unable to attend further rallies. 

Over 3 days (August 30-September 1, 1956), a crowd of 300 people throwing tomatoes and stones at the black students grew to an estimated 3,000 people, with many white supremacist groups joining in from outside the region. A state of emergency was announced, and local police had to bring in the National Guard for assistance. After copious use of tear gas, as well as the threats of National Guard tanks and police force bayonets, the crowd eventually dispersed on September 2. This unrest in Clinton gained widespread news coverage, and the National Guard helped enforce temporary speech and association bans through the rest of September to prevent further incidents.

As a side note: Kasper was found guilty of criminal contempt for his violation of court orders and sentenced to a year in prison in August 1956, although he was released on bail pending appeal (for which white Clinton residents paid). He was also charged with sedition and inciting a riot later that November but was eventually acquitted following a trial. Kasper spent much of the next decade traveling the rest of the South to protest desegregation, racking up further charges for disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, loitering, and other similar charges. Despite his fame and success during these tours, Kasper's later attempt at a political career caused whatever notoriety he had obtained to fizzle out. He eventually moved back North and returned to ""normal"" family life, and his impact in Clinton has long outlived whatever else he achieved afterward.

Although no widescale protests occurred for the rest of the 1956-1957 school year, further incidents indicated that tensions between white and black residents of Clinton continued to rise. In December 1956, Reverend Paul Turner volunteered to help escort black students to school in an act of solidarity, as he was white and was the pastor of a largely-white local Baptist church. When he dropped off the students and turned to leave, Turner was confronted by a group of individuals, alleged to be members of the segregationist organization White Citizens Council. These individuals beat Turner, breaking his nose and causing severe bruising and cuts on his face. One person was eventually arrested for this incident but was released on bond (paid for by the White Citizens Council) shortly after. The Clinton High School principal closed the school for a week in response to this beating but reaffirmed his stance that the school would comply with desegregation orders. There were continued incidents of protesting and violence, particularly in response to Bobby Cain's status as the first African American to graduate from a formally segregated public high school in the South in 1957. However, no public response matched that of the protests from the Fall of 1956.

Early into the Fall Semester of 1958, Clinton High School was bombed by unknown parties. Approximately 100 sticks of dynamite were placed in three corners of the school, and their detonation practically decimated the structure. Nobody was injured in the explosion, although damages were estimated at $300,000 (or about $2.7 million when adjusted for inflation in 2020). Due to its status as the only public high school in Clinton, students were bussed to Oak Ridge for two years during rebuilding efforts. Clinton High School reopened in its previous location in 1960 and has been operating ever since. The first group of African American students to attend the school, known as the Clinton 12, were inducted into the school's Wall of Fame as a collective in 2010. They were also memorialized in bronze statues in 2007, which you can visit at the Green McAdoo Cultural Center in Clinton.

Additional events that could have inspired the lyrics include the Hattie Cotton Elementary School Bombing in 1957, as well as the Nashville Sit-ins/Student Movement of 1960. Simone was likely inspired by these events as well, as information regarding them was disseminated through news media, although on a smaller scale than the Clinton High School protests.

Notably, Simone would often change the lyrics of ""Mississippi Goddamn"" when performing it to honor the various events and civil rights leaders of the day. She substituted Selma, St. Augustine, and Watts, for Tennessee in the ""Tennessee's made me lose my rest"" line. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, she sang the song with the substitution of ""Memphis's made me lose my rest.""

AskHistorians,Why are Anglosphere Indian communities so disproportionately Punjabi Sikh?,"There are multiple reasons for this. Sikhs have been a global community from their inception. Sikhs were spread across the Middle East into South East Asia during the community's development during the Sikhs Guru period. Records from the period note Sikhs from Baghdad to Chittagong, Myanmar and everything in between. It was also a multifaceted community with a mercantile class (Khatri's) leading the community, who were highly mobile trading communities. Sikh familiarity with the anglosphere predated the Sikh Empire, with individuals recorded in Salem, Massachusetts, by the 1760s. Many were already living under the rule of the British East India Company by the time Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over northern India from the 1800s.  Ranjit Singh also incorporated many Europeans into his military and administrative ranks. Napoleon's officers (Ventura and Allard) commanded the Sikh armies; white Americans administered different regions while Scotsman, Germans and other groups were incorporated into army ranks. Meaning the Sikhs Empire was a highly diverse and prosperous society with people from all over the globe living, working and serving in the Empire.  When the British finally annexed Punjab in the 1840s, they essentially took over a people highly adept to European ways and customs, trained under French Generals and very familiar with their counterparts who were now their rulers. Because of their prowess on the battlefield and willingness to travel, the British rapidly incorporated them into colonial machinery and sent them across the world.  The military deployment, and parades, especially during the late nineteenth century, accelerated Sikh migration into the British Empire. Many brought back stories of new lands, economic opportunity and exciting adventures, which Sikhs took up in large numbers.    Hindus had a lot of religious inhibition from travelling especially travelling over Kala Pani or Black Waters, which they interpreted as the ocean. They were much more apprehensive about leaving India initially.

Throughout the Indian migrations, Sikhs have always been at the top when it comes to leaving India, a lot has to do with this historical legacy and current contextual issues, such as politics, economics and the prestige of migrating to western nations."

AskHistorians,Why has so little seem to have been written about the Spanish flu even though it killed 50 million people (or about 200 million today as a percentage of total population)?,"So we actually talk about this in the 100-level Modern U.S. course I teach at a SLAC on the East Coast of the U.S. The issue of why the influenza pandemic hasn't been really discussed well in many taught narratives is actually a conversation that, given recent events, has been re-ignited, and there have been a few theories. As our dear moderator suggested, your own results may vary depending on where/when you are, but like any good historian will tell you, the reason is likely a confluence of factors.

For one thing, the pandemic hit at the end of WWI, and a disease is a very different history to narrativize than war. War experience obviously varies from person to person, but in a period of intense nationalism, the war during (and afterwards) was framed as a collective event. Your nation - and most everyone around you - felt like part of the war process, for better or for worse. WWI in America, for example, saw the advent of the Committee on Public Information, which many would argue literally wrote the book on national war narrativization. 

Disease is different. It can hit one house and take out everyone, and leave the next house untouched. Your symptoms, the mental/physical toll it leaves behind, the severity of your own experiences with it all may differ substantially at a local and national level. On top of this, there's no clear enemy to blame, and often it felt as if there was no real rhyme or reason to who thrived, who survived, and who didn't. That can make it much harder for any one story to stand in for many others. 

There might be other, more socially-conditioned reasons as well. For one, many of those on the ""front lines"" were nurses - in many ways, the war of the pandemic was one dominated by female ""soldiers."" It was also a global event - you would think this would make it more important to talk about, but in national history courses (at least in the U.S.), this could often mean that educators - whose time is already constrained - might simply assume/hope someone else will cover it down the line. 

There might be another force at play here too. The virus was spread throughout much of the world largely due to two factors: a global world war, and a globally connected trade/extraction network. To emphasize the full might of the pandemic globally would be to contend with a lot of tough questions about capitalism and colonialism. 

I - and many of my colleagues - are rightly trying to devote more time to talking about a topic that has so much relevance in 2023 (and students seem to 'get' the 1920's more than they used to!), but it's very much a work in progress. Hope this elucidates a few potential reasons - and I'd love to hear if there are more!

AskHistorians,"“The press in 1776 was entirely propaganda. Newspapers were owned by political party big wigs. The concept of objective journalism is relatively new within the last century"". How correct is that statement?","I have an [older answer](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mpdfpr/what_did_the_first_newspapers_in_the_united/) on early newspapers that I'll paste in the next comment below, but let's take a minute to unpack ""objectivity"" if we can. It's certainly the case that most newspapers were partisan throughout U.S. history -- the First Amendment protects freedom of the press (to publish what it wants), and early newspapers were specifically partisan outlets. But the idea of ""professionalization"" of the news process is a fairly recent one, within the past 120 years or so, and comes out of the progressive/reform movements of the turn of the past century. The first ""professional"" school of journalism was founded at the University of Missouri, in 1908, and was explicitly a trade school, intended to train up newspapermen (and they intended to be all men at first; Mary Paxton was the first woman graduate in 1910) in the new ideal of ""objective"" journalism, which was in and of itself a social construct. 

It's worth pausing for a minute and considering the Journalist's Creed, which was penned by Walter Williams around this time and served/serves as a motto for the journalism school: 

> I believe in the profession of journalism.

> I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust.

>I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.

>I believe that a journalist should write only what he holds in his heart to be true.

> I believe that suppression of the news, for any consideration other than the welfare of society, is indefensible.

>I believe that no one should write as a journalist what he would not say as a gentleman; that bribery by one’s own pocketbook is as much to be avoided as bribery by the pocketbook of another; that individual responsibility may not be escaped by pleading another’s instructions or another’s dividends.

>I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.

>I believe that the journalism which succeeds best — and best deserves success — fears God and honors Man; is stoutly independent, unmoved by pride of opinion or greed of power, constructive, tolerant but never careless, self-controlled, patient, always respectful of its readers but always unafraid, is quickly indignant at injustice; is unswayed by the appeal of privilege or the clamor of the mob; seeks to give every man a chance and, as far as law and honest wage and recognition of human brotherhood can make it so, an equal chance; is profoundly patriotic while sincerely promoting international good will and cementing world-comradeship; is a journalism of humanity, of and for today’s world.

This idea of ""independence"" of the press is important in the sense that it does represent a(n ideal of) a break from newspapers being blatantly partisan organs; it's also the case that it's aspirational, and not how newspapers actually functioned. In this era, what's also happening (to go back to the 1880s or so) is that we have a rise in newspapers that were specifically funded by advertising, rather than by subscriptions or specifically by funding from a party. Advertisers want to sell their stuff to everyone, regardless of partisan affiliation, so at this point, it makes sense for ""straight news"" to become less partisan, and for the partisan stuff (such as it is) to be folded into the ""opinion"" section -- this distinction between news and opinion at the time was very unclear to civilians, and remains so in the present day. 

But in any case, as these things do, the ""professional"" school breeds disciples that are more zealous at times than their teachers. Walter Lippman comes to mind as someone who encourages journalists to work in a ""scientific"" spirit (because we all know how objective science is...)  and we reach a point in the mid-20th century that values ""objectivity"" to the extent that some newspapermen boast that they're so ""objective"" they don't even vote (Len Downie, the former WaPo editor, is a good example of this). 

Objectivity in the mid-20th century is performative; it's also a consequence of privilege. If you're a middle- or upper-class white man, it's easy to say you don't pay attention to politics, or aren't affected by it; if you're someone who's marginalized in any way -- by poverty, race, gender, so on -- you can't escape being ""biased."" Possibly the most extreme, idiotic, example of this I saw when working in a newsroom is when an editor refused to let a Chinese student cover Lunar New Year celebrations because she would be ""biased."" 

But at this point, up to 2003 or so to not violate our 20-year rule, many more working journalists are realizing that everything is written from a point of view -- the ""view from nowhere"" is a philosophical construct that is a nice rhetorical device and has very little practical application. Everyone is biased because all of us have blind spots, and privilege or the lack thereof. 

Now, to be clear, this doesn't mean that journalism doesn't have a mission, or can't be trusted. Journalism at its heart is a process of verification -- the most important question a journalist asks is ""how do you know that"" -- and that means it's not a ""both sides"" report. ""We're not saying the earth is flat, we're saying HE's saying the earth is flat"" is falling out of vogue, and hopefully we're all the better for that.

AskHistorians,What happened to the property of people who died during the Black Death?,"It might be proper to start that Boccacio´s account is a literary work, so it should be approached as such. But not to take this dismissal too far, numerous chronicles at the time lament the same climate of abandonment to be found across the continent;

>Listen to the tearful voices of the sick:  
>  
>’Have pity, have pity, my friends. At least say something, now that the hand of God has touched me. Oh father, why have you abandoned me? For you forget that I am your child? Mother, where have you gone? Why are you now so cruel to me when only yesterday you were so kind? You fed me at your breast and carried me within your womb for nine months.’  
>  
>My children, who I brought up with toil and sweat, why have you run away?’  
>  
>Man and wife reached out to each other, ‘Alas, once we slept happily together but now are separated and wretched’ \[…\] in the throes of death, they still called out piteously to their family and neighbours, ‘Come here. I’m thirsty; bring me a drink of water. I’m still alive. Don’t be frightened. Perhaps I won’t die. Please hold me tight, hug my wasted body’

As this sentiment with ebbs and flows continues through subsequent epidemics – but on the other hand, there are also accounts of profound solidarity and communal fellowship in dire times. Bishop of Bath and Wells during the epidemic allowed any lay person, be it man or woman, to take the sacrament of last penance if no priests were available.^(1,2)

How all this influenced property ownership and other social structures is a fraught issue – like any generalisations. It would depend greatly upon locations, not just due to the obvious differences of plague intensity, but in what jurisdiction it occurred. Countryside was effected differently with its partitioning (villas and estates could be temporarily vacant, but they were not ripe for anyone´s taking), so were cities, it hinged on the nature of  legal relation of property in the city – tenancies from other owners or simply from the city itself in some cases, which could reverse depending on tenancy contracts and heirs. Countryside likewise, it could reverse, or depending on tenancy, be inherited via testament, intestate, or simply rented out to new tenants or abandoned.^(3) There was little uniformity to *bona vacantia/hereditas iacens* at this time, it could be offered merely within specifics, granted that the research was done, so, beside what was mentioned above to the reversals, usually a Church got a portion (or other relevant ecclesiastical entity), most often a fifth, it reversed in other forms back to the communities - at the most extreme, it could go into royal fiscus. Some Italian cities offer us indispensable insights with testamentary booms in times of epidemics – they kept functioning and show vivid notary activityy^(4), but testamentary inheritance is harded to summarize, it could go to friends, acquaintances, organizations, ecclesiastical entities, guilds, ... Likewise, how exactly citizenships operated is hard to say (notary and other practices sometimes lack consistency, changes, liberalization for repopulation – a contentious issue^(5)).

Microstudies will be problematic due to the nature of records, since testaments and other records offer only a snippet of the situation – where they were done, like Bologna, up to Britain with manorial studies.^(6)

Over the next 150 years, we also gradually observe some legal developments of exceptions to the state of epidemics (suspensions, sanitations, limitations,... in a more systematic and informed manner, as opposed to previous ad hoc standard sanitary measures), insofar as they temporarily change both canon, private and public laws (classification might be a bit anachronistic to get it that far back) – with rather systematic treaties by the early 16th century, most notably della Ripa (1522) *Tractatus Iuridicus ac Politicus de peste* and Previdelli (1524) *Tractatus legalis de peste,* which were highly influential to later jurists in later development of private law and codifications in late 18th and throughout 19th century. Exactly how these developments played out during the preceding century and a half practically ad hoc as necessity dictated (e.g. some Italian cities allowed illegitimate children as heirs), or even later, is an issue all on its own. To offer a sense of what these would look like, *privilegia pestis* as plague privileges with various legal protections and tax breaks at places of refuge, legal fictions to maintain the status of those born in refuge, discharge of various contractual liabilities, even with tenancy contracts (to which I will return below), ameliorations of rigid testamentary formalities and other procedural laws etc.

I should stress here the dichotomy between *ius commune* and actual legal practice, since receptions was gradual and variable due to its subsidiary applicability, we have a long development of juristic treaties with spotty actual records with little archival work done on the issue (numerous reasons) – in any case, this was probably not relevant to mid-14th century, except through deliberate local interventions (which did happen though, as the Bishop above demonstrated). How this looked like later, E.g. a lessee (party in leasing contracts, often for some form of real estate contract) could vacate a property without notification to a lessor during the epidemic, and the leasing contract was kept in place – a lessee still had a claim to the property and it could not be unilaterally broken (we have some jurists by the 17th century holding that contracts could be unilaterally broken by material changes in conditions, like plague, but they were never dominant). In certain circumstances, a lessee could be excused of payments or sought after equitable solutions - which can be found later in early civil codifications.

AskHistorians,How did transgender people survive throughout human history without modern transition surgeries or modern hormone therapy? No offense intended. Just asking out of curiosity.,"So your question about ""surviving"" is an interesting way to frame this. I assume that you are wondering how trans people in the past managed gender dysphoria without being able to take medical steps to alter their body, since today, being barred from medical treatment for dysphoria creates a major mental health risk for trans people.

Contemporary Western society's categories of trans identities have some things in common with past trans identities and other unique aspects. One relatively unique aspect of modern trans identities is the prominence of *binary* trans identity: that is, someone who identities as a trans man or trans woman and wishes to incorporate *nothing* of their assigned gender at birth into their current gender identity. In many societies in history (and today), trans identities were not conceptualized in such a binary way. In other words, people of the past who transitioned FtM or MtF were not necessarily looking to discard every aspect of their assigned gender at birth in order to be recognised as their chosen gender.

This is hard to explain in the abstract so let me use some examples. I've written a fair amount on AH in the past about Indigenous third genders, or gender categories which Indigenous societies traditionally used to incorporate trans people into society. You can see some of those discussions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rs9ora/comment/hqqfelj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sir6uh/comment/hvayuyw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). In English, North American Indigenous third genders are usually discussed under the umbrella term ""Two Spirit."" The idea behind this term, and behind many of the Indigenous gender systems it alludes to, is that a trans person holds both male and female identities inside themselves. Rather than try to ""pass"" as a cisgender person, third gender people were more or less included in the activities of their chosen gender while also retaining special gender features unique to someone who had experienced both male and female social gender.

So for example, among the Unangan (Aleut) people, a MtF person was known as ayagigux', literally ""man transformed into woman."" An ayagigux' mostly partook in women's work and typically married cisgender men just like cisgender women usually did. Their beard hairs were plucked out, and they recieved women's facial tattoos which marked their social gender as decidedly female. However, because they had experienced the liminality of being both male and female at different points in their life, an ayagigux' could perform special religious roles that involved bridging the gaps between other important categories like human and animal or life and death (often described as ""shamanism"" in English). Neither cisgender men nor cisgender women performed these special roles, which is what leads to some anthropologists using terms like ""third gender"" to describe genders like this.

What I'm getting at here is that the idea of ""passing"", which is at the root of a lot of gender dysphoria, was/is not an issue in some societies the way it is in contemporary Western society. There was no social danger in being ""clocked"" as trans, so there was no social pressure to completely conform one's physical appearance to a cisgender standard. Indigenous third gender/Two Spirit people were sometimes indistinguishable from cis people at a glance due to clothing and hair styles (e.g. in Alaska where clothing was very thick and revealed little of body shape), but more often, they were not. The Diné (Navajo) artist Hosteen Klah was a nádleehi (roughly MtF) person who wore both masculine and feminine forms of dress, continued to use male pronouns in English, and combined women's weaving with men's sandpainting to create unique works of art that cisgender people wouldn't necessarily have had the skills to make. Klah never sought to conform to the gender binary because his culture had four genders which allowed people like him to fit comfortably into a gender role that suited their personal mixture of masculine and feminine genders.

In conclusion, we can't know for certain whether any people in pre-colonial Indigenous societies may have felt a level of gender dysphoria that couldn't be fully soothed by the transition options available to them. However, the concept of gender dysphoria just doesn't seem to apply in the same way in a situation where there were established gender roles that didn't require one to ""pass"" completely from one binary identity to another. Many trans people today, whether they have a binary trans identity or a non-binary one, experience gender dysphoria because we live in a society that puts such a high emphasis on physical appearance in determining gender identity, which leads to trans people being misgendered repeatedly if their body doesn't conform to a binary standard. In societies where the body played a less important role in determining gender, and being visibly trans would not lead to misgendering, gender dysphoria was probably much less of a problem."

AskHistorians,Why did small countries survive?,"I’ll restrict to mainland Europe first, based on the examples given: most micro-states are either there or, at least by population, small island nations. 

Europe once has many of what could be considered little microstates or tiny fiefdoms. Five remain independent, depending on definition. Three managed to survive the formations of and conquest by the bigger countries because they met at a nexus of competing claims by larger countries, didn’t feel like joining up some nationalistic movement, played the bigger countries against each other, and being small weren’t ever seen as urgent to invade at the risk of upsetting another power. There is a reason they lie between larger countries. Two others are enclosed by Italy, and historically relied on Italian goodwill. 

**Luxembourg** is maybe the most complicated case, since it’s not *that* small and other countries certainly wanted to absorb it. It was once ruled by Austria (the Habsburgs expanded through marriage and once ruled nearly all of what is now Benelux) but after Napoleon had overrun it and then been defeated, the more modernising Metternich (the famous Austrian Chancellor) didn’t want it back, since it was their last holding that wasn’t connected to Austria proper and was landlocked, which made it a massive hassle to run. While fighting Napoleon, Prussia had invaded  and occupied much of it, but Austria wasn’t as keen on expanding Prussian power and the Dutch decided that given its location and its language they should have it (Luxembourgish wasn’t considered a separate language then, and their speakers were identified as Dutch as much as German, being on a continuum of Low Franconian dialects that include Dutch and ‘German dialects’). To keep a balance of powers the Congress of Vienna awarded it to the Dutch king but as a separate grand duchy rather than part of the Netherlands, but the Prussians were still occupying it, and so they forced it to become part of the German Confederation - though not a fully integrated part. 

As such it was part in and part out of Prussian rule (and later Germany) as well as the Netherlands (ruled by the Dutch king). When Belgium seceded from the Netherlands they took Lux with them, but due to its special status they agreed to split it away as part of the post war negotiations, and Lux also became independent, and later left even personal union with the NL due to different laws of succession concerning women. Germany and France came to diplomatic blows over Luxembourg but peace was considered more important and it remained a buffer state after the 1867 London Conference, though in the German Zollverein (Customs Union). Germany steamrolled over Lux in both world wars but obviously that wasn’t respected afterwards in either case. 

**Liechtenstein**. When the Duchy of Swabia within the HRE ended back in the 13th c (gruesomely), its lands were split up and the villages that would be Liechtenstein today (Vaduz - the so-called ‘capital’, Schaan and Schellenberg, which are a formal intertwining mess on the map and basically make up the country) went directly to the Emperor. The ambitious Liechtenstein family, who mostly ruled lands within Austria (so at least two levels down within the Empire), legally needed such to get land immediately held from the Emperor to get the most coveted status of Reichsfürst or ‘imperial prince’... but weren’t able to marry into the larger princely families. But they finally managed to acquire these villages that way, and tiny as they were they technically counted. In the 1800s they found themselves caught between Prussia and Austria too in the fight for German supremacy, and lost the rest of their lands, but still had those villages (now named after their House) and took a leaf from their Swiss neighbours and declared neutrality, the one German house in a position to do so, as they were not geographically as exposed to Prussian expansion and the Habsburgs expanded on dynastic rather than nationalistic grounds. No one cared enough to violate it. They never joined Switzerland either because Switzerland was neutral for self-preservation and not about to try conquering anyone, and a prince is unlikely to want to hand his land over to a republic. 

**San Marino** is also quite remote and hilly, without much in the way of vast resources worth the trouble, and has only been invaded a few times over many centuries. They *wanted* to stay independent and not join Italian unification because they had a long established republic they were very proud of (by tradition at least, dating back to the 4th century). They were *allowed* to because early in his expeditions they gave refuge to Italy’s national hero, Garibaldi, and the general who led much of their unification wars, and asked him to respect it, he was a man of his word, and a tiny enclosed republic hardly dashed his dreams of overall Italian independence and unification when there were foreigners and despots of larger lands to oust. 

**Andorra** was formally the land ruled directly by the Bishops of Urgell, but as they lacked the military to defend them they appealed to the Lord Arnaud of Caboet, and later his son-in-law the Count of Foix, whose descendants through marriages eventually became kings of Navarre and then France, while the wider diocese of Urgell was ruled by Spain at a secular level. Andorra’s deal was for them both to remain head of state, and to send tribute (an established list of a few dozen food items) to both. The Bishop of Urgell and President of France are both technically princes of Andorra to this day. Except when the two were at war, they both found it more prudent to leave Andorra alone when it would mean upsetting their bigger neighbour for no gain, basically the secret to survival for most of these little countries, and this has always been the peacetime status quo. 

**Monaco.** Centuries ago Monaco wasn’t surrounded by France, but one of a patchwork of ‘Italian’ states, many of which were controlled by Spain. They played both sides in the Franco-Spanish war in the 1600s (in the wake of the 30 Years War) and agreed to become a French protectorate and let the French kick out the Spanish they’d earlier asked to protect them, provided France mostly left them alone. During Italian reunification, the Italians (or rather the Kingdom of ‘Sardinia’) needed French support against Austria to acquire Lombardy (and the French would go on to protect the Papal States, which Italy wanted too), so in order to sweeten the deal they agreed to hand over ‘Sardinia’s’ territory around Monaco, including Nice, to the French. Incidentally this was much more objectionable to the same Garibaldi above, who was born a ‘Nizzard’, and was furious that Sardinian and then Italian prime minister Cavour ‘made him a Frenchman’. Monaco wasn’t included since the Sardinians had never acquired it - it had long protected by the French beforehand, as well as being on top of a heavily fortified rock and not really worth the trouble. The deal left Monaco with only one land border, so theoretically more at the mercy of the French, but by then France’s days of conquest in Europe were over, and Monaco chose that time to abolish all income tax, many rich people of influence now having a strong interest in it remaining independent. 

**The Vatican.** Pope Pius XI didn’t want to pay taxes to Mussolini, or be subject to his laws, and he obviously had a very special status and a great deal of global influence, so could literally ask for his own country and get it. Mussolini wanted to keep good relations with other Catholic countries, so they signed the Lateran Treaty of 1929. The Papal States had made up the whole central belt of Italy for over a millennium until absorption within then living memory, so this wasn’t seen as too unusual."
AskHistorians,Why was a relatively small percentage of the Jewish population of Germany murdered compared to Poland's during the Holocaust?,"The different death tolls of different Jewish populations reflect a number of factors, from the size of the prewar Jewish populations and their socioeconomic circumstances to the different policies applied at different points during the war. You asked specifically about Germany and Poland so I’ll focus my response on those populations comparatively.

The German-Jewish population numbered about 500,000 when the Nazis took power and was overwhelmingly middle class. For the first six years or so of the Nazi regime, Jews were strongly encouraged to emigrate, and many did because they had the economic means to do so. Therefore, only around 150,000 were in the country by the time the war began. Deportations of German Jews to ghettoes in occupied Poland the USSR began in the fall of 1941 but mass murder of deportees did not become common until the following year. German Jews not deported directly to death camps had a better chance of surviving if they did some kind of work that was necessary to the German war effort, and many did.

In contrast, there were 3 million Jews in Poland when the Nazis, most of whom had no ability to escape once their country was invaded. Being mostly working class or poor, their ability to negotiate an exit of some kind and their access to resources for survival were comparatively limited. Even those Jews who fled east upon the Nazi invasion of Poland eventually found themselves subject to Nazi rule with Operation Barbarossa, after which point the Jewish policy became explicitly exterminationist. A number of unforeseen factors — mainly the overcrowding in Jewish ghettoes in Poland and consequent concerns for public health, reluctance of many German soldiers to engage in mass shootings, and the inability to knock the Soviets out of the war in fall 1941 — resulted in distinct plan to exterminate Polish Jews, called Aktion Reinhart. This program was overwhelmingly successful: 90% of Polish Jews were murdered. The only way out was proving useful for forced labor, but even then the end goal was extermination once exhaustion made labor no longer an option.

There is an enormous literature on the Holocaust, obviously, but a key text explaining Nazi decision making and its evolution before and during the war is Christopher Browning’s *Origins of the Final Solution.* An excellent overall source on the Holocaust and particularly on prewar escalation of Nazi Jewish policy toward extermination remains Raul Hilberg’s *Destruction of the European Jews*. Finally an excellent recent work with this focus is Christian Gerlach’s *Extermination of the European Jews*."
AskHistorians,"Mexican nationalism often focuses on Aztec heritage. How did Mexico manage to square that with being a predominantly Spanish-speaking and Catholic country? Were there ever efforts to revive Nahuatl? (Not that it's extinct, but it's a small minority language today)","Shelly Errington in “Nationalizing The Pre-Columbian Past in Mexico and He United States,”  from her book *The Death of Authentic Primitive Art: And Tales of Other Progress,*   looks at the use of ancient culture and the creation of a national identity in Mexico.   

According to Errington, Mexico’s nationalist story divides Mexico into two eras—indigenous prehistory and mestizo history. Errington points out the post-Conquest identity promoted by these institutions is distinctly mestizo. Rather than putting an emphasis on Spanish or indigenous histories it focuses on the people and culture that combines the two. According to Errington, this a product of Spanish laws which created an identity of resistance for those of mixed ancestry that becomes more important following independence, and resistance to the dictatorship of Porfirio Dias. 

This approach seriously limits the number of cultures considered to be “Mexican” by privileging the minority of the ancient, colonial, and modern populations who live in the Valley of Mexico. The Valley of Mexico is the core, and all culture diffuses out from it. The cultures located in the prehistory periphery are Mexican, but not Mexican in the same way the Aztecs are. Those that exist in the modern periphery are also “Othered” because of their geographic location but also occasionally because of their lack of Spanish heritage. As Errington notes periphery cultures are given space in Mexican museums although they are separated from “true” Mexican pre-history through their placement in smaller galleries, or in the “ethnographic” sections of the museums.  

She also suggest that the cultures given prominence in national museums, such as the Aztec, were conquered relatively quickly while those left to the margins of museum display (the Maya and western Mexico) fought the Colonial and then Mexican government. Thus, those included in the National identity were subsumed by the Viceregal system and later national system or they are so old (Teotihuacan) they don't threaten those in power."
AskHistorians,Was Nero's neckbeard a common fashion of the time or would it have been considered weird by contemporary standards?,"The style is not entirely unique in portraiture, but it is quite rare for Roman emperors.

The bust does represent Nero, but it is inauthentic in another way: it is mostly a restoration. If you zoom in on the face (for instance in [this picture of the bust](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Nero_1.JPG)) you will see that the forehead and parts of the hair and nose are in a different colour; these are the only surviving ancient parts of the sculpture, the rest being created during the Renaissance. However the reconstruction is not that different from how he looks in genuine busts and coins (see [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Roma%2C_nerone%2C_aureo%2C_64-65_dc.JPG) and [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Nero_Palatino_Inv618.jpg), for example).

I am not aware of any earlier example of this beard-style in Roman art, but we do have several from the Hellenistic kings, notably the Ptolemies and Seleucids ([here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Ring_with_engraved_portrait_of_Ptolemy_VI_Philometor_%283rd%E2%80%932nd_century_BCE%29_-_2009.jpg) and [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/PtolemyIX-StatueHead_MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png) are members of the former, and [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Antiochos_IX_Kyzikenos%2C_Tetradrachm%2C_110-109_BC%2C_HGC_3-1228i.jpg), [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Antakya_Archaeological_Museum_Antiochus_X_Eusebes_Philopator_head_sept_2019_5835.jpg) and [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Demetrius_III_akairos.jpg) being of the latter dynasty). It could be that Nero adopted the style due to its associations with Hellenistic kings, since he was very interested in Greek culture (even taking part in the Olympics!) and seems to have attempted a more Hellenistic style of rulership. Though I have also seen the argument that it was a military style. 

Later the emperor Titus is also shown with a neckbeard on some coins ([like](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Titus_Augustus_Denarius.png) [these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/TITUS_RIC_II_19-158037_%28obverse%29.jpg)). And during the Flavian period we have some other busts portraying men with similar styles: for example [this](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/248142) in the Met Museum and [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Josephusbust.jpg) (previously misidentified as Josephus\*) in the Glyptotek in Copenhagen. Note that both of these also have slight moustaches so they are not precisely the same style, but quite similar. Far later the emperors [Decius](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Bust_of_Decius_-_Palazzo_Nuovo_-_Musei_Capitolini_-_Rome_2016_%283%29_%28cropped%29.jpg) and [Tacitus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/P1150181_Louvre_empereur_Tacite_Ma1018_rwk_%28cropped_enhanced%29.jpg) are also depicted with a sort of neckbeard, though this was at a time when short-cropped beards or stubbles were in fashion rather than the shaven faces of the pre-Hadrianic Imperial period.

The question of Nero's beard was also [discussed some time ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/79l8cp/why_did_nero_have_a_strange_neckbeard_in_the_1st/) by u/Deirdre_Rose, if you are interested in a different perspective on it.

AskHistorians,"Many impostors pretending to be the children of Nicholas II have existed. However, most of them seem to have either impersonated his youngest daughter, Anastasia, or his youngest child and only son, Alexei. Is there a particular reason for this?","I actually have a previous answer on this, which I'll paste below:

In the immediate aftermath of the killing of the Romanovs at Ipatiev House in the summer of 1918, the Bolsheviks actually gave the impression that she, her siblings, and her mother were alive. The government publicly announced that Alexandra and Alexei (and by implication, probably the tsarevnas) were sent on to another house, and that only Nikolai had been executed - most likely because the rest of the world would have not felt great about a fourteen-year-old boy, his mother, and his sisters, aged seventeen to twenty-three, as well as their doctor, cook, footman, and maid, being executed violently by the state. When the monarchist White Army captured the house a week after the deaths, they found nothing left but bloodstains and bullet holes in the cellar, and assumed they would need to find the rest of the royal family. However, in early 1919 the White Army's inspector concluded that all of them had been murdered, and in 1920 eyewitness testimony from four guards was made public, describing how the Romanovs and their staff were ordered to dress, pack, and wait in the cellar for vehicles, and then shot. The area around the house had been inspected, and jewels and bits of clothing were found near local mine shafts ... but no significant bodily remains were recovered, which the inspector determined must have meant that the corpses were hacked apart, burned, and dissolved in acid.

Stories of the family's survival and escape were flying throughout 1919 and 1920 regardless of the official inspections, and the lack of bodies made them convincing. As early as the fall of 1918, a supposed Anastasia was being put forward, only to be labeled a fraud by Princess Elena of Serbia. (She was a Romanov by marriage; her husband, along with other Romanovs, had been thrown alive down a mineshaft on Bolshevik orders.) Soon after, a woman in Siberia with a son and daughter claimed to be the Empress Alexandra, her children Alexei and Anastasia; the next year, a young man claimed to be Alexei and was met with worshipful crowds until faced with the royal tutor, Pierre Gilliard, who saw through him. A doctor claimed to have treated Anastasia's wounds. Vaguer stories also spread that the remaining family members had been spotted here and there, or were living in Japan, or had been given sanctuary in the Vatican. Even into the 1920s, people who'd been close to the Romanovs felt sure that they were dead but couldn't help but hope the rumors that were still swirling around were true. Nikolai's mother, Maria Feodorovna, continued to believe that they were all alive until she died. For members of the royal circle and particularly those who'd fled to Germany or France, the whole event was a personal tragedy on a large scale; for others, it could still be very upsetting, as the deaths of many celebrities and politicians can be today - in either case, there was a emotional aspect that made it easy for those who knew what had happened to be susceptible to stories that someone had survived.

The most famous and most successful Anastasia claimant started her ""career"" in this period, when the world was still grasping at straws. I'm going to copy/paste [a previous answer of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cingl1/why_did_people_think_anastasia_survivedescaped/evb71zy/), as it's pretty thorough:

>The main reason Anastasia is thought of as ""the one"" is that a woman named Anna Anderson claimed to be her through much of the twentieth century (from 1921 to her death in 1984). She was found in a Berlin canal in 1920, having jumped in in a suicide attempt; she wouldn't identify herself, had a few scars as evidence of some past injury, and was obviously mentally disturbed. As ""Fraulein Unbekannt"", she remained in a mental hospital for more than a year, hardly speaking, but behaving in a ""ladylike"" way that made the nurses curious. She also requested and read books in French and English, and spoke Russian as well as German, according to one witness. The first Romanov connection came up a year later, when she was shown a copy of the magazine *Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung* with the grand duchesses on it and a headline about a potential survivor (inside, the speculation was about Anastasia) - her manner changed, and later one she drew a nurse's attention to the resemblance between her and Anastasia. The nurse was reluctant to do so, but when she finally asked her flat-out if she was the Tsar's daughter, the unnamed woman came out with a flood of details about her escape. Word filtered out through a fellow (but short-term) inmate who came to believe she was indeed Anastasia, and reached the Supreme Monarchist Council in Berlin, an antisemitic group that coordinated with aristocratic Russian emigrés. One of the latter briefly recognized her, and then the flood of visitors began. In 1922, she was released into the custody of a minorly aristocratic married couple who'd become very close to her, who kept her in comfort.

>At this time, she really didn't work to take the place in society the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia would have been able to have - she just insisted that she was Anastasia when people were brought in to look at her, although she only asked to be called Annie. (I suspect that this is a huge part of the reason why her story was so compelling - a woman who stands up and says, ""I'm Anastasia. Money please!"" is automatically suspicious, while a woman whose case is only brought to people via supportive third parties and who never asks for anything but her name is seen as having more integrity.) She didn't always recognize the people she was supposed to recognize (and was in turn dismissed by many of the people who came to see if she was the girl they had known), she was very opposed to speaking in Russian, and her escape story was fragmented, contradictory, and uncorroborated by any real evidence; she was also emotionally volatile and, according to the couple's daughter, had no social skills or grasp of refined behavior. Being unable to support herself and a suicide risk, she was passed from supporter to supporter for years. Most importantly, despite her generally obscure situation and the fact that the living people who'd been closest to the royal family dismissed her claim, her story was blowing up across Germany and then the world: tiny scars on her body were represented as the evidence of her having been shot and stabbed, people who'd denied that she was a Romanov were said to have embraced her as a niece or cousin, and many other pieces of ""evidence"" suddenly appeared in the popular consciousness. Multiple adaptations were made, fictionalizing the already-fictional story she told: *Clothes Make the Woman* (1928), the classic *Anastasia* (1956) and a different German one in the same year, the Broadway show *Anya* (1965)[, the more recent animated and now Broadway musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens] ... Decades later, a thorough investigation was undertaken - as thorough as they could be without being able to test DNA - and the courts declared that she failed to meet the standard of proof for taking back Anastasia Romanov's identity, though the newspapers frequently leaned heavily on her side. And now, of course, we do have DNA evidence that shows that she was not Anastasia, and was most likely a Polish factory worker named Franziska Schanzkowska, as rumors had had it even during her lifetime.

But why was it said from the beginning that Anastasia might have survived? Yes, it's since been found that Anastasia and Alexei's bodies were not buried with the others, but were almost totally destroyed, but this came up when people thought that *all* of the bodies were missing and had no physical reason to single her out (or focus on the two of them) - she was not the only sibling said to have survived, but she was by far the most popular. I would suspect that it's because she was the youngest daughter, and therefore seen as the most innocent, her death the most tragic. Her parents' deaths, parallels to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, could be comprehended; Alexei's also followed logically, since the Bolsheviks would want to make sure that the heir to the throne was gone. And how many fairy tales with multiple sister-princesses don't focus mainly on the youngest as the prettiest and most interesting? Anastasia's survival was the most romantic possible option. The story that Anna/Franziska read in the magazine in Berlin recounted how Anastasia had been aided by a sympathetic soldier, out of an army that was bent on eradicating the old order - *that's* a fairy tale, too, and a compelling one."

AskHistorians,Why did American invade Iraq if there were no weapons of mass destruction?,"I think a lot of the retrospective discourse on the Iraq War has calcified around the choices, thinking, and intelligence failures of the Bush43 administration, but it’s important to note that Iraq was already viewed by the US foreign policy establishment as a big problem during the 90s (North Korea was the other big threat immediately post-Cold War.)

Along with a crippling sanctions regime, there were 2 no-fly zones enforced in Iraq by the coalition immediately after the Gulf War of 1991 until the invasion in 2003. What prompted the NFZs were the failed uprisings in ‘91 by Shi’ite and Kurdish rebels that were encouraged by but ultimately not materially supported by the US. In the aftermath, Saddam would brutally repress the Kurds (and not for the first time, e.g., the Anfal genocide in ‘88 using chemical weapons, which would eventually constitute a major case against Saddam with respect to WMDs in the run-up to the 2003 invasion and at his trial) and Marsh Arabs, and the coalition put in place the NFZs and accompanying humanitarian support operations to defend the rebels. This meant that there were already some coalition troops on the ground, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan, and the existence of a low-level conflict of sorts at different times in Iraq throughout the years between ‘91 and 2003. [1]

Moreover, limited bombing campaigns occurred through the Clinton years variously to respond to an Iraqi plot to assassinate HW Bush in Kuwait (fanciful on the part of Saddam), Iraqi military incursions into Kurdistan, Iraqi non-compliance with UN inspections of WMD facilities, and Iraqi air defenses and fighters targeting coalition warplanes. [2] In 1998, Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act, passed with broad bipartisan majorities, and made regime change in Iraq the official policy of the US. [3] The major reason cited was again WMDs: the presence and deployment of chemical and biological weapons and remnants of a nuclear program that were increasingly hidden from weapons inspectors. [4] Saddam had already used chemical weapons multiple times before against the Kurds and Iran during the Iran-Iraq War, and UN weapons inspections since then had revealed an advanced biological weapons program. It was a major concern post-‘91 that Saddam was hiding more WMDs and rearming.

In addition, the role played by some Iraqi dissidents in the West who had political intentions in a post-Saddam Iraq, like Allawi (Iraqi National Accord) and Chalabi (Iraqi National Congress), cannot be left out. These figures at many junctures provided false intelligence about WMDs in Iraq (e.g., Curveball) and Saddam’s links to terrorism and presented themselves as part of a viable national leadership post-invasion. They provided both a push towards invasion and reassurance for a stable aftermath through their lobbying in the late-90s up to 2003. (One of the material results of the Iraq Liberation Act was that many of these groups along with the Kurds were funded by the US government.) They were also installed to important posts within the provisional government and during the transition to democracy after the invasion. [5]

In the end, the pro-war camp of GW Bush’s administration, such as Cheney, Rumsfeld, and those at the Department of Defense, may have only needed so much to make a case for an invasion especially in the aftermath of 9/11, but it’s important to see that their views didn’t just exist in a vacuum or suddenly emerge as the story is often told. Counterfactuals are inherently impossible, but it’s also not difficult to draw a line towards invasion or imagine a more limited campaign to destabilize or remove Saddam in a timeline without GW Bush or 9/11.

AskHistorians,Floating Feature: Here Be Dragons,"One of the things one encounters when using the lens of a folklorist is how easily many cultures have a bedrock assumption that the world some of us see with a clinician’s eye is not all there is out there. This perspective can run parallel with that of the so-called educated and/or aristocracy, which can collectively look down their noses at the “silly peasants.”

Nevertheless, there is a widespread perspective that there is a supernatural realm that co-exists with “our world.” This is something other than the monotheistic realm of God and his minions and the heavenly souls of the departed. Instead, this is a vibrant supernatural world filled with supernatural beings of various – and often dangerous – sorts. There is also an assumption that there are liminal spaces and times when crossing the boundary separating those two realms is particularly easy – times and places when the boundary is paper thin.

Many saw/see water in this capacity, inspiring a European tradition of depositing valuables in a pool, bog, or some similar body of water, as a way of reaching out to the supernatural to procure its good graces. This is apparently at the heart of the tradition of the wishing well and simply of throwing coins into bodies of water of various sorts.

Liminal times were/are also a matter of popular belief. For many cultures, the end of October/beginning of November was a time when the door opened between this and the otherworld, allowing the dead to visit the living. Similarly, the living could visit graves and leave offerings for the benefit of the dead (promoting good relations).

In many places in Europe, the winter solstice serves in this capacity. People often consider Halloween (giving treats to children dressed as otherworldly monsters) or Yule/New Year’s celebrations (leaving a Yule log burning so the ancestors can warm themselves, but also leaving treats for Santa) in this context. Imagining, that these are consequently dressed-up pagan traditions, does a disserve to how popular traditions function. 

Tracing folkloric treads can be maddeningly difficult. Some thin threads may indeed reach back to pre-conversion times but teasing them out of the tapestry and isolating such an influence ignores the fact that folklore is always in flux, borrowing, mutating, adapting with each changing decade and each new valley where it manifests. It is probably better to regard liminal times and places as akin to what may have been much older traditions. Some things simply exist as common denominators whether or not there is a direct connection – and regardless of whether that connection is significant enough to overcome all the changes that were inevitable.

All that said, the point here is that despite the record left by the literate and a highly educated – even scientifically minded – aristocracy and/or clergy, there were always the masses that left little evidence in much of the historical record. We must remember that there people were also there and the records only capture part of the moment, particularly in pre-modern times. Culture is much more complex than that. Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton practiced their sophisticated craft even while at the same time other people held traditional beliefs. For them, the world beyond the horizon was in their midst.

And yes. There were dragons there (although they were generally thought to have existed in a remote time or place)."
AskHistorians,Why did cloaks go out of fashion?,"There's always more to be said, but I have a past answer on this that I'll paste below:

For men, cloaks began to go out of fashion in the eighteenth century for everyday cold-weather wear, as they were replaced by the greatcoat. The greatcoat, originally associated with coachmen, was a loosely-cut garment that could fit over the ordinary coat (worn on an everyday basis, rather than for cold weather specifically - think of a suit coat), and had a collar and/or capelet or multiple capelets sewn to the neckline for further protection. It seems to have entered the fashionable world around the same time that English country dress was becoming something to mimic, in the late 1770s and 1780s. Silk or fine wool cloaks were sometimes worn by very wealthy men as part of ultra-formal ""opera dress"" through the nineteenth century, but eventually petered out. I know that they held on to some extent in military uniforms, but certainly don't know enough about that to go into detail.

Women had fashionably worn cloaks and capes of varying cuts throughout the eighteenth century, but sleeved outer garments worn on top of gowns (spencers, short jackets; pelisses, fitted long coats; witzchouras, fur-lined coats with hoods; etc.) were picked up in the 1790s, with plain wool cloaks being left to those who couldn't afford to follow new styles, or chose not to (as with Quakers and Shakers, for instance). Unlike the situation with men, mantles and cloaks had a resurgence in fashionable women's everyday dress by the early 1830s, as their very full sleeves (often supported from inside with whalebone or crinoline) could not be stuffed into a coat. This state of affairs fluctuated back and forth through the century as women's sleeves changed shape; when they were fitted to the arm, sleeved overgarments could be worn, and when they were full, as in the mid-1890s, capes were more normal. Throughout this time, women retained the formal opera or evening cloak, which is how capes continued to be worn in the early twentieth century when they were definitely seen as old-fashioned costumes otherwise - until the return of the fashionable cold-weather cape in the 1960s, but as with uniforms, that's generally out of my lane.

You may have noticed that I never answered ""why"" this happened, as you asked. The truth is, I'm not sure I believe there is a satisfying sociological explanation for this. Fashion is a consciously manipulated and somewhat arbitrary domain: every time something fades from prominence, there's a chance it will be gone for decades or centuries, and a chance that it will rebound in a cyclical manner."

AskHistorians,Historian Pekka Hämäläinen argues that Lakota expansion ended up protecting many other Indigenous communities from colonial violence. How accepted is this view?,"I do not have my own opinion on this work, but you asked if it was a widely accepted view, and I do think I can answer that.

The answer is no. In fact, many indigenous scholars seem to think Hamalainen is a hack, without ever being so blunt about it themselves. Here is one excerpt from a review of ""Indigenous Continent"" in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2022/10/05/indigenous-continent-pekka-hamalainen-review/):

>In the stories it does tell, “Indigenous Continent” does not fully deliver upon its early promises of Indigenous power and European submission. For example, we learn that the Puritan Great Migration of the 1630s brought thousands of settlers as well as waves of pathogens to New England. Starting in 1633, “more than eighty percent of the Native Americans in the region died.” As epidemics stalked the lives of Native peoples, the region’s Wabanaki and Pequot communities nonetheless still “surrounded the New Englanders,” exacerbating tensions within Puritan society: “The Massachusetts project was fraught with ambiguity from the start. The English claimed land for a colony without Indigenous consent.” The subsequent “apocalyptic violence” of the Pequot War (1636-1637) featured “genocidal violence,” as Puritan leaders now believed that Indians remained “lesser people who needed to be destroyed to make room for a better world.” None of this suggests any degree of English supplication to Indigenous power. On the contrary, European diseases, demography and desires advanced Puritan settlement.

Hamalainen seems really hung up on binary ideas of ""weakness"" and ""strength,"" and one common criticism of his work is that he's more or less just repeating the outdated Euro-centric paradigm while dressing it up as something else. He seems to have a poor grasp of actual native culture and motivations, and doesn't seem particularly interested in differentiating between different groups or tribes beyond his so-called ""empires."" He mentions that they exist, but spends almost no time discussing them, and in fact spends way more time discussing specific colonial movements.

This criticism that he's merely repeating the standard paradigm is a common one. Here's another excerpt from a review in the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/14/do-we-have-the-history-of-native-americans-backward-indigenous-continent):

>And yet the limitations of Hämäläinen’s approach are striking, too. Despite his avowed aim to tell the story of North America from an Indigenous perspective, the main history he relates largely follows the white settlers in their movements. We get conflict zones in the Appalachians, south of the Great Lakes, in the Ohio River Valley, and, later, on the Great Plains, but in each instance Hämäläinen replicates the very thing he has said he was writing against: a fundamentally east-to-west story of European colonial expansion. Nor is the purview of “Indigenous Continent” exactly continental. Hämäläinen spends hardly any time in the Pacific Northwest or along the California coast. We learn little about the alliances and conflicts between tribal nations and the Spanish which flowed from north to south along the Rio Grande, from what is now Colorado to Mexico City. We learn little, for that matter, about the alliances and conflicts that the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had with the British and the French in what is now Canada, extending all the way north to Hudson Bay. What we get is less an “Indigenous continent” than a Native United States.

Just to really drive this point home, you'll notice that I referred to groups like the Lakota as ""so-called empires"" above. The reason for that is that many native scholars don't accept that it's correct to view native groups through that sort of European lens. From that same New Yorker review:

>The book is, at times, breathless in its exposition, and nuance is sometimes lost in the shuffle. So, too, are the attempts to include Indigenous concepts—linguistic, spiritual, cultural. Scholars will debate whether the formation and expansion of certain tribal nations are best understood in reference to European models of empire. And Hämäläinen’s eagerness to characterize the colonial slaughter of Indigenous people as evidence of fear and weakness wears thin as the tide turns, and the story of pitched battle gives way to one of systematic subjugation.

To sum it up, most scholars don't appear to take Hamalainen all that seriously. He's done a great job catching headlines and furthering his career, but his actual scholarship seems questionable at best. Again though, this is not my own expert opinion, this is merely what I've been able to gather from looking into his books and the ideas presented in them. If you google reviews of his books, you will find an awful lot of quotes that are basically the polite academic way of saying ""this is crap."" One good example comes from Ned Blackhawk in a New York Times interview:

>Blackhawk dismissed Hämäläinen as a historian of ""equestrianism"" and objected to the book's ""occasional disregard of things like law and policy, which are central to Native American sovereignty and lives.""

It's possible other indigenous scholars have a different opinion of his work. Again, I am a non-expert repeating what I found when I looked into this myself, so this is by no means a comprehensive answer as to whether or not Hamalainen is *right*, but that's not what you asked. You asked if his work was ""widely accepted,"" and I think it's fair to say the answer is no."
AskHistorians,Was the Delaware River wider or more rough in 1776 then it is now? It doesn't seem that big of a deal to cross currently. So why were the Hessian's complacent.,"Cold is somewhat understating it, I think. The river was covered in floating ice (which was apparently a major hazard for the boats), and the weather was horrible, with rain and high winds making it very difficult.  It wasn’t that they thought the river was impossible to cross (and in fact there were reports of Hessian plans to cross at the time), it was just that they didn’t expect it to be done as quietly, stealthily, and quickly as it was.

The other thing you have to consider is that this wasn’t just a matter of getting a few soldiers across - a couple of squads wouldn’t have been a major threat.  He got a big chunk of his army across (including artillery and a few days’ supplies) at night, in hurricane winds, through ice flows across the river, and got them staged well enough to offer a threat.

AskHistorians,What happened when people tore their acl’s back in mediaeval times ? Did they know how to deal with those injuries or was the person just lame forever ?,"There is always more to be said, but about five months ago I wrote [this answer](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11u8njq/blacksmiths_farmers_stonemasons_hard_labor_in_the/jcptdnq/) to a similar question, which I will quote below.

I can't answer for every place in the time period of interest, but I can answer based on human pathophysiology, human evolution, and the management of orthopedic injuries in the modern context. Lets dive in...

First, while acutely painful during the days/weeks following initial injury, a rotator cuff tear, lumbar disc herniation, or ACL rupture is not a life sentence for pain and suffering. Our body can make amazing compensations for biomechanical deficits, from building new muscle to learning new motor pathways to avoid weakness/pain. Modern professional athletes play without intact ACLs, the body can reabsorb the disc herniation, and even as relatively immobile modern humans we routinely tear, or partially tear, one of the four rotator cuff muscles. I once attended a talk by an orthopedic surgeon who said your age in years is roughly the chance you are walking around with a rotator cuff tear. We just don't know until we happen into an MRI and snap a picture. That said, there are always going to be people who can't compensate/cope with their injury, or a disc herniation impinging on a vital nerve requiring surgical intervention, but the majority of modern people heal enough to function if given time to progress out of the initial inflammatory stage.

This brings me to my second point, despite the modern Western medical focus on pain as the fifth vital sign, and an extensive pharmacopeia of pain moderating substances to avoid that uncomfortable sensation at all costs, pain and injury is a very normal part of being human. Our ancestors lived very rough and tumble lives, with bony evidence of osteoarthitic changes to major joints, healed fractures, and active infections that were with that individual until time of death even before the emergence of modern humans. Neanderthal remains from Shanidar Cave (Shanidar 1) show evidence of extensive orthopedic injuries that would have immobilized this older adult male, but he was cared for while he healed, nursed back to health, and lived many more years. There also different cultural interpretations of pain/illness. From personal experience living in modern small scale semi-foraging communities in the Amazon, pain isn't discussed as much as in the U.S. Life is absolutely hard there. You are always being eaten by some blood thirsty insect, everyone has low grade skin infections from bathing in the river, clearing land/harvest food/hunting is accompanied by cuts, bruises, and the wear and tear of carrying heavy loads, but that's just normal, everyday expectations. They absolutely take people into town for medical care after large acute injuries, but most healthcare is small scale and local.

This brings us to a third point, we are a highly social species who care for our injured, we can create a surplus of food sufficient to cover the temporary loss of an individual, and with a brain capable of remembering hundreds, if not thousands, of medicinal substances/approaches. Unfortunately, I don't know the specifics of folk medicine in Europe during the Medieval Period, but I've personally seen skeletal remains from large scale agriculturalists in the Americas with impeccable fracture healing, leaving me to guess the limb was immobilized/splinted for some time to allow for bone healing. Hopefully someone else can fill you in on that specific topic.

So, was this poor farmer with a rotator cuff or ACL tear (or some other orthopedic injury) screwed? If they could survive the initial disability during the inflammatory period, most likely relying on extensive social networks for food, and the accumulated knowledge of local healers for symptom management, they could return to work. They might need to modify how they worked (increase use their non dominant arm, invent tool modifications, adapt to a smaller range of motion, etc) but we can compensate for serious injuries if given time and care. There will always be unfortunate injuries that disable an entire limb, and we see evidence of limb atrophy in skeletal assemblages, but because these individuals lived long enough to show extensive bone modifications we know pre-modern humans can survive substantial injuries if given care through our social networks."
AskHistorians,Why did Gerald Ford pardon Robert E. Lee?,"Lee's lack of a pardon was something of an administrative oversight combined with politics, but also maybe over exaggerated. 

Per President Johnson's May 29, 1865 proclamation, Lee was required to separately apply for amnesty and citizenship. Lee complied with this, submitting his written application and oath of allegiance through General Grant in October of 1865. He in turn passed it on to Secretary of State Seward. Seward apparently had no desire to see Lee's status restored, so he allegedly separated the oath of allegiance and passed the it on to someone as a souvenir. 

However, President Johnson issued a second proclamation on July 4, 1868, again pardoning participants and removing the requirement for the oath of allegiance. It was clarified further on December 25, 1868, to be unconditional and apply to all persons who fought for the Confederacy, as long as they weren't charged with some other treasonous act. The State Department still did not act to restore Lee's citizenship, and he died on October 12, 1870. 

People wrote letters to the government constantly about Lee's pardon and citizenship, pointing out that they should be restored based on the above information. The Adjutant General's Office received so many petitions from the 1870s through 1975, that they created a separate file for petition requests and a form response letter in 1936. The letter stated, in brief, that the War Department agreed that Lee's citizenship had in effect been restored by the President's proclamation in 1868. All of these letters are available for viewing in the National Archives. 

In 1970, an archivist at the National Archives found Lee's ""misplaced"" oath of allegiance. Senator Harry Byrd, a Democrat from Virginia, spearheaded the resolution to officially pardon Lee and restore his citizenship. It passed the House 407-10 five years later. Byrd took it up as a fellow Virginian and Democrat, but it would have been easily passed by anyone. It had nothing to do with the Southern Strategy. Lee was a very popular figure nationally in the 1970's thanks to the Lost Cause mythology. President Ford signed it as it was popular, and Presidents like doing popular things that make people happy. 

Whether or not the 1975 resolution restoring Lee's citizenship and pardoning him was needed is a bit of a moot point now. Some, like the War Department, believed that Lee had already been pardoned in 1868. The grassroots movement gained traction because of the interest in Lee in the 1970s, the finding of the lost document, and because it was easy political points that cost nothing for politicians to act upon.

AskHistorians,"Lisbon / Seville were raided by Vikings in 844. Elsewhere, in the East, the Vikings were settling in what is current-day Ukraine. What was happening in Scandinavia to allow for this? And why were the Norsemen back in Roman times not doing anything remotely similar to what the Vikings did later on?","The Viking depredations on the rest of Europe were not caused by any one single factor, and certainly not due to boredom during the winter. Rather they were the result of economic opportunities that the Norsemen were able to take advantage of. This did not always take the form of raiding, as you note. Trade, mercenary service, ""colonizing"", and raiding were all essentially the same goal, economic advancement, just by different means. In many ways the Viking era was just an extension of the earlier migration period, so long as you buy into the existence and importance of relatively large scale migration in Europe from the Germanic World (and later the Slavic world). The fundamental reason behind migration is usually economic opportunity. In the late Roman world this took the form of Foederati service in the Empire, raiding into the Empire, exacting tribute from the Romans, and so on.

The viking playbook was quite similar in many ways. Norsemen exacted tribute from those they raided, a famous example is in the Viking attacks on Paris and Francia. They attacked valuable targets such as monasteries for their collections of valuable artifacts (and people). However this was not the entirety of their actions with the rest of Europe. They were hired out as mercenaries, most famously in the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire. Trade opportunities were seized, particularly in Russia and Finland, as a part of the lucrative trade with not only the Byzantine Empire but with the Muslim world as well. And as you note, colonizing efforts were launched in some areas, particularly Ireland, the Danelaw in England, Novgorod and Kiev in Russia, and Normandy in France. However there is no general consensus on the actual numbers of Scandinavian migrants who arrived in these locations. Nor is there consensus on the population make up of these areas, ie did women and children come to live in these areas or was this a male only phenomenon.

I'll unpack each of these a little.

Raiding is a pretty straightforward action. Show up in an area, take what you can in movable wealth and bring it back home. This could take the form of gold, silver, and other precious materials, slaves, and so on. These raids happened all over Western Europe, and some into the Mediterranean. The ""Great Heathen Army"" that overran England is often seen as the climax of this phase of the Viking Age. The Great Heathen Army was perfectly fine to take tribute and gifts from native Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, storied of Ragnarr Lothbrok and oaths of vengeance notwithstanding.

However this period of raiding and returning home eventually gave way to more organized efforts at conquest, such as adding England and other areas to the Norse possessions back in Scandinavia. Peter Heather argues that this was due to the increased involvement of powerful rulers in Scandinavia as opposed to just small warbands that were incapable of taking on larger realms or polities. However even in this period Scandinavia was quite a motley assortment of small polities, unification in Scandinavia would only come about towards the end of the Viking Era. This increased consolidation coincided with larger and more ambitious adventures at attempts at outright conquest. Danish conquests in England under Sweyn Forkbeard and Cnut the Great come immediately to mind in the early 11th century. This was after the period of the ""great heathen army"" and after the kingdom of Wessex had unified England. Harald Hardraade's invasion of England in 1066 also comes to mind.

Mercenary service is a little less visible in the historical record. It has a clear historical precedent however in the foederati of the late Roman Empire and the service of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes in Britain before the Anglo-Saxon conquest. The Varangian Guard of Byzantium is the most famous example and easily the most well attested mercenary group at this time. Membership in the guard was quite a prestigious, and profitable, appointment. Sagas mention the splendorous wealth of those who served in the guard and returned to Scandinavia. The Varangians supposedly had the right to carry all they could from the royal treasury upon the death of the Emperor, this is mentioned in Harald Hardraade's saga, and that would be in addition to their normal pay and plunder they would win in their involvement in Byzantine affairs.

Trade was also a part of this system. Goods from the Islamic world have cropped up in Scandinavia such as silver coins and cloth, likely through the intermediaries in Russia (also Norse dominated at this time). Peter Heather argues that Norse exploitation in Finland and Russia was another extremely profitable endeavor for Norsemen, especially in the trade of lumber and furs with the Islamic World. This Scandinavian domination of Eastern Europe eventually gave rise to the Russian states of Novgorod and Kiev.

Now there's ""colonization/migration/whatever you want to call it and this is inextricably linked with trade but I am not super familiar with the specifics of this aspect of Norse life. Norse rulers ended up in positions of power and influence in many parts of Europe that previously had little Scandinavian influence, but to what degree the Norse imposed themselves on existing frameworks and how much as their own innovation is up for debate. Certainly many of the areas that they settled were already long inhabited and involved in trade networks. Calling it a process of colonization is a little controversial, and presumes that there was an outside imposition on indigenous ways of life. This cannot be confirmed definitively and this process could have been a more migratory process with Norsemen taking advantage of economic opportunities elsewhere and locating themselves there.

In some cases the Norse simply came to dominate local politics and trade, ie Russia, Normandy, the Danelaw which indicates more of a migratory pattern than colonial. Other places they settled wholly, Iceland, the Faroes, and then there's the famous Vinland Saga. I cannot really speak to Norse involvement in Ireland or Scotland so I'll leave that for someone else to talk about. Trade in these areas was clearly quite profitable and far reaching. Silver from the Islamic world has found its way to Scandinavia, likely in exchange for lumber and furs.

Viking raids were merely one aspect of viking economic opportunism across Europe in the middle ages. This was not a case of vikings deciding they didn't liek being cold in Scandinavia so much as it was a process by which Norsemen were able to seize on opportunities that existed across Europe. This took the form not just of raiding but also mercenary service, trade, and migration/colonization. In some ways this could be seen as just a continuity of the earlier Germanic migrations that marked Late Antiquity."

AskHistorians,"Why is it that Greco-Roman statues of people look so anatomically correct, yet paintings of people from that time up to the 15th century don't?","This won’t address your question entirely, but I would like to point out that there is survivorship bias in the question of naturalistic statues versus painting. We lack any painting from the period of Ancient Greece, as the materials used in them decay much more rapidly than any sculpture, as bronze and marble are of course more durable. 

However, classical sources (both Ancient Greek and Roman) have told to us that classical painting also emphasized the same naturalism given to their statues. In Pliny the Elder’s The Natural History, chapter 36, he writes, “This last, it is said, entered into a pictorial contest with Zeuxis, who represented some grapes, painted so naturally that the birds flew towards the spot where the picture was exhibited. Parrhasius, on the other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn with such singular truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with the judgment which had been passed upon his work by the birds, haughtily demanded that the curtain should be drawn aside to let the picture be seen. Upon finding his mistake, with a great degree of ingenuous candour he admitted that he had been surpassed, for that whereas he himself had only deceived the birds, Parrhasius had deceived him, an artist.” (from the free Perseus Digital Library at Tufts)

While this contains elements of hyperbole, paintings that we are able to see corroborate the importance of naturalism in classical art. For example, the architectural fresco at the villa of P. Fannius Synistor and its emphasis on two-point perspective, and the large number of Greco-Roman Egyptian funerary art has faces painted with great accuracy.

As for the transition from naturalistic classical art to the “cartoonish” Medieval art, I would have to leave this to another person to comment, as I wouldn’t be able to pin-point any source that would live up to this sub’s standards. I highly recommend watching late Roman to early Medieval art History videos to see the gradual transition between these styles and the impact of Christianity and politics on this change, if you would like a more general knowledge. Great works to look at are The Colossus of Constantine and the Christian Catacomb frescoes in Rome. 

However, as an art historian, I have to warn that this question does reflect some issues common to people’s perception of the field. In art history, there is no “better” art, as art’s “mission” is not going to be naturalism in all periods of time. Art and its changing styles reflect current tastes, socio-economic considerations, the presence of patrons, philosophical and religious doctrines, etc. And as art historians have learned, the Byzantines and Medievals did “lose” some knowledge to an extent, but many of the choices in art that make things look strange to us have a spiritual and social rationale behind them, as opposed to a simple lack of skill. The “re-discovery” of Classical art by 15th century Italians and the ideas they established have become the throughline of artistic theory up to the 20th century and still lives on in the popular understanding of art, which of course influences how people tend to value Classical works over Medieval."

AskHistorians,History of Western folk religion: how did the idea that the dead become angels develop?,"The idea that human beings in the future kingdom of God will become spiritual beings similar or equal to angels is actually already present in the Synoptic Gospels, which were originally written in the late first century CE and are included as part of the Christian New Testament canon.

The Gospel of Mark (henceforth gMark), the earliest surviving gospel, which was most likely written sometime around 70 CE or thereabouts, portrays the Sadducees (i.e., followers of a particular sect of Second Temple Judaism who held that there is no life after death and that there will be no future general resurrection of deceased) as coming to Jesus to ask him the trick question: If a woman has had seven husbands in succession over the course of her life, all of whom have died, enabling her to remarry, to whom will she be married when God resurrects them all? Jesus replies in gMark 12:25:

>""ὅταν γὰρ ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῶσιν, οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται, ἀλλ᾽ εἰσὶν ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς.""

This means (in my own translation):

>""For, when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but rather they are like the angels in the heavens.""

The two later Synoptic Gospels of Matthew and Luke, which were both most likely written sometime between c. 75 and c. 100 CE, reproduce slightly different versions of this line. gMatthew 22:30 portrays Jesus as saying:

>""ἐν γὰρ τῇ ἀναστάσει οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τῶ οὐρανῶ εἰσιν.""

This means:

>""For, in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but rather are like the angels in heaven.""

gLuke 20:36 portrays Jesus as saying:

>""οὐδὲ γὰρ ἀποθανεῖν ἔτι δύνανται, ἰσάγγελοι γάρ εἰσιν, καὶ υἱοί εἰσιν θεοῦ, τῆς ἀναστάσεως υἱοὶ ὄντες.""

This means:

>""For they are no longer able to die, since they are equal to the angels, and they are children of God, being children of the resurrection.""

The scholar M. David Litwa in [his paper ""Equal to Angels: The Early Reception History of the Lukan ἰσάγγελοι (Luke 20:36)""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.15699/jbl.1403.2021.8) (published in 2021 in the *Journal of Biblical Literature*, 140(3), 601–622) highlights the fact that gLuke uses a different phrase to describe people in the coming kingdom of God from gMark and gMatthew. Where gMark and gMatthew have the phrase ""ὡς ἄγγελοι,"" which means ""*like* angels,"" gLuke uses the phrase ""ἰσάγγελοι,"" which means ""*equal to* the angels.""

Litwa argues convincingly that the phrase in gLuke conveys a subtly different meaning from the one conveyed in gMark and gMatthew. Where gMark and gMatthew imply that people in the kingdom of God are similar to the angels in the particular respect that they neither marry nor are given in marriage, gLuke seems to imply, more radically, that people in the kingdom of God are beings ontologically equal to angels in general and in all respects.

Regardless of whatever the original authors of these passages intended, early Christian writers in the first few centuries CE already interpreted these passages in the Synoptic Gospels to mean that Christian believers will become beings equal to angels on an ontological level in the afterlife.

Notably, the early Christian philosopher and theologian Clement of Alexandria (lived c. 150 – c. 215 CE) in his *Stromateis* 4.25 approvingly quotes the Athenian philosopher Plato (lived c. 429 – c. 347 BCE) to say that the souls of believers become like angels rapt in the perpetual contemplation of God after death. He writes, as translated by William Wilson for the Ante-Nicene Fathers series, with some edits of my own to make it more closely match the Greek:

>""Rightly, then, Plato says, 'that the man who devotes himself to the contemplation of ideas will live as a god among men; now the mind is the place of ideas, and God is mind.' He says that he who contemplates the unseen God lives as a god among men. And in the *Sophist*, Socrates calls the stranger of Elea, who was a dialectician, 'god': 'Such are the gods who, like stranger guests, frequent cities. For when the soul, rising above the sphere of generation, is by itself apart, and dwells amidst ideas,' like the *koryphaios* \[lit. ""chorus leader""\] in *Theaitetos*, now become as an angel, it will be with Christ, being rapt in contemplation, ever keeping in view the will of God.""

You may notice that all the writers I have quoted describe the souls of believers in the kingdom of God or the afterlife as being ""*like* angels"" or ""*equal to* angels,"" but none of them flat-out say that they will *be* angels. The distinction between someone becoming a being ontologically equal to an angel in the afterlife and them flat-out becoming an angel, however, is very thin and, even in antiquity, it is likely that some Christians believed that they would flat-out become angels after death."
AskHistorians,"If the genus capsicum is native to the Americas, was Indian food spicy before 1492 -- and if so, what spicy ingredients did they use?","Pungent aka ""spicy"" spices used in India since antiquity:

*Piper nigrum,* aka black pepper was extensively used in Europe and India. Ayurvedic cooking (which dates well before the Columbian exchange) lists black pepper as an ingredient.  Green peppercorns (same species, just underripe) was used in Thai cooking and remains in jungle curries.

The ingredient, piperine activates the TRPV1 receptor similarly to capascin (which is what gives *Capsicum* peppers their bite.) 

China is known for its szeuchuan peppercorns, which is a different genus altogether from either black or *capsicum* peppe*rs:   Zanthoxylum  armatum* which actually numbs the mouth. It stimulates the same receptors but also deactivates two other potassium-based ion channels.  Szcheuan peppercorns were used in Indian cooking as well, although it mainly grows in Pakistan, Nepal and as far north as Japan and Korea, it was traded south. The bark, fruit and seeds remain used medicinally as well. 

The next level of pungency:  ginger has a considerable bite, particularly fresh RAW or grated (dried ginger has much less;  pickled ginger as well, but when kept raw it can still have a considerable bite.) 

This pungency is down to gingerols, which have some chemical resemblence to piperine and capacins.  When strongly heated, gingerols can become zingerone, a less pungent compound and forms a sweet yet spicy smell, like in gingerbread.   Slight heating/dehydration can make ginger more pungent by concentrating gingerols.

India has many types of garum masalas (""warm spice blends) varying by region which characteristically lack chili altogether; black pepper, ginger, and other sweet spices (like cinnamon) are involved.  The effect can be heating on the body, rather than cooling.  

 Interestingly, mediaeval Europeans liked using lots of spices in similar black-pepper heavy blends.

Another pungent if sweet spice is cinnamon-- which has been used in Indian cooking for millennia.  It's a collective name for a few different *Cinnamomum* species and a few species of cinnamon grows in India, Sri Lanka and in neighboring regions.

Mustard is also heavily used in Indian cooking, and not just mustard seed: mustard oil extracted from the seeds of *Brassica nigra* (black mustard) is popular in Indian cooking and very tangy with a high smokepoint of 460 F.  Its pungent quality is not from erucic acid, but from  sinigrin.  

When black mustard is crushed, sinigrin is converted into  allyl isothiocyanate.  This is the same substance that horseradish and wabasi converts their compounds into!  So this has a  similar bite.  Good thing as horseradish doesn't grow well in India other than in hill stations and some northern gardens with more temperate temperatures.

Garlic and onions are also considered pungent and found in many (not all) Indian cuisines.  

Note: Ayurvedic cooking & medicine (very traditional) lists six tastes including pungent and astringent and recommends their inclusion in every meal, so there is a wide variety of pungent spices used in India, too many to list.  Not all have a ""hot"" bite, though.  Some are mainly medicinal in use. 

Radishes are an example of a pungent vegetable ( Raphanus sativus) but the pungency can go away when salted or cooked.

Hing (asafoetida) supposedly cooks to a onion-y taste  and is commonly used as a substitute for alliums, but I find it unpleasant even then. 

Turmeric ( *Curcuma longa*), a relative of ginger, has a very mild, faintly bitter & earthy taste. In tiny amounts, it's excellent for bringing out savory or sweet flavors. It's more ""dry"" than hot (it actually contains curmurcin, which is an anti-inflammatory.)

Fennel seed is also considered pungent (and used as a digestion aid aka carminative.)  And so on."

AskHistorians,Why did Hinduism survive the rule of the Indian Sultanates so much better than Buddhism?,"The first issue that is important to understand here is that the role of the Indian Sultanates in the decline of Buddhism in India has been greatly exaggerated. As Romila Thapar describes in her book *Somanatha*, British historians had a vested interest in producing a narrative of Indian history that reinforced the stereotype of Muslims as violent conquerers who eliminated indigenous religious institutions. This supported the British policy of divide and rule. In fact, by and large Islamic rulers in India were more than happy to patronize indigenous religious institutions so long as they were cooperative and influential. But by the time the Islamic Sultanates were coming into power, the influence of Buddhist institutions had already been waning for a very long time. 

Some of our best evidence for the decline of Buddhism comes from Chinese pilgrims in India, such as Xuanzang (602-664 CE) who visited India for 15 years or so starting around 629 during the reign of Harsha, the last major patron of Buddhism in India. Despite this patronage, Xuanzang bemoaned the state of Buddhism in India. He wrote that monasteries frequently housed far fewer monks than they had been built for, suggesting a decline in the Buddhist population. Many institutions seemed to have fallen into disrepair, and at times he reported signs of anti-Buddhist violence.

Buddhists by this time were completely dependent upon royal patronage for their survival and had lost their connection with lay peasants. Earlier in history, Buddhists interacted with lay peasants much more extensively, such as by acquiring their food through begging. With the expansion of royal patronage in India, Buddhists came to be increasingly cloistered in a sort of ivory tower environment, where they debated philosophical issues that were of little interest to the laity. Jains and what we would now call Hindus maintained their connection to the peasantry much more effectively by providing them with ritual services and involving themselves in popular grassroots movements. Since royalty patronizes religious institutions as a way to legitimize their dynasty in the eyes of their subjects, the support network for Buddhism in India grew very tenuous, as did the pool of potential converts who might refresh the monastic population.

For a more detailed discussion of the decline of Buddhism in India and the role of Muslims, Brahmins, etc. in this process, you might look at:

AskHistorians,Writings about the Egyptian Afterlife seem to focus on the rich and powerful with expensive funerals. What was believed to be the fate of peasants who couldn't afford all this?,"As with many other religions, the fate of rich and poor was believed to be generally the same after death, contingent upon the judgment of their actions during life. The afterlife for the Egyptians was viewed as a repetition of life, in accordance with the complementary cyclical and linear Egyptian views of eternity; the reason rich people needed all the fancy stuff they were buried with was so they were equipped to live this repetition after death as well. Complementary to this was a desire to have yourself prayed to/for after death, in order that the gods look more favourably upon you: tombs were not just tombs, but sites of worship at which people could make offerings and a prayer in return for the deceased’s continued help in the world of the living. This obviously gave an advantage to the richest people, who could build bigger tombs and mortuary temples that would attract more worshippers and therefore offerings and prayers; a poor person could probably depend on only their family and immediate community for this, but the principle was the same. But again, this was contingent on passing judgment – if you had lived an evil life, no amount of riches would help overcome the essential truth of your existence. 

This question did, however, press on the Egyptians, because at its heart is the perpetual worry that we will be condemned after death, and so seek reassurances that issues we have no control over (e.g. accruing wealth) will not affect this. And this question is the central issue for the first third of an Egyptian story (helpfully called ‘Setne 2’); this was written around the mid-1st century AD, which helpfully puts it just out of reach of Christianity’s influence, though it does contain two Greek proverbial punishments (of Ocnus and Tantalus) adapted for an Egyptian context. The papyrus is fragmentary and not incredibly well-written, so I’m using Ritner’s translation here.

This part of the narrative begins when Setne-Khaemwaset, a prince of Egypt (based on a historical son of Ramesses II), hears sounds outside his window, and has a look: 

“He looked \[down from the window\] of his home, \[and he saw the cofﬁn of a rich man\] who was being carried out to the necropolis, while the wailing was \[very great ...\] and great were the honors \[...\] He looked \[again\]; he \[looked toward his\] feet, and he saw \[the corpse of a poor man being carried out of Memphis\] wrapped \[in\] a mat, while there was \[silence(?)\], with no \[one\] walking behind \[him.\]”

&#x200B;

So we have a stereotypical funeral for a rich man, and then a poor man; the rich man, we can assume, is decked out in all the typical things you would expect, properly mummified with a nice coffin, while the poor man just has a mat. Setne – who is consistently an idiot – loudly proclaims that he would rather have the funeral of the rich man; his son Siosiris, who is actually the reincarnation of an ancient magician, tells him he should want the opposite. Setne argues with him, at which point Siosiris transports them to the underworld to see what’s going on. They do a quick tour, seeing all the different areas of the afterlife and the punishments that can happen, and finally reach the judgment hall of Osiris, who is the counterpart to the living king in the afterlife. Setne witnesses a judgment in progress:

“Setna saw a rich man who was wrapped in a garment of royal linen and who was near the place where Osiris was, being of very high rank ... Si-Osire walked out before him. He said to him: ‘‘My father Setna, don’t you see / this rich man who is wrapped in a garment of royal linen and who is near the place where Osiris is? He is that poor man ... They brought him to the underworld. They measured his faults against his good deeds that he had done on earth. They found his good deeds more numerous than his faults in proportion to his span of life that Thoth wrote for him to be given to him and in proportion to his luck on earth. It was commanded before Osiris to transfer the burial equipment of that wealthy man whom you saw as they were bringing him out from Memphis and for whom the honors made were great, to that same poor man, and that he be brought in among the noble spirits as a man of god who serves Sokar-Osiris.”

&#x200B;

So the poor man gets rewarded for his virtue by having wealth given to him in the afterlife; his life in the West will reward his life in Egypt. The rich man, who was guilty of more evils than goods, is not so lucky:

“It was commanded to punish him in the West. He is \[the man whom you\] saw with the pivot of the door of the West ﬁxed in his right eye, so that they shut and open out (the doors) on his eye while his mouth is open in a loud cry.”

&#x200B;

It’s not entirely clear to me what the moral of this punishment is, or whether it applies generally to all people who fail the judgment, but the message is clear: wealth and power are of no importance in the afterlife if your actions were not deserving of them. The fate of the rich and poor was the same in the afterlife: Osiris acted as a sort of dead Egyptian Robin Hood, taking from the rich and evil to give to the poor and good, redistributing wealth to make the world of the dead a morally accurate parallel to the world of the living.

AskHistorians,"If the ancient greeks were able to calculate the circumference of the earth, how did people like Christopher Columbus think that India was closer to Spain than it actually was?","Columbus's son Fernando wrote a biography of his father and in one section specifically outlines the reasoning his father had for believing he could discover a western route to the Indies. Those five reasons are briefly:

1. The Earth is a sphere, therefore is should be possible to sail West and reach a point where ""men stood feet to feet, one against the other, at opposite ends of the earth"".

2. Evidenced by other writers and explorers, a large part of the Earth had already been explored, leaving only the area ""from the Eastern end of India... eastward to the Cape Verde and Azore Islands, the westernmost land discovered up to that time.""

3. Columbus believed that this unexplored space could not be more than a third of the total longitude of the globe. He reasoned this from the geographies of Marinus of Tyre (Roman 1st/2nd C.) that have already described ""fifteen of twenty-four hours... which the world is divided"" and did not yet reach the extent of the West (only reaching the Canary Islands, The Azores not being discovered until 120 years or more before Columbus, and Cape Verdes less than 40). This left only eight hours of the total longitude of Earth.

4. Marinus had also not reached the extent of the East, and the further the East continued the closer land would then be to the Cape Verdes islands. He found support for this from a number of ancient geographers, notably that Pliny the Elder states India is ""the third part of Earth"".

5. Citing the calculations of Alfraganus (Baghdad 9th C.), Columbus believed the circumference of the Earth was much smaller than other estimates. However, unknown to him (and also his biographer Fernando), Alfraganus's estimates used the Arab mile (>7000ft) and not the Roman mile (<5000ft). 


The point most relevant to your question is the last. By using the incorrect units, Columbus took a relatively accurate measurement of the Earth's circumference and reduced it by 30% or more. Combined with his belief that Asia was much larger than it is, left a small portion of the Earth that could be safely sailed.

AskHistorians,"In the mid 90s, an episode of The Simpsons had a fictional cartoon in it called ""Worker and Parasite"", described as ""Eastern Europe's favorite cat and mouse team"" from 1959. Is this based on anything from the time period?","The Simpsons creators (edit in reply to comment!) were drawing directly on the 1961 Croatian short *Surogat*, a cartoon for adults. In offering a similar art style as a cartoon for children, they appear to be familiar with the abstract, surrealist style and eerie score of some Eastern European children's cartoons. However, they miss the chronology and the political intent of such surrealist children's products. 

Ülo Pikkov, an animator and director himself as well as a former professor of film history, wrote [a dissertation](https://www.academia.edu/36878849/Anti_Animation_Textures_of_Eastern_European_Animated_Film) on this subject. He quotes Giannalberto Bendazzi *Animation: A World History* on what Eastern European cartoons would have actually looked like in 1958:

> For the first 15 years following World War II, animation in Eastern
Europe shared similar characteristics with 1930s Soviet animation: mainly created for children, oriented towards moral and civic teaching, and resistant to stylistic changes.

But in later decades, a surrealist tendency emerged in communist countries. Pikkov quotes J.L. Owen on the common use of surrealism in Czech and Polish animation:

> If no branch of any national cinema has ever succeeded in establishing an uncontaminated Surrealist tradition, Surrealism has nonetheless remained an enduring tendency of both Czech and Polish animation.

Why was this so common? An Estonian animator explains.

> In Priit Pärn’s words, “in Soviet animation film, adopting a surrealist point of view was a form of protest, since the authorities preferred funny films with unambiguous messages.”

During glasnost especially, the moralist rules governing animation eased in the communist bloc, permitting animators much wider creative freedom as long as they did not use cartoons for explicit agitation.

> By the second half of the 1980s, the political pressures had started to ease considerably in Estonia and, liberated from the clutches of censorship, the artists were able to enjoy more creative freedom. In 1986, on Pärn’s initiative, animation filmmakers Heiki Ernits, Rao Heidmets, Miljard Kilk, Mati Kütt, Hillar Mets, Priit Pärn, Tõnu Talivee, Riho Unt and Hardi Volmer formed the Tallinnilm Surrealists group, with Kalju Kivi and Vahur Kersna joining them at a later date. As the group included the majority of Estonian animation filmmakers of the late 1980s, the Estonian animation film of the time was decisively surrealist in nature.

So basically all the Estonian animators became surrealists. What kind of products did they create? [A film made entirely from glass shards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKthsR1Rq8g), [an animal traveling through a strangely shifting landscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raoaz0KkfE4), and [what looks like a music video for a prog rock song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRK7EPlmZh8). All of these three examples contain elements of ""Worker and Parasite"", or at least would be able to earn an appropriate reaction from Krusty the Clown.

If you look at Poland at this time, you can see a similar influence of glasnost, with [weirdly abstract and eerie animation on a children's story in this 1985 cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43SellCTuR8). And a 1989 Czech cartoon features [stop-motion body parts assembling themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1THMc9g5SaU).

In short, the Simpsons creators appear familiar with the surrealist tendency in communist bloc cartoons. But they have dated the cartoon to 1959, attributing the surrealism to post-Stalinist Communist ideology instead of as a free-spirited protest against the limitations of that ideology. Besides *Surogat* itself, a non-political cartoon made for adults, there are a few works that could have created this misconception: most notably, *Man with a Movie Camera*, a famous 1929 Soviet experimental film that just managed to beat the Stalinist censors, and *Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge*, a Soviet propaganda poster which was scarcely used in Russia but became famous in among Western artists for its fierce modernism. The fame of such works among American film school teachers may have created a misunderstanding as to the purpose of modernism and surrealism in the communist bloc.

(Side note: a 1976 Czech animation [aired on Nickelodeon in the 1980s](https://lostmediawiki.com/O_par%C3%A1div%C3%A9_Sally_aka_%22Clock_Man%22_\(found_Czech_animated_short_film;_1976\)) which caused a decade-long Internet search due to its allegedly creepy nature. But if you watch it, this animation is not yet surrealist. It displays earlier communist bloc trends of folk art and naturalistic movement, and seems to have disturbed children because of the dreamlike plot. Perhaps the setting in an Eastern European town was also jarring on American screens. Anyway, it was by clicking around YouTube after watching that lost media that I first learned about this topic.)"
AskHistorians,"Why did the Van Rensselaer family, which was once one of the most powerful families in New York, decrease in influence & power in the 19th century?","The Van Rensselaers are among the oldest European colonial families in New York, dating back to Kiliaen van Rensselaer, member of the Dutch West India Company which founded New Netherland in the 17th century. In many ways it’s actually impressive how long they were able to remain influential, their descendants still getting [prominent obituaries](https://www.nytimes.com/1934/01/21/archives/mrs-van-rensselaer-art-authority-dies-noted-critic-82-also-was.html) in the New York Times in the 20th century. I’m interested in what prompted the question, because while it’s true their influence waned, they didn’t substantially worse than other old Dutch New York families (Stuyvesants, Beekmans, Van Cortlands).

In 1630 Kiliaen was granted a ""patroonship,"" a large land grant, in an area that encompassed much of the land around present day Albany on both sides of the Hudson River. Patroonshops were part of an effort on the West India Company to bring settlers to New Netherland, although they largely failed. Van Rensselaer’s was the only one that would last more than a few years. Although Kiliaen himself never set foot on the continent, his heirs would go on to lord over the patroonship, called Rensselaerswyck, in a semi-feudal manner for the next two centuries.

I think there are two main points when discussing the family’s changing status, one general and on specific to the van Rensselaers.

The first is the reality faced by all the old ""Knickerbocker"" merchant and landowning families who had long comprised the bulk of New York's elite: industrialization. As the area industrialized, they were forced to either adapt or risk that their preeminence be challenged by newer money industrialists who were investing in things like railroads, shipbuilding, textiles, and more. I just answered a [separate question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13d7ncb/what_happened_to_new_york_city_wasps/) that touched on the way the Knickerbockers became only one part of a growing elite in New York. Some merchants were quick to adapt, like William E Dodge, who moved from metal importing to investing in mines and railroads. Others, like the Astors, were content to live off their enormous real estate holdings, though only the wealthiest families could rely on this for many generations.

The Van Rensselaers were also in the position of owning a large land area, but they didn't only stand by as things changed around them. Stephen Van Rensselaer (1764-1839) in fact recognized very early that railroads would challenge the commercial activity on the Erie Canal, becoming director of the state's first railroad, the Mohawk and Hudson, in 1831. The 1837 financial panic, caused in part by rampant speculation in railroad stocks in New York, hurt the Van Rensselaers as it did many of the region's wealthy stockholders.

This leads to the second main point: The Anti-Rent War of 1844. Upon Stephen's passing in 1839, Rensselaerswyck was passed onto his son Stephen Van Rensselaer IV. The son, in part because of the economic downturn, decided to ask for back-rents his father had declined to collect from the patroonship's tenant farmers. Taken by surprise, the farmers took up arms and demanded ownership of their land, using the rhetoric of the American Revolution tying their freedom to property rights. After several years of fighting and controversy, Stephen IV and his brother William, who had also inherited some of the land, agreed to begin selling off their holdings rather than maintain the patroonship any longer.

We can probably map the family's ""decline"" in prominence from that point on, though the later descendants continued to be powerful members of the New York elite. Relative to other Knickerbockers, it's hard to say they fared much worse. Few family fortunes can last four or more centuries even in the best of cases, if only because of the expanding number heirs to spit the inheritance. Though generations later old-money heirs often maintain their status in social circles and perhaps hold onto status symbols like an elegant home, it's not atypical for them to retain little liquid wealth. For example, we can see that one Van Rensselaer descendant, author and socialite May King Van Rensselaer, had [under $20,000](https://www.nytimes.com/1926/06/25/archives/mrs-van-rensselaer-estate-19129.html) to her name when she passed away in 1926.

AskHistorians,Is it really true that conceptualizing women's breasts as sexually attractive is (relatively) unique to the modern West?,"I can't really speak to the whole world, but with my experience studying Greece and Rome, [they absolutely viewed breasts as sexual](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26308160#metadata_info_tab_contents). Greek erotic poetry went into great detail on how they looked: the size, color, firmness, etc.

When Rufinus was describing the ideal female body, the breasts were those of Aphrodite (while the head, eyes, etc. were attributed to less attractive goddesses). This likely signifies a belief (at least in his case) that it was the most beautiful part of a woman.

There's also the old legend about the Trojan war that Menelaus was hunting down Helen to kill her for infidelity until she exposed her breasts, causing him to throw aside his sword and take her back as his wife. For unknown reasons, she's known as ""the face that launched a thousand ships"" rather than ""the breasts that dropped a single sword"".  That seems like relatively strong cultural evidence that attraction to breasts was seen as normal.

Since that only covers the male gaze, there's also a line from one of Sappho's poems:

>Where it is allowed to make this thing stand up erect, to grab the breast and touch with both hands

So we can conclude that attraction to breasts was not just limited to men.

Finally, in Roman times, in the *Ars Amatoria* (a handbook for both men and women on how to court and have sex with each other), Ovid lists off a number of unattractive traits and ways to fix them. One of these is ""Is your trouble a flat bust? Wear a good bra\*."" Given that this was a widely popular book intended to capture the popular beauty views of the day, we can conclude that larger breasts were linked to being more attractive. Ovid goes on to discuss various sexual positions based on the most attractive part of the body:

>She who has youthful thighs, and faultless breasts, the man might stand, she spread, with her body downwards.

*Ars Amatoria* also describes how Paris ""was taken to her \[Helen's\] warm breast"" in order to show how they committed adultery, connecting it once again to sex.

There's also just the fact that almost any erotic artwork in Greece or Rome which involved a woman displayed her breasts prominently. Some examples include

* Erotic pinax, cubiculum D, Villa della Farnesina, Rome
* Erotic scene, cubiculum x’, House of the Vettii, Pompeii (this one directly depicts a man groping a woman's breast during sex)
* Satyr and Maenad, House of Caecilius Jucundus, Pompei (no sex occurs, only the satyr groping a naked breast)

AskHistorians,Floating Feature: Sports,"There is a famous anecdote from the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which was celebrated in Spain.

In the last date of the group phase, one match was West Germany against Austria, and if they tied both teams would progress to the knock-out stage of the tournament.

There was no material evidence of the game being rigged, but it definitely was. Both teams did bugger all during the match, and it was evident to anyone watching that neither team had the least intention of scoring. So scandalous was it, that the crowd started booing both teams, and at some point even started shouting ""¡Que se besen, que se besen!"" (Let them kiss, let them kiss!).

The chronicle of the match on the next day did not appear in the local newspaper El Comercio in the sports section, but in the crime section, with the headline ""Estafa a 25.000 espectadores"" (25,000 spectators scammed). The article continued ""Yesterday, 22 German and Austrian subjects scammed the crowd who had attended the match in good faith"".

The game became known as La vergüenza de Gijón (The shame of Gijón). You cannot get a much more rigged match than when the press reports on it in the Crime section."

AskHistorians,How did professors assign readings before photocopiers and the internet?,"I am not a professor but was an undergraduate at a British University in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For clarity, both photocopying and the Internet were around and used extensively. I studied Politics and Contemporary History.

Perhaps this answer will fill a gap for you, until a more authoritative response is provided. 

At the beginning of each semester, our tutor for each module provided a printed reading list and an outline of topics covered for each week of study. We would then complete (or read a goodly proportion of the) reading list through use of the university library.  There would be a mix of books and periodicals along with, depending on the topic, some primary sources - film, pamphlet, treatise, newspapers, etc.

As students, it was upon us not to lose the module handbook. The use of the library, in person, was an integral requirement of the course, and failure to read in sufficient depth and breadth could result in, ultimately, being ""sent down."" 

There were no ""Text Books"" - for politics and history, at least. I stopped using textbooks after GCSEs at the age of 16. You were expected to read a variety of scholarly books throughout the final years of school (albeit with a lot of guidance and support at school) and throughout our degree programme.

AskHistorians,"After Prohibition turned out to be a hideous mistake, did leaders of the temperance movement ever admit they were wrong?","I'm going to do my best to answer this one, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get really good coverage on this because I've traditionally studied the perspectives of the various political alliances rather than the individuals leading. But I can probably get most of the way.

Let’s start off with a bit of context. Who *were* the major players in the Temperance movement? And what were their motivations? Also, as a side note, the capital T in Temperance there is where the term teetotaler comes from. Total Temperance (or Total T) meant abstinence from all alcohol, not just from hard spirits. T-Total. Teetotaler. 

First, we have the Protestants. Pro-Temperance Protestants belonged to a variety of sects which had, for various reasons, chosen to ban alcohol for members. The Methodists, for example, were founded by a man named John Wesley. While he championed a number of concepts that made Methodism enormously unpopular among the Episcopalians and Catholics, he also argued that a Godly life was a sober life, and many Methodists of the day believed that this meant complete Temperance. However, even among the Protestant faiths assembled, many continued to use it for Communion, and others were unwilling to allow the government to deny use of wine as a sacrament, even for the hated Catholics, as they didn’t want government oversight of Christian faiths to become common. This led to the exceptions within the 18th Amendment for religious ceremony, and to the massive number of Jewish converts and new Rabbis springing up in the territories of certain organized crime, as people flocked to the loopholes.

Feminists noted that wife-beating, a serious problem for women of the era, was closely tied to alcohol use (1, 2). Drunk husbands were significantly more violent than sober, and feminists were working on the simplest human rights a person could have; the right to exist without fear of constant beatings. Susan B. Anthony is arguably the most famous Pro-Temperance advocates in history. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union was one of the strongest organizations in support of Prohibition.

Some industrialists and members of the capitalist class, such as the Rockefellers, also advocated for Prohibition, believing that alcohol was the cause of laziness, illness, and other interruptions to productivity (2). Many of these same industrialists skirted the law by buying huge stocks of liquor between the passage of the Volstead Act and its actual live date, as it only banned the manufacture, transport and sale of liquor, not the actual act of consumption. Eleanor Roosevelt was famously embarrassed at FDR’s well-stocked home bar throughout Prohibition (1). Racists and xenophobes supported Prohibition partially out of spite, believing that whites would be able to easily work around the law (2, 3).  They were generally correct, though minorities managed just fine as well. Finally, anti-corruption advocates also frequently took up the call, wishing to dismantle the backroom deals crooked politicians and machine bosses would make in saloons. The Anti-Saloon League had major overlap with organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan as well as anti-corruption advocates, and developed a wide range of strategies to advance their agenda. The ASL (now called the American Council on Addiction and Alcohol Problems) frequently took up issues near and dear to both the KKK as well as the WCTU, leading to an odd slate of lobbying efforts to attempt to solidify the big tent Prohibition built. 

Regardless, Prohibition was pretty clearly a failure at convincing people to stop drinking.

John Rockefeller Jr., a noted champion of Prohibition, wrote to the New York Times in June of 1932 (full contents of the letter [here]( https://time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rockefellerletter1937.pdf), prior to the repeal of Prohibition, to advocate for its repeal. He notes that there was a proposal for the Republican Party Platform to include advocating the repeal of Prohibition, and that he had now swung his support behind this. He also hoped the Democratic Party would raise the same standard. He continued to advocate for capital-T Temperance, but believed that Prohibition had done nothing to advance that cause, and had, in fact, damaged it. That by attempting to stop people from drinking by force, all that Prohibition had achieved was enticing more people to try it.

>When the Eighteenth Amendment was passed I earnestly hoped, with a host of advocates for temperance, that it would be generally supported by public opinion and thus the day be hastened when the value to society of men with minds and bodies free from the undermining effects of alcohol would be generally realized. That this has not been the result, but rather that drinking generally has increased; that the speakeasy has replaced the saloon, not only unit for unit, but probably two-fold if not three-fold; that a vast army of lawbreakers has been recruited and financed on a colossal scale that many of our best citizens, piqued at what they regarded as an infringement of their private rights, have openly and unabashed disregarded the Eighteenth Amendment; that as an inevitable result respect for all law has been greatly lessened; that crime has increased to an unprecedented degree - I have slowly and reluctantly come to believe.

Rockefeller goes on to discuss that he believes that lawful society has improved by removing alcohol from public spaces, but that these benefits did not outweigh the harms caused by society’s degraded belief in rule of law, and that Temperance advocates should continue to seek a way to remove alcohol from society.

Rockefeller was certainly not alone in his change of heart, but there were plenty who didn’t, and still don’t, agree with the repeal. 

The Anti-Saloon League turned from juggernaut to joke through the course of Prohibition. The KKK had been largely winding down in the early 20th century, until the silent film The Birth of a Nation released in theaters, glorifying the Klan. The initial effect was a surge for the ASL, who were tightly interwoven with various anti-immigrant groups, but as the Klan rose to prominence again, they quickly wore out their welcome. The ASL, who were publicly tied to the Klan, caught a lot of the mud the Klan caught throughout the ‘20s and lost significant influence and power, both as a result of the various failures of Prohibition as well as their association with the Klan (3). As noted above, the ASL continues in a different form today, continuing to advocate for temperance, though they lobby on most drugs now rather than just alcohol.

The Women’s Christian Temperance Union continues operations under the same name to this day, and continues to advocate for temperance. I had trouble finding a ton about their reactions, but I stumbled across [this]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-prohibition-repeal-anniversary/repeal-of-prohibition-not-cause-to-celebrate-for-everyone-idUSTRE4B368Q20081204) Reuters interview with the (then) president, Rita Wort in 2008. Wort explains that the WCTU does not view Prohibition as a failure:

>“We do not, however, think that Prohibition was a failure as does most of the rest of the world,” she explained.

>Some of the benefits she cited were studies published in the 1960s that showed wife beating and the lack of family support dropped by 82 percent, drunkenness was down 55.3 percent and assault decreased 53.1 percent while Prohibition laws were in effect.

In summary, did Prohibitionists change their tune? Many did, absolutely. Others simply lost relevance. Anti-Prohibition movements gathered more and more power as Prohibitionists lost influence or focus. The increasing influence of organized crime also intimidated many social factions to swing their support towards repeal, and once critical mass had been reached, FDR was quick to deliver a deathblow to the Volstead Act.

Everyone was basically an “amateur” at this time, not to mention the religious bent prominent in views of early archeological investigators. 

However, *“[Atwater] believed as well that savage Asian hunters had come across the Bering Strait and became the American Indians but that, prior to their arrival, gentle shepherds and farmers had emigrated to North America by the same route, after trekking through eastern Asia and Siberia from India. Atwater found a three-headed ceramic pot in a Tennessee mound that he took to represent the three main Hindu gods—“Brahma, Vishnoo, and Siva.” Probably, he guessed, the mound builders had migrated here via Alaska as early as “the days of Abraham and Lot” and worked their way slowly south, increasing in sophistication and winding up in Mexico.”*


This is the first mention I’ve read of an Asian origin for Native Americans, although it’s possible it was discussed earlier not in print. I’d also be remiss not to mention that the Bering Strait “ice free corridor” migration hypothesis is out of date and not believed to be fully accurate by most modern archeologists. I’d encourage anyone interested in these migrations to look into the coastal migration hypothesis, as well as Pre-Clovis archeological sites such as Monte Verde, Meadowcroft, Topper, Gault, and Paisley Caves.

AskHistorians,"In antiquity, only representatives from “Greek” cities were invited to participate in the Olympic Games. What defined a city as “Greek”? There were Greek colonies in France and all through Anatolia; the people of these cities spoke Greek and participated in “Greek” culture, right?","This is a fairly contested question in both ancient times and today. To give just one example of this, Macedon was famously a bit of an edge case, and there is a somewhat well known passage of Herodotus describing its contested identity in relation to the Olympic games (V.22, [translation from here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/5a*.html)):

>Now that these descendants of Perdiccas​ are Greeks, as they themselves say, I myself chance to know and will prove it in the later part of my history; and further, the Hellenodicae​ who have the ordering of the contest at Olympia determined that it is so. For when Alexander [not that Alexander!] chose to contend and entered the lists for that purpose, the Greeks who were to run against him were for barring him from the race, saying that the contest should be for Greeks and not for foreigners; but Alexander proving himself to be an Argive, he was judged to be a Greek; so he contended in the furlong race and ran a dead heat for the first place.

(I cannot actually remember if Herodotus actually does prove it in a later part of his history, if anyone more familiar with the text than I can chime in please do!)

I think that is a useful place to start because it demonstrates that, like all identities, ""Hellene"" was contestable and could be assumed or denied depending on circumstance. However, one thing that was agreed upon is that ""Greek"" was an ethnic, rather than a geographic, term, by which I mean that it was defined as a people rather than a territory. A person from Athens who moved to Egypt would still be Greek, a person from Egypt who moved to Athens would not. So the cities like Marseilles, Syracuse, and Cyrene that were outside of the core territory of Greece would still be ""Greek"" because they were founded and peopled by Greeks and they held relations to Greek mother cities. Nobody would object to somebody who held citizenship in Chersonesus (modern Crimea) competing in the Olympic Games. The flip side of course is that somebody else who lived in Chersonesus who didn't hold citizenship would not be Greek.

Of course this was *in theory*, none of these cities had the bureaucratic capability to create a real apartheid system even if they wanted to, and one could easily imagine that processes of citizenship bestowal and sheer population osmosis making these barriers a lot less rigid in practice. But the ideological component, the insistence that the Macedonian kings were descended from the Argives or that the citizens of Syracuse were descended from settlers from Corinth, was an important aspect of self definition. This is referred to as ""fictive kinship"", a sort of tautological definition in which a group is a group because they think of themselves as a group.

This is pretty weak as far as self identity goes, and indeed many Classical writers like Isocrates and Thucydides chose to define Greece as more of a cultural term (Isocrates said that Greeks were those that shared a common ""paideia"" or upbringing/education). Greek then becomes a term that does not denote a people but rather a cultural tradition, and this sense of it became foremost in the Hellenistic and especially Roman periods, when Greek states asserted political dominance of the eastern Mediterranean and, in turn, were subsumed by the Roman empire. It never entirely lost its ethnic sense--the emperor Hadrian may have loved Greek culture but he never called himself a Greek--but the border became so fluid as to be no border at all. One of the greatest Greek writers of the Roman period, the satirist Lucian, was a Syrian but also a Greek, and Apuleius, the great Latin writer and orator, described himself as Numidian and as Greek (he even claimed a descent from Athens!). All of these changes can easily be said to follow political shifts: the ""Greek"" of the world of city states loses relevance in the world of empires.

A good source on this is Jonathon Hall's *Hellenicity*, which makes a rather interesting argument that one of the driving forces in the creation of ""Greek"" identity was the games themselves and the need to define who was eligible for them."
AskHistorians,Why did most civilizations in history with access to wheat flour opt to make flatbreads whereas European breads used yeast and other cultures to create risen bread?,"You're making a couple of assumptions, so let's get these out of the way first.

1. Assumption one: ""Flatbreads are unleavened."" Not the case – not all flatbreads are unleavened (in fact, most *are* leavened). Some are unleavened, with the dough being cooked immediately after it's made, and others are leavened with sourdough starter (or today with commercial yeast), left to ferment and rise, and only then cooked or baked.
2. Tortillas are not traditionally made from wheat. ""Flour tortillas"" date to the early 1800s (after the introduction of wheat to Mesoamerica and Central America by European colonizers) but corn tortillas are much older, on the order of thousands of years. But tortillas are unleavened. They instead going through a different type of chemical processing (nixtamalization), which renders certain vitamins in the corn possible for the human body to absorb. 

Flatbreads cook more quickly than other types of bread, because they're thinner. This makes them easier to churn out when you've got a lot of people to feed. The first breads known to archaeologists date from between 14,600 and 11,600 years ago in the Levant. They were flatbreads cooked on a griddle-like surface. However, we also see evidence of conical bread from 10,000 years ago which was baked in Egypt, not in a griddle. These breads generally were leavened using a form of sourdough start, or yeast that naturally occurs during the process of fermentation. All doughs will ferment if given time before cooking.

While the earliest breads were made in griddles, eventually we start to see ovens (like this [portable oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven#/media/File:MuseAcrotiriItem160-6648-1.jpg) from the 17th century BCE, or the Roman furnus/fornax, which was probably [beehive-shaped](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/88/35/83/8835837dddee28f45b6574dafef9f37a.jpg)).

A lot of flatbreads are cooked on the griddle (like tortillas), rather than being baked in an oven. (Some, like flatbreads in the pita family, can be made either in an [oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita#/media/File:PikiWiki_Israel_30304_Events_in_Israel.jpg), or [griddled](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gyros_pita_making.jpg) on a [heated surface](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pita.jpg).)

Many flatbreads are also baked in ovens like the [tandoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandoor), an urn-shaped  oven where the bread is [slapped on the inside wall to cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonis_puri#/media/File:Traditional_georgian_bread_(tonis_puri).jpg), found all over Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia, as well as into Europe and the Caucasus. 

Further, you do actually find lots of flatbreads across Europe, including in northern Europe. For example:

* [Bannock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannock_(food)) in Scotland – a griddled unleavened bread made from oat flour
* [Lefse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefse) in Norway – a griddled leavened bread made from wheat flour
* [Rieska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_bread#Rieska) in Finland – a griddled unleavened bread made from barley flour
* [Crispbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispbread) throughout Scandinavia – leavened flatbread made from rye, barley, wheat and/or oat flour, baked in an oven

Ultimately, it's question of what people are used to, what technology they had available to them (what types of oven, specifically), and what preferences developed. But everyone initially made flatbreads, and many cultures throughout the world ended up baking inside ovens, in addition to cooking bread on griddles or hot surfaces. (And that's not even getting into steamed breads, which are primarily seen in China.)"
AskHistorians,Was sexual assault on female soldiers by their own side common during World War 2? Are there any sources documenting it?,"More can always be said, I've written on this topic before, an a broader answer about gender relations in the Red Army during the war. As such, while it isn't the sold focus of the answer, sexual assault, sexual coercion, and rape are discussed at several points and quite relevant for what you're asking here. I'll repost the older answer below:

[""Was internal fraternization accepted in the Soviet army during WW2 as portrayed in the Russian film ""Battle for Sevastopol""?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7q9en0/was_internal_fraternization_accepted_in_the/dsp44wj/)

As you're likely aware, the Red Army was by far the most extensively integrated military of World War II, gender wise, but while they may have been willing to utilize women in positions, and to a degree, unseen with other forces such as the Axis, or the Western Allies, the integration was by no means without problems, both institutional and personal. I've addressed some aspects of this before - you can find discussion of the demobilization of female Red Army personnel [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7bnoef/did_female_russian_soldiers_continue_fighting_in/dpko218/) - but sexual relations were of course a product of their presence that cannot be overlooked, and one which was certainly seen as problematic, not just due to non-consensual incidents or coercive relationships, but also those which were more mutual, such as seen in *""Battle for Sevastopol""*.

Let's start at the top first. While the women who served in combat positions - snipers, pilots, tankers, machine-gunners, etc. - are generally the best known, countless more worked in the rear, operating radios, driving vehicles, manning anti-aircraft installations, and filling the countless other support roles necessary to keep an army of millions in the field. While women, in limited capacities, were allowed in combat, more generally their utility was seen as freeing up a position to allow another man to carry a Mosin against the Hitlerites. These women, especially those who were young and attractive, were quick to come to the attention of male officers who would take them on as their mistresses, ""compensated"" with easy duties, or outright imaginary roles to simply keep them on the officer's staff. In a crude pun on the PPSh submachinegun, officers' mistresses became known as PPZh, an abbreviation of ""*pokhodno-polevye zheny*"", translated as ""*mobile/marching field wives*"", and while being attached to a specific officer offered protection from the attentions or abuse of other, often sex deprived soldiers, behind their backs they were commonly denigrated as whores and sluts, a reputation that would carry on well past the end of the war, and come to be attached to the entire female component of the Red Army. 

The practice of taking a ""PPZh"" was quite common in the officer corps, although seen as negative by the command, who of course were not immune to hypocrisy. Marshal G.K. Zhukov, Stalin's Deputy Commander, wrote harshly of the practice, while at the same time maintaining Lida (or Lidia) Zakharova as his mistress during the war, and his personal physician, although if confronted he would likely say that he didn't allow his attentions to Lida to distract from his duties, which was at the core of his criticism of officers who would prefer to cavort with women behind the lines rather than give military matters their attention. Even then, it could take quite extreme behavior before an officer was punished for flouting discipline. One such example from a report in 1943 was a Lt. Morosov who had cycled through four ""PPZhs"" in succession before eventually being demoted and kicked from the party, although only after 9 earlier reprimands, and in the end likely just as much for the abusive language he had used with party officials as for ""cohabitation with subordinates."" As the war progressed, more attention came to be paid on the practice by leadership, but it was never stamped out.

And while it should be said that it was an accommodation that some of the women were happy to agree to, or at least willingly acceded, it was exceedingly hard to put off the attentions of an interested officer, and as such some of these relationships absolutely were coercive in nature, with the women feeling there was little alternative. The aforementioned Morosov, when recruiting a new mistress, would demote any woman who refused, or else give them the absolute worst duties in the unit. These 'kept women', while on the one hand they could enjoy special privileges and shielded from the worst experiences of the war, at the same time could be subject to the very authoritarian whims of their officer. Recollecting the war, Ilya Nemanov noted that his officer's mistress, a young woman by the name of Nina, was kept isolated from contact with others, Ilya nearly being shot after socializing with her once. Although enlisted men were quite resentful and disdainful, surely some of it was sour grapes at their own deprivation of companionship, and often the most critical voices of the 'PPZh' were women themselves, especially against those who would flaunt the privileges granted them, as the female soldiers felt that it degraded the position of all women in the service - an unfortunate truth, in perception at least, as will be touched on later. Those few 'PPZh' relationships which were perceived to be ""genuine"" might be allowed a pass, but they are the minority in most recollections.

For the common soldiers on the frontlines, life was quite different. Officially at least, sexual relations were entirely forbidden, but it was only explicit about relationships with civilians, and when it came to those between soldiers, guidance was far less clear (quite possibly as commanders didn't wish to jeopardize their own arrangements). In regions near the front, civilian women were deported if there was reason to believe they were sleeping with soldiers. That of course didn't stop men when they had the chance though. The diagnosis of a STI would result in harsh punishment (for a soldier. An officer, especially with connections, was quite immune), but in practical terms it just meant diseases like syphilis went untreated and could often run rampant. For the women serving in the frontline areas, theirs was a precarious position that could run the gamut. For some at least, especially those small numbers who were combat troops, their mostly male units guarded them zealously, and within those close-knit groups, the women were often viewed as, if not asexual, at least little sisters (""sestry"" or ""sestrichki"") or daughters (""dochery"") to be protected, not sexual pursued. In what official recognition existed of women's frontline roles in the Soviet historiography, this is the exclusive picture painted, and while not a lie, certainly the rosy ideal of gender relations at the front rather than the whole picture.

Things were, of course, much more complicated than that idealized situation. Outside of the ""PPZh"" ""mistresses"", any number of circumstances happened. Within units, between the lower level soldiery, women might develop a relationship with a man in the unit. Between units, it was of course nigh impossible to stop fraternization of men with the all-woman units that might be posted in close proximity, although it of course could hamper the prospect of anything beyond a fleeting assignation. While some wanted something serious, many simply wanted a moment of intimacy, not something lasting, with such an uncertain future ahead of them anyways. Looking back on wartime 'romances', a physician (as an aside, some 40 percent of frontline doctors were female in the Red Army) Vera Ivanovna Malakhova poetically waxed *""Le­gitimate, illegitimate, it [earthly love] existed at the front, and it degraded people and elevated people and saved their lives.""* Voluntary relationships often would be remembered fondly by veterans even if the romance didn't survive the war. Years after the war Malakhova happily remembered a fellow doctor with whom she was involved who, stationed together in Stalingrad, had swum the Volga to bring her a birthday present when she was recovering from injury in a hospital on the far side. He would, sadly, die during the war, passing away in her arms. For enlisted personnel, however, any lasting relationship had to be kept, if not hidden, at least subtle, as discovery would be grounds for transfer. Most commanders, at least, would turn a blind eye to a relationship that was not flaunted.

Even a woman in the frontlines might come to the attention of an officer looking for his next ""PPZh"", but relationships were not exclusively between male officers and their female subordinates. In some cases, female officers would start relationships with their male counterparts in a unit, on something of a more equal footing - although rarely truly equal in the chauvinistic environment of the Red Army - and no more immune to the accusations of dereliction of duty either. Although they didn't maintain 'kept men', it also ought to be noted that some women, especially younger officers, mirrored their male counterparts in some regards. Some, especially those not on the front who were able to maintain some sort of social functions, would pick up male soldiers, behavior which could result in being put before a 'court of honor', but a punishment which didn't stem such behavior. Reports by political officers chalked the behavior up to a desire to not ""let go of their youth"", frankly a perfectly understandable impulse in the wartime environment, where every day might be their last. Pregnancy was an always present concern, but while severely restricted, abortions were easy to obtain in the military hospitals - although some women likely were happy to get an excuse to be sent home, although Red Army policy was to retain pregnant women in rear-line roles until they reached 7 months, to eek out as much utility as possible.

The concern that inspired the law was the fear that organized crime and other factors could and likely would influence the outcome of sporting events. The ""Black Sox scandal"" of 1919 (when bribes inspired a few players of the Chicago White Sox to throw the World Series in favor of the Cincinnati Reds) continued to reverberate through the century. Of course, there were other examples of fouled sporting events. These sorts of things were regarded as so abhorrent that most agreed that institutional gambling could have no proper place when it comes to national or collegial sports.

So why the Nevada exception? The first was the organization of the Nevada Gaming Commission in 1959. This was a response to the incursion of organized crime in Nevada gaming (legalized in 1931 in response to the Great Depression). The famed hearings of the United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce - the ""Kefauver Committee"" (1950-1951) threatened to drive a stake into the heart of the most important cornerstone of Nevada's economy. 

In response to this, Nevada instituted the most rigorous process of oversight to make certain that all Nevada gaming would be - and could be seen as - absolutely mafia-free and completely legitimate. The Nevada gaming industry correctly points out that gambling in other states (it is legal in some form in 48 states) can assume any form of legitimacy or organized theft from gamblers and can provide a backdoor to organized crime, but in Nevada that was an exacting means to prevent any attempt to hurt gamblers/tourists or any form of organized crime to operate in the shadows.

The existence of the Nevada Gaming Commission gave a means to leverage a Nevada exception. Key to the success to leverage that exception were Nevada's two senators, Richard ""Dick"" Bryan (1989-2001) and Harry Reid (1987-2017). Although Reid was early in his senatorial career (he would rise to become in influential majority leader), he had already learned to play the system. Working together, Reid and Bryan secured the votes needed to create the exception for their state, giving would be sports gamblers a secure place to place bets in a way that could serve as a national pressure valve for an activity that was not likely to be prohibited universally in any successful way."

AskHistorians,Was walking the plank an actual punishment or a fictional trope?,"Walking the plank has a very strange history behind it.  Literature wise the famously unreliable 1724 General History of the Pyrates says Roman era pirates used to make people climb a ladder that extended into the ocean.  Probably not true but this is likely the first allusion to walking the plank.  

First reported example was from a sailor who mutinied and was caught in the 1760s.  George Wood was his name, he told his priest in 1769 before his hanging that he made some officers walk the plank. Almost certainly didn't happen and he wasn't a pirate.  

There were scattered claims of slavers doing this but again cannot be substantiated.  The first appearance of the term in the directory of the vulgar tongue in 1788 says walking the plank is something mutineers do, referring to Wood and not piracy. 

It takes until the 19th century when it became a pirate staple, there actually is a reporter case in 1829 where Dutch pirates forced some sailors over the edge of the ship with cannonballs tied to the legs but this is far as I know the only real example and they themselves were probably copying what Wood had said.

Most people heard of pirates and walking the plank with the 1837 book The Pirates Own Book which was a loose adaptation of General History of the Pyrates.  The author of Own Book, Charles Ellm, features a drawing of a pirate making a sailor walk the plank.  From there its a skip and a hop to Robert Louis Stevensons Treasure Island which has Billy Bones talk about walking the plank, and artist Howard Pyle who drew this event many times.

So no, pirates didn't really do this.  Honestly pirates probably murdered less then you'd think, mostly because its a waste of time and recruiting crew from a captured ship was always preferable.  Although they most certainly did kill, especially the more violent pirates like Charles Vane or Edward Low.  Although it was often just throw someone overboard or stab them.  Occasionally you'd just maroon someone, to kill or just to remove varies.  The buccaneers in Henry Morgans time tended to torture people in rather nasty ways.


Literature and pirate history have a real symbolic history, fiction sometimes inspired real pirate action, this might be one of those examples.

AskHistorians,"What was the purpose of King Henry II purchasing 10,240 lbs of cheddar cheese in 1170 and how was it utilized in medieval England?","This specific nugget of information, which always seems to be repeated with the same specific wording and numbers - 10,240 lbs of cheddar cheese, often converted into kilograms or tons, and for a price of 1 farthing per pound - comes from Wikipedia, where it was added, without a source, way back in March 2002. It’s still in the cheddar cheese article, and it has a source now! But the source is a cheddar cheese company webpage from 2006, well after the claim was added to Wikipedia (i.e., Wikipedia’s current source is a website that itself used Wikipedia as its own source).

This factoid pretty much only appears on websites with random info about cheese, or in recently published, non-academic books (also containing random facts about cheese). It’s often accompanied by other claims, like this is the first historical mention of cheddar cheese, or that Henry himself declared it to be his favourite.

On Wikipedia this is known as “citogenesis”, and this is a beautiful example of it. Sometimes we can track down the person who added it to Wikipedia and ask them for more information, but in this case the user disappeared long ago. They weren’t an anonymous vandal though, they were an editor with a username and a history, so presumably they didn’t just make it up. Where did they get it from?

Well someone did buy that much cheese, but it was actually in 1171, and it wasn’t Henry himself. Instead it was one of his barons, Alured of Lincoln, who owned land in Somerset and Dorset in the southwest of England. He submitted his expenses to the Exchequer and they were recorded in the Pipe Roll for the 17th year of Henry II’s reign - the Pipe Rolls used regnal years rather than the calendar year, and Henry’s 17th year as king was December 19, 1170 to December 18, 1171 (he had been crowned on December 19, 1154). The record in the Pipe Rolls states only that, among other expenses, Alured bought 40 weighs (or weys) of cheese for £11 (""Et pro .xl. pensis casei .xi. libri"").

The idea that 40 weys is exactly 10,240 pounds (in weight) apparently comes from the members of the Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society in 1880, who sampled some cheese at the West Bradley Manor House near Glastonbury. The subject of Alured’s cheese purchase in 1171 was discussed:

>“As a weigh was 256 lbs., we get 10,240 lbs. at a cost of about a farthing per pound.” (p. 73)

As far as I can tell, this informal conversation from 1880 is the source for the 10,240 pounds. This was before the Pipe Roll was actually published by the Pipe Roll Society in 1893, so clearly they knew their sources.

Unfortunately the actual size of a wey could vary greatly depending on time and place. For cheese, the *Dictionary of Weights and Measures for the British Isles* lists medieval examples of 180, 182, 224, 256, 336, or even 416 pounds for one wey (p. 434). The Assize of Weights and Measures, around 1300, fixed a wey of cheese as 196 pounds, but that was often ignored for local customs that weighed cheese differently. So we don’t really have any idea how big Alured’s wey was, but 256 pounds is as good a guess as any.

The other items in Alured's account are intended for the army or navy in Ireland. The Norman kings of England claimed to be the overlords of Ireland, which was supposedly gifted to Henry II in 1155 by Pope Adrian IV (the only English pope in history). Ireland was invaded in 1170 by Richard de Clare, the Earl of Pembroke, and Henry himself arrived in 1171. So this cheese was almost certainly among the supplies for the Earl of Pembroke’s ships and troops (or Henry’s, depending on when Alured bought it).

There was a similar cheese purchase about 20 years later, when Henry’s son Richard I was preparing to go on the Third Crusade. Richard himself supplied his men with cheese from Essex, and other barons also paid for their own supplies, including cheese - the sheriff of Hampshire, for example, paid “£19 18s 1d for one hundredweight of cheese”, which is actually much more money for much less cheese, compared to Alured’s purchase. But in any case it certainly wasn’t at all unusual for a 12th-century English army to be supplied with cheese.

So, the wording of the claim in your question is a clear example of citogensis from Wikipedia. It did happen though, Alured of Lincoln was supplying the invasion of Ireland with local cheese from his estates in Somerset (or Dorset). Cheddar is in Somerset, so it has been assumed that this is the first ever mention of cheddar cheese, although the Pipe Rolls just say “cheese” in general. Alured bought 40 weys of it, and if a wey equalled 256 pounds in Somerset in 1170, then the total would certainly be 10,240 pounds, but we don't really know that for sure.

AskHistorians,"“Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink?” (The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) Did pre-industrial ships not have a still or some other system to desalinate ocean water on board? A distillery system would have been pretty compact and low tech, right?","In the time period I study, some navies did experiment with distillation systems (there's a small still aboard _HMS Victory_), but they were not particularly scalable/useful until the principle of distilling water and compressing the steam was tested, slightly before WWII. At the time of the Ancient Mariner (published in 1798 with the conceit that the mariner would have been, you know, ancient), it was much more efficient for ships to carry water with them and resupply fairly frequently at known sources of water. 

Storage was always at a premium aboard ship, and while distilling seems efficient when you're out at sea, the rough rule of thumb is that it takes an equivalent amount of fuel to distill water with your output (that is, a gallon of fresh water will take a gallon of fuel to distill). That rule of thumb relates to a liquid fuel like gasoline; wood, being less thermally efficient, would be less efficient in distilling water at that point. 

So it doesn't make a lot of sense to carry distilling equipment when ships were generally near sources of fresh water, and/or could rely on rainfall (most ship captains would collect rainwater when possible, using sails as funnels)."

AskHistorians,Would a peasant's life in 1000 A.D. be any different than in the year 1300? Would technological advancements have made any meaningful difference to the life of a common peasant? Would a peasant's living standards have been significantly better in 1300?,"In short, the answer is yes. I'm going to limit this answer to western Europe, as I am less clear about the regions beyond during this time period.

Anyways there were a variety of benefits that greatly increased the quality of life for peasants during the high middle ages, most notably a slight warming of the climate which tempered the winters and improved the growing season. This may not sound like much, but combined with the Agricultural Revolution it helped triple food production. Three field farming, where farmers would rotate crops between 3 or more fields allowed them to grow more than the previous 2 field systems that left half the land empty at any given time. Metal plows made planting much easier while windmills and waterwheels also made peasant's lives easier.

During this period manorialism (like feudalism) was worked out where peasants would work as serfs for nobles. While it gets a bad rap nowadays, it was an effective system for the time where peasants and landlords both were encouraged to increase production (for the landlords to increase wealth, for the peasants to eat more) which created abundance for both classes.

This time period also was free from any large pandemics, (until the great plague in 1347), and was relatively peaceful without Viking, Maygar, or large Muslim invasions that had plagued the previous centuries. All this combined allowed Europe's population to triple from about 20 million to around 70 million from 1000-1300.

Food surpluses also led to the Commercial Revolution, in which some of the first banks were opened and trade greatly increased. During this period there would be regular fairs where people with their surplus food could buy various trade goods from traveling merchants at set points. This increase in demand led to an increase in production, with guilds forming in new fastly growing cities to manufacture goods

All this meant peasants were better fed, had more stuff, and lived longer lives than ever before. Now this would not last, with the Great Famine in 1315, and the Great Plague in 1347 temporarily reversing those gains for the next several decades, but from 1000-1300, life definitely improved for the average peasant."

AskHistorians,"Why didn't the Donner Party just go back down the mountains to the (now) Reno, NV area to wait out the winter?","The Donner Party didn't really end up at Truckee Lake because they were intentionally looking for a spot to winter. Instead, they got trapped there due to a series of poor decisions/bad luck and were unable to turn back.

The Donner party was already running late and low on food when they reached the Sierra Nevadas, so they were desperate to get to Johnson's Ranch on the other side of the pass where they could buy more supplies. They took a few days to hunt and rest in Truckee Meadows and then began what they assumed would be a day or two of hard labor to get over the mountain pass. It usually didn't start snowing in the region seriously until early November, and the Donner party showed up in late October. Unfortunately for them, snowfall that year started about a month earlier than usual, and there was already quite a bit of snow built up on the lee side of the mountain. 

As the first part of the group went up the mountain pass for the first time, they found about four feet of powder snow. The oxen were heavily fatigued after recently crossing a desert and couldn't make headway while pulling the heavy wagons. The men spent about three days trying to cut a path up to the pass, as more and more of the party straggled into the lake area, but then another snow storm started. This snowfall lasted eight days, and everyone was too busy surviving it to think about moving.

When the first snowfall the Donner party encountered stopped, they quickly set about trying to get over the pass again. Snow was now around 10 feet deep and very powdery, and party members sunk up to their thighs with each step. A few members did manage to break a path to the peak in the week without snowfall, but it was only passable on foot, and their guide refused to go west on foot and leave the valuable pack mules behind. Without his assistance, the group's chance of making it to an inhabited area with food was low. The party turned back, hoping to try again another day, but another week of nonstop snow happened, adding six to seven additional feet of snow. By this point, they were running very low on food, yet they were so snowed in that they couldn't get back down into the safer valleys. This is when conditions really deteriorated, leading to the rest of the whole grim saga. 

So basically, the lake camp was just supposed to be a temporary base for a week or two, while they cleared a path over the mountain. The party was made up of Midwestern farmers who assumed that the first few snowfalls of the year would be light and would be followed by a long period of drier weather. However, that wasn't really true for the Sierra Nevadas, especially that year when meteorological conditions contrived to result in lengthy storms that deposited impassable powder snow on everything. And unfortunately, everyone was so disorganized and focused on protecting their personal belongings that they didn't realize the danger they were in until it was too late to get to a lower elevation. 

If you're interested in reading more about the geographical and meteorological conditions that led to the party getting trapped, I highly recommend The Indifferent Stars Above by Daniel James Brown."
AskHistorians,Could women open a bank account in the US in the 1950s?,"First off, if you've read somewhere ""it was literally illegal for a woman to get a loan
prior to 1974"", you are welcome to pitch the source away at great force. (Metaphorically, especially
if you're using your phone.) The 1974 ECOA law added enforcement mechanisms to prevent *discrimination*
with the specific language ""to require that financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of credit make that credit equally available to all creditworthy customers without regard to sex or marital status"". This was extended in 1976 to include race and age discrimination. There was never the
suggestion that women simply couldn't get a loan.

Lindy Boggs, who was on the ECOA committee, writes in her memoir that

>Representative Pat Schroeder of Colorado, who entered Congress two months before I did, applied for an American Express card in her own name and was told they would be happy to issue her a second card on her husband’s account. I think the limit was something like a thousand dollars on the second card, and Pat said, “That’s one trip to Colorado and back.” That experience involved her in the movement for equal credit opportunities for women.

>Another friend was a talented professional who, newly divorced from a senator, found herself unable to obtain credit: Everything was in her husband’s name. To lessen the shock and her anxiety as she dealt with insurance, bank accounts, the telephone listing, their child’s school enrollment, changing everything into her own name, she consulted her doctor, who prescribed a mild tranquilizer. She didn’t have the prescription filled, but an insurance company tried to deny her coverage because, it said, she was “on tranquilizers.”

Part of the motivation for the bill was hearings of National Commission on Consumer Finance in May of 1972,
which brought forth specific anecdotes of denying loans. This was followed by further studies
from organizations like Advocates for Women, The National Organization for Women, and the ACLU. To
summarize, the findings were that, at least on some occasions, all of these happened:

a.) single women had trouble obtaining a mortgage

b.) women had different standards applying for a loan

c.) women were being asked to reapply for credit upon marriage (not men)

d.) women who were married were not able to get credit in their own name

e.) women's income was not being counted in a married-couple application

f.) separated women had trouble re-establishing credit

e is particularly interesting, insofar as this was hurting both spouses in a relationship, who would normally be unable to get a loan just on the husband's salary.

None other than the president of the American Bankers Association acknowledged there was a discrimination problem.

The general attitude was concern about a woman getting pregnant, and one thing
we have documentation on is lending institutions requiring _statements about their
use of birth control_.

How widespread was the issue? This ended up being controversial even after the passage, with
some downright snide language in the decade after from economists who could not concieve of banks being
""inconsistent with profit-maximizing behavior"". In an **aggregate** sense, there's a point:
an article by Peterson (*An Investigation of Sex Discrimination in Commerical Banks' Direct Consumer Lending*) produced hard data using seven loan categories that men approval rate was the same as women, except for household good loans, where women were *more likely* to
be approved. Later studies (when considered together) put forth essentially that there
were banks that discriminated, but other banks were willing to take up the slack.

This doesn't account for all the women who had to co-sign but would not have otherwise -- that
doesn't mean there wasn't a discrimination problem! Male loans were _far_ more common. Even the 1979 study
showed that unilaterally, with males applying for ~90% of loans. Discrimination was widespread
enough for to keep the percentage of women applying for
loans down. So any analysis that just looks at loan applications is by necessity incomplete. The
technical lingo is ""application avoidance"". Unfortunately there aren't any good early-70s
studies accounting for application avoidance of women. The potential gap might be very large. 
A 1999 survery related to both race and sex found *significant* issue:

>Over the past three years, about 50 percent of firms demonstrated a need for credit, either by applying for a loan or reporting that they did not apply because they did not think they would be able to obtain credit ... Of the firms that expressed a need for credit, fully half reported that they did not apply for credit sometime within the last three years because they did not expect to be able to get credit.

and we can at least say issues amongst lending to women specifically in the early 70s had some comparison.

So to briefly summarize:

a.) yes, it was *possible* for women to get bank accounts, loans, etc.

b.) but there was discrimination, although it is hard to account for the exact degree

AskHistorians,"Kim Syok’osu, a Korean woman that converted to Christianity, said “We Choson women lived under the oppression of men for thousands of years without having our own names. . . . For fifty years, I lived without a name” What was going on in Choson Korea? Did women really not have names?","The first thing we have to get out of the way is that yes, Korean women during the Joseon dynasty did have names. Coincidentally I had my family record (jokbo) on hand and in my specific family we have recorded names for women starting in the 11th generation which lines up roughly with the reigns of Sejong and Munjong of the Joseon Dynasty. 

Second thing is that because of the non-literal nature of the statement I wanted to check the original Korean text to see if there were any translation errors (early translations of Korean are quite rough). Honestly, I thought I was going crazy. I could not find this quote even in the book that it is cited from in ‪Gender and Mission Encounters in‬ ‪Korea: New Women, Old Ways‬. I searched for the compilation and autobiography as well as the name Kim Syok’osu in Korean and I could not find anything which was disconcerting. If anyone can find the quote and send it my way that would be appreciated. But this incongruence doesn’t impact what was going on in Korea much.

So the Joseon Dynasty is unique amongst the other conventional Korean “unified” dynasties Unified Silla and Goryeo in that women were marginalized to a degree not seen in the previous kingdoms. Silla due to the bone rank system had two Queens in their own right, Seondeok and Jindeok. Goryeo women while still expected to hold traditional roles as wives and mothers had rights to property. “Filial” Piety was not reserved just for fathers but also mothers as well. This was not the case in the Joseon Dynasty. No queen would rule in their own right and what rights women did have would be stripped away.
One of the major factors in this shift between the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty is the state sponsored religion, from Buddhism to Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism inherited traditional Confucian gender roles which completely sidelined the autonomy and agency of women.

By the time Kim Syok’osu would have converted to Christianity Korean society was heavily entrenched in Neo-Confucian ideals. Confucianism’s place in society was so high that the concept of Sojunghwa or “Little China” developed. To the Joseon Dynasty they were the true inheritors of Sinic culture and tradition as opposed to the “barbarian” Manchu. To be frank, women were straight up not valued and what value they did have was the dowry attached to them. They were alienated from their birth families after marriage, their husband could divorce them essentially at will, and to top it all off widows were expected to stay unwed. 

So while yes the quote is a hyperbole it does capture the essence of womanhood in Joseon Korea. For over 500 years the state sponsored ideology had the marginalization of women as fundamental to a well functioning society.

Edit: So I went back to the Jokbo and it was in fact not the names of the women recorded but rather the names of their husbands. Women technically had names, but in the records they were nameless.

AskHistorians,What was the Japanese public's perception of Nazi Germany's anti Semitism in the 1930-40s?,"This is in my specialization so I’m going to do my best, but keep in mind that what I’m about to provide is just one framing. There are some historians of antisemitism who describe wartime Japan as an antisemitic country, point blank. Having read primary and secondary sources at length, I feel there is a lot more nuance than that. 

In 1917, Japan intervened in the Russian Civil War. Japanese officers in Russia met with White Russian emigrés who convinced them that both communism and Western liberalism were secretly controlled by Jews in some way.  Many of Japan’s military elites had always hated Russia going back to the Russo-Japanese War and before, so the idea that the new Russia could not be trusted appealed to them. Thus, antisemitism became a sort of pet theory of a faction inside the military, which eventually coincided with the Nazi alliance in the late 1930s. (There were plenty of liberal internationalists in Japan who welcomed the Soviets and sympathized with Jewish revolutionaries and Zionists, but they were out of power by the late 1930s.)

Meanwhile, the ordinary Japanese public was completely perplexed by the concept of antisemitism, since they sincerely did not know who the Jews were and had never seen newspaper stories of Jews “controlling” anything. The average person’s foreign policy concern, if any, was probably grounded in American and British complaints about Japan's treatment of the Chinese, which in nationalist propaganda was simplified to the concept of “ABCD line” (American, British, Chinese, Dutch all collaborating against Japan). They saw these nations as big, powerful enemies acting in political and economic self-interest, needing no further explanation. When Japan’s military-linked “Jewish experts” offered rather strained conspiracy theories claiming that Jewish globalists were secretly pushing things around behind the scenes, it sounded to the public like they were hearing the tenets of a strange religion, which provided no additional value for the (simplistic) nationalist consensus on foreign affairs.

Meanwhile, the Germans attempted to push Nazi ideology into Japan in another way, through the multinational propaganda film *The Daughter of the Samurai*, released in 1937. I have not seen this film but it is apparently quite bizarre in tone, displaying images of Japan warped through the Nazi lens. This is what one Japanese reviewer wrote:

> The scenery that appeared on screen was definitely Japanese, but the way it was shown was Western (batakusai), exhibitionist, and queer. Holding up a Buddhist *manji* to resemble a Nazi swastika, he portrayed temples as if they were the sole repository of the Japanese spirit. Great Buddhist statues were treated as if they wielded an absolute power. He applied the Nazi spirit of self-sacrifice indiscriminately to the Yamato [pure Japanese] spirit ... it is Germany that is requiring this New Order … (translated in Baskett, ""All Beautiful Fascists?"" in *The Culture of Japanese Fascism*, pp. 226–8.)

So yes, for the average person in Japan, the Nazis seemed to be obtaining ""national self-determination"" through a strange ideology that seemed hard to understand in the Japanese context. They basically accepted the government's consensus that the Nazis were an ally against the “ABCD line” on one hand and Communists on the other, but antisemitism never really took off beyond a generic feeling of xenophobia. After Pearl Harbor, the big bogeymen through the end of the war were America and Britain, two colonialist ""Anglo-Saxon"" nations, as propagandists put it. This was easy to understand for the general public, and sold much better than invective against the Chinese or the Jews.

As the Second World War progressed and expanded in the 1940s, antisemitic military elites eventually split from the more violent Russian ideology, and embraced unusual local concepts of “world order” and Japanese supremacy. This meant, surprisingly, that they decided to harbor a sizable number of East European Jewish refugees in Manchuria and Shanghai. The reasons for this were complex. Some of the refugees came on passports issued by Sugihara Chiune, who was a liberal who was moved by personal conscience. When they arrived in Shanghai, they met with Inuzuka Koreshige, an ultranationalist “Jewish expert” who thought the refugees must be secretly powerful in some way. He and other officers formed a consensus that Jews should not be harmed, and this was maintained throughout the territories that Japan invaded and occupied during WW2.

After the war, Inuzuka shared his bizarre opinions on Jews with two English speakers who wrote it up as *The Fugu Plan*, Jews being in Inuzuka's mind a dangerous but delicious ""dish"" like fugu (pufferfish). However, this book is mostly Inuzuka’s own perspective on what happened. There was no “plan” and not everyone believed, as Inuzuka did, that saving Jews would give Japan financial and political power. Other military officers thought that Japan had a spiritual mission to conquer the entire world and that the Jews could convert to Japanese-ism and assist them, or more simply felt Japan had an obligation under international law to protect refugees. For a long time in Japan there was a vague belief among non-experts that Jews must be special in some way to have had the success they got as immigrants and the persecution they got under the Nazis, but this has become much less common going into the Internet age."

AskHistorians,How would my grandmother have gotten home after Auschwitz?,"Question to clarify…was she liberated from Auschwitz directly (the minority who remained behind in the hospital block?) or was she liberated from another camp after marching from Auschwitz to there? Do you know?

For example, Charlotte Delbo was an Auschwitz inmate, but was liberated from Ravensbruck and given to the Swedish Red Cross. Livia Bitton-Jackson’s last camp was a satellite camp of Dachau, and she went through the Americans. Belsen was liberated by British forces.

Her journey home would have depended very much on who had custody of her at liberation, and that will vary depending on which camp she was last in and where she was found."
AskHistorians,Up until Norway split from Denmark in 1814 were Norwegians considered to be Danes? Was it just a region like Jutland or was there a percieved otherness to them?,"Insofar as the concept of nationality existed in the early modern period, Norwegians were considered a different people to Danes. Even after Norway was turned into a province in 1537, the country and its people were considered inherently distinct. This started as a political/geographical signifier - people born and residing in the region known as Norway - but eventually became a cultural signifier inspiring agitation against Denmark and for Norwegian advancement.

Before the inception of the Kalmar Union, Denmark and Norway had already existed for centuries as separate states, and the two countries' elites had built national mythologies as part of royal consolidation efforts. After the union, the Norwegian and Danish aristocracy stayed apart. The king in Copenhagen was considered to be the king of two countries separately, although one was clearly superior.  The elites were not intermarried, and the Norwegian nobles were barred from the privileges enjoyed by their Danish counterparts. This distinction led the elites in the two countries to sponsor art and histories drawing on separate traditions, creating separate national mythologies. 

As for the common people, whether they considered themselves ""Norwegians"" is more difficult to gauge. After 1814 a popular historical tradition held that the Norwegian national identity was kept alive for 400 years by our fiercely independent peasantry. That's a little hard to evaluate, though. What is known is that Norwegian peasants were hostile to, and often sabotaged, Danish administrators. Feudalism was never meaningfully established in Norway, and farmers were never made serfs like in Denmark. There were riots and resistance to the Danish imposition of Protestantism from 1537, though this died down as we were allowed to gradually phase out folk and Catholic traditions. When students were sent abroad, the prefixes *Danus* and *Norvegus* are probably the most direct proof that there was a ""national"" distinction between the two.

The last clue is the professed attitudes of the Danish kings. In royal decrees and dispatches, the kings always recognize the fact that Norwegians had distinct characteristics that marked them as different. They were more hardy, better sailors, generally a people they wanted to keep in the union but who they did not in any way consider ""Danish."" Always the Norwegians were referred to as a clearly distinct people.

After 1537 and the abolition of the Norwegian council of state, the ""Kingdom of Norway"" ceased to exist, but due to the separate climates and histories, Norway's geographic expanse and the failure to meaningfully integrate Norwegian elites, no common identity was ever forged. 

This is mostly cribbed from [this](https://www.norgeshistorie.no/enevelde/1229-norsk-nasjonal-identitet-i-dansketida.enevelde.html) article by Øystein Rian, and  *Norsk historie 1536-1814* by Ståle Dyrvik. The former is a good read if you know Norwegian."
AskHistorians,Why did the Quakers who colonized Guana island bring slaves and cannons?,"It comes down to a misunderstanding about abolitionism, not necessarily Quakerism. Yes, Quakers were, as a group, opposed to slavery. Quakers also, as individuals and as a group, owned slaves and profited from their labor. 

But abolitionism, especially in the 18th century, came in a huge variety of forms, and some of which involved a form of benign slave-keeping that involved educating the enslaved before freeing them after a period of time. I have written previously about how the Marquis de Lafayette, himself an abolitionist, [bought a plantation in the French Caribbean and worked it with slaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/unl25f/the_american_revolutionary_war_hero_and_frenchman/i8c1th8/). The idea was that the enslaved, ripped from their homes and families and incapable of joining polite society, needed education and stewardship before it was possible for them to be freed. So Lafayette's project was to find a course in which  slavekeeping was less morally degrading, still profitable, and concluded with the manumission of educated men and women capable of living a free life. Lafayette's idea was that his example would convince other, less abolitionist-minded, slave owners to follow.

The Quaker experiment was a similar idea. Even Quakers possessed beliefs about the intellectual limitations of black people and of the possibility of violence that prevented them from advocating for mass manumission. Legal obstacles in the colonies sometimes interfered as well; a North Carolina law made manumission illegal, and so Quakers got round it by forming trusts with the church, who would then legally own the slave but keep them with few or no limitations on their freedom, until they could legally free them. Quakers all around the colonies engaged in similar work, advocating for gradual manumission, improving the lives and comfort of their enslaved workers, and engaging in political lobbying and organization toward the end of the slave trade and slavery in general. This was understood to be a long-term project, and racial fears of black violence and ideas about paternalism - in which the white race and culture acted as a sort of parent or guiding hand to black men and women - preventing the kind of militant agitation that would be the hallmark of abolition in the 1850s.

In a book about the history of Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, the Quaker abolition project was summed up thusly:

> Our Abolition Society, uniting the efforts of Friends and others, was formed in 1774, and its English counterpart, ten years later, when Clarkson and others, building on the firm foundation which Friends in England had laid, began the agitation which in but little more than twenty years forced Parliament, in 1807, to pass the first Act prohibiting the slave trade.

You can see the long eye displayed here. Quakers were interested in ending slavery, of course, but were limiting their efforts to direct action among the enslaved - providing education and allowing the enslaved to attend church, refusing to trade slaves for profit, encouraging marriage etc - and political action within the British government and the society of their local communities - advocating for reform, encouraging humane ownership, advocating for the boycott of the products of slave labor. There was a somewhat formalized system of what they termed ""apprenticeship,"" in which enslaved folks would go through a number of years of education before they were eligible for manumission. In addition, Quaker political action was a major factor in the British and American bans on the slave trade.

Slavery aside, the cannons were likely a part of the need for even Quaker men to serve in the island's militia. Several Quaker colonists were officers in the militia, and the need to protect the sugar plantations from ""maroons,"" to protect from foreign attack, and to prevent slave insurrections, was an important part of society in the Caribbean colonies.

AskHistorians,"When was stained glass developed, and why is it so closely associated with churches?","The question of development depends a lot on definition; clear glass as we know it today was actually a later development than colored glass. As an example, soda-lime glass, which is usually thought to be the first glass manufactured around 3000 BCE in Egypt, is often a greenish or brownish color. You’ve probably seen this in glass bottles today. In Europe, Roman glass production made a lot of advancements and spread the use of glass quickly between the first and fourth centuries AD, essentially beginning shortly after the Roman Empire developed. Roman glass has some stunning artistic uses of color and shape, some examples [here](https://www.timesancient.com/post/roman-glass-eastern-invention-meets-empire). Romans also began using glass in windows, but still not the highly transparent glass we mostly use today. That is to say, “stained glass” can be seen as historically the default.

As for their widespread use as art pieces, this mostly developed with the spread of the Gothic architectural style, in contrast to Romanesque. There was some use of stained glass in Romanesque churches, like St. Paul’s Monastery in Jarrow, England, founded in 686 AD. See pictures and more detail [here](https://stephenliddell.co.uk/2018/08/22/st-pauls-monastery-in-jarrow-and-the-oldest-stained-glass-window-in-the-world/). However, the Gothic style featured much more open and better-lit spaces, and this is where stained glass as a way to bring more impressive light features really came into play, as a development from earlier stained glass window features. The Benedictine abbey church of Saint-Denis in France, the first church to feature Gothic construction techniques like vaulting, also features some beautiful [stained glass windows](https://www.medart.pitt.edu/image/France/St-denis/windows/TwelfthcWindows.html) added during a reconstruction in the 1140s. From there, other churches to be constructed utilized a lot of the same techniques and, among those, were stained glass window mosaics.

So why churches? The simple answer is that churches were often among the most influential and wealthy patrons of the arts, and usually the most impressive buildings in a given area. You weren’t going to see stained glass mosaics in an everyday cottage, just like you wouldn’t find jewel encrusted ornamental swords. Many churches didn’t feature stained glass windows, but often the largest and expensively-constructed would, because they followed and played on the construction trends started by Saint-Denis. Those churches would also have plenty of other artistic works and impressive features of construction (the aforementioned vaulting, as an example)."
AskHistorians,Is Dracula really inspired by Vlad The Impaler?,"The idea that the fictional Dracula is based directly on Vlad the Impaler was popularized by Radu Florescu and Raymond T. McNally, in their 1973 book *In Search of Dracula: A True History of Dracula and Vampire Legends*. Florescu and McNally were respected scholars who dedicated much of their careers to studying *Dracula*, so while there's plenty of room to disagree with their findings (and plenty of scholars who *do* disagree), we can't say with confidence that the character ""actually wasn't"" inspired by Vlad the Impaler.

The name ""Dracula"" is itself a direct connection, if not to Vlad the Impaler himself, then to his lineage. Vlad's full name was Vlad III Draculae, meaning that he belonged to the House of Draculesti--a royal family that held power in Romania from the 15th-17th centuries.

In the opening section of *Dracula*, the narrator is summoned to an old castle in a remote region of Romania, to meet with a count who goes by Count Dracula, two centuries after the Dracul family last held power. At this point, it's worth noting that ""former nobility in a decaying mansion"" is a common literary trope--think *The Fall of the House of Usher*, *Sunset Boulevard*, *Citizen Kane*, or *Beauty and the Beast*. So, if you're reading the book in the late 19th century, with no knowledge of the vampire lore that would stem from it, you'd likely expect that the Count is a descendant of the Dracul family, holed up in his castle.

Of course, as the story goes on, we start to get hints that the Count is much older than that.

> I have had along talk with the Count. I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all... Whenever he spoke of his house he always said, ""we,"" and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. [pg. 24].

The next page gives us a more direct reference to Vlad the Impaler:

> Who was it but one of my one race who as Voivode [a military governor] crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! [pg. 25].

From this, my own understanding is that Count Dracula isn't intended to *be* Vlad the Impaler, kept alive as a vampire, but that he's a later, nonspecific member of the Draculesti lineage. Of course, this is still up for debate, and it's more a literary question than a historical one."
