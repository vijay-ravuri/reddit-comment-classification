NoStupidQuestions,Is it weird that my 35 year old friend is waiting for a 17 year old girl to turn 18 so he can ask her out?,"Meanwhile, in r/teenagers, there’s a 17 year old girl talking about some creepy guy twice her age asking her out."
NoStupidQuestions,"Going to jail in 7 hours, what is something I should do before I go?",Take a nice long shower. It could be 1-3 days of quarantine once you get processed in depending on how bad TB is wherever you are. Also don’t let your cellmate or anyone know when your last day is.

Here's a bit of the transcript


> The head of the Physics Department at the University of Miami.... [said] he receives one of these papers *each week*. It turns out, there is a whole community of people out there who also claim to have disproved Einstein's theory.

> So persistent are these outsiders that John Baez, a Professor of Mathematics in California, felt compelled to publish the crackpot index. It's an online quiz you can take to see if you are, by his definition, a crackpot. There are 35 items in the index, including:

*  10 points for each favorable comparison of yourself to Einstein. 

*  10 points for each claim that the theory of relativity is fundamentally misguided. 

*  **10 points for claiming that your work is on the cutting edge of a quote, ""paradigm shift.""**

*  **10 points for each statement along the lines of, I'm not good at math, but my theory is conceptually right.**"
NoStupidQuestions,Am I allowed to cut the chip off of my credit card and attach it inside of a magicians wand so I can tap it to magically complete purchases?,"Be aware that the antenna on cards is usually extremely fragile when not protected by a slab of plastic.

I did this with a transit card twice (reshaping the antenna so that it would slide into a glove), and neither attempt survived more than a day"
NoStupidQuestions,Was there really a game in the 90’s where you punch someone when you spot a Volkswagen Bug?,"Much older than the 90s. In the 60s in the Rust Belt it was ""Punchbug""."
NoStupidQuestions,Don't put metal in a microwave. Don't mix bleach and ammonia. What are some other examples of life-saving tips that a potentially uninformed person wouldn't be aware of?,"Don't throw water at a grease fire, it'll make it much worse."
NoStupidQuestions,"In Texas a fetus is now considered a person. Since this is the case wouldn't imprisoning a pregnant woman be considered ""illegal detention"" of the fetus?","No clue, it’s one of those tricky scenarios, it’s the same as the situation where a Texas woman said that she was carpooling since her child was considered a human, and could be in the HOV lane [here’s the source](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/07/11/us/pregnant-woman-hov-lane/index.html)"
NoStupidQuestions,"Americans, why is tipping proportional to the bill? Is there extra work in making a $60 steak over a $20 steak at the same restaurant?","the question I have is this one, and I legitimately ask out of ignorance.

 I understand that waiters can make 2.13 an hour because they are expected to get tips. But aren't businesses legally mandated to pay up to minimum wage if the tip doesn't meet or exceed that? Why is everyone saying if you don't tip your costing the waiver their pay ?"
NoStupidQuestions,Someone please help me understand my trans child.,"You're a good mom.  You're trying.  That's 13439835% more than a lot of moms do.  


I say this as a gay man who is no stranger to the mental health struggle, your kid needs therapy NOW.  It looks like on top of struggling with their identity (In a world that is constantly telling teens what they should be or how they should identify) they are also going through some pretty serious self hatred and are feeling very untethered.   


Make sure that while you're being supportive, you're also maintaining boundaries and structure.  Kids LIKE boundaries and structure, even if they don't know it.  Out of bed at the same time, back in bed at the same time, eating regularly, homework done on time, some sort of physical activity every day.  


They will hate you for it now, but they'll thank you for it later.  My mom was confused by my situation, so she just let go.  And I blew away.  I wish someone would have helped me stay grounded."
NoStupidQuestions,"We found out my soon to be son is going to have Down syndrome and 2 other health abnormalities, I would like to terminate the pregnancy(I know I’m terrible) and try again, my significant other wants to continue, we are seeking out a counselor, how do I get past this?",As someone who study childhood psychology if you are not both 100% onboard you will not be able to handle raising a special needs child together. It will be a truly testing experience. Having a child and raising it right is already a hard experience to navigate so make sure you guys do talk to that professional.
NoStupidQuestions,Why does digging a hole at the beach atract guys?,We yearn for the mines.
NoStupidQuestions,Can a former skinhead reach salvation?,"Yes. I don't know what more to say than that. You're already on a good path. You can't always erase the past, all you can do is be better now."
NoStupidQuestions,"I swear to god, I have some of the worst smelling farts and shits on earth. What am I supposed to do?","I've had terrible farts most of my life that even included a fart based nickname in school. I was diagnosed with a low functioning pancreas which meant I wasn't producing enough digestive enzymes and placed on tablets for this. Apparently it's very common, but you'd only know through testing. It hasn't fully rectified my gaseous nature, but it's certainly calmed it down.

Tl:Dr go see a doctor, it could be something easily fixable

NoStupidQuestions,What does it mean when people from Canada and US say chamungus in meetings?,[removed]
NoStupidQuestions,Do you pee in the shower?,I also pee in the shower and pretend to aim like a guy lol
NoStupidQuestions,I don’t want a relationship because I love my space and freedom. I hate being single because I feel lonely and unloved. What do I want exactly?,"I feel this 100%. Before I got into my current relationship I always asked myself: am I willing to give up my personal space and time to make room for this person? Because I really liked my life the way it was. Most of the times the answer was no. Then, I found someone who I could finally answer yes. I get my own space and my own time and I still *want* to spend time with them and share my space with them.  

Best of both worlds. And we’re getting married. 

Moral of the story: keep looking, don’t lower your bar, keep doing the things you want to do, find someone who fits into what you’re looking for. Not everyone will but someone will."
NoStupidQuestions,Is it a red flag liking Andrew Tate?,"I used to like Andrew tate there were a lot of tiktoks and shorts of soundbites that made sense to me. Then I started to listen to his podcasts and other interviews and that's when I found out a lot of problematic things in his views, he has no nuance and a very rigid view of things the more I listened the more I disliked him, I soon understood his view of world is very unrealistic and childish tbh."
NoStupidQuestions,"My uncle paid me $1,000 more than I asked for, should I return the money?",">he said I low balled the contract, should have been $2,500. He called me a dumbass

Loooool

Now that's a good uncle"
NoStupidQuestions,"If someone paid you $100 an hour to stay in an empty room for 8 hours a day with nothing on you except a lunch, how long would you last?","Depends on the rules.    If I can sleep, I'll retire from that job.  
Nothing on me at all?   What about clothing?   Can I keep myself busy practicing new knots in my shoelaces or my tie?   

If I screw up, how will someone know?   Will they fire me, or can I game the system and entertain myself that way?  

In a worst case, I'd probably get through at least a week."
NoStupidQuestions,"""He gets us"" is taken over my feed",It’s a billion dollar ad by Hobby Lobby.
NoStupidQuestions,"The submarine millionaires, they're all going to die aren't they?","If they were lucky, the thing imploded and they all died instantly. If they were unlucky, they froze to death when the submarine's power failed. If they were really, really unlucky, they're still alive and they'll suffocate when the oxygen runs out."
NoStupidQuestions,How should we handle our 23 y/o son who doesn't want to work?,"This subject is very close to my heart. My daughter took 7 years post-high school to find her niche and get employed full time. She tried 1 year of college and when that didn't work out, she moved home and didn't leave. She helped around the house and what-not, but wasn't bringing in any money. She is on the autism spectrum, and was diagnosed with depression in her senior year of high school, so that did contribute to the slowness in getting her to launch.

I can't tell you how many times my mother INSISTED that I needed to throw her out! Just like that - toss her to the curb. WTF. I gave birth to this child. It is my responsibility to guide her through life. I also promised myself that my daughter wouldn't have the sort of upbringing that I did. I was forced to start working at 13 years old, and I hated it, hated my mother, hated my life. I see no reason children (under the age of 18) should be forced to work. Rant over.

What really helped my daughter was working for a temp agency. She worked different types of jobs - some for a few days or maybe even a couple of weeks. But, it meant getting up in the morning, driving to the temp agency office and waiting for work. At first she was pretty against it, but guess what - she found her place in society by trying a variety of work for daily pay. Getting paid daily can be a great incentive for some folks.

And playing video games has actually really helped with her socializing because she plays co-op games with the same group of people all the time. She has met people IRL that she first met online and formed great friendships.

I think the biggest final push that got her to start a ""normal"" full-time M-F job was wanting better computer equipment and tattoos - 2 things I refused to pay for once she turned 20 or so. We bought her a nice laptop for college, but that didn't last forever, and she wanted something more equipped for gaming. So, a job was her only way to go.

Her and I still live together. My S.O. passed away some time ago, and there wasn't any reason for her to move out. So, we found this cute twin home to rent, and we split everything 50/50 and it has been terrific.

TL:DR: My daughter didn't get a full-time job until she was in her late twenties. Before that she worked temp work on and off for about 2 years - more off than on. But cleaning toilets at the local fairgrounds in the summer, and making beds at hotels for days convinced her to find something she liked and could do 8 hours a day - 5 days a week.

Edit: Thanks for the award! So glad that so many people related to my situation. Also, my daughter now works in a pasta plant, and we have free pasta for life!"
NoStupidQuestions,"A friend said he was deathly allergic to garlic, right after eating a meal we made with a fuckload of garlic. He seems okay, should we still tell him?","Tell him.

Also, it's entirely possible that he's mistaken rather than exaggerating. Maybe the experiences that made him think he was allergic to garlic were actually triggered by a different ingredient he didn't realise was in the dish. Maybe (as others have said) his allergies have changed over time and he used to break out from a single bite, but no longer does. Maybe—and this is, sadly, not unusual—he sought help for his genuine medical issues and had the bad luck of encountering a quack who gave him the wrong answer to his problems. Maybe he did actually have symptoms in the past few days, but he misattributed it to something else and didn't tell you because he didn't realise it was your cooking. Maybe he did realise it was your cooking but he wasn't comfortable bringing it up!

Eggplants and tomatoes are both nightshade vegetables, and it's not unusual for someone to have a medical issue with nightshades as a whole rather than just one particular species. Onions and garlic are also in the same family (editing to clarify: same family as each other, not the same family as eggplant and tomatoes), so it makes sense for those reactions to go together as well."
NoStupidQuestions,I crashed at a friend’s place last night and now I’m awake and don’t know how to proceed. What’s the morning after etiquette?,"Unless you expect to hang out that day, Just leave. It's algud. I've done that many times in the past...I know I wouldn't want people hanging around all day after crashing at my place."
NoStupidQuestions,Why are soldiers subject to court martials for cowardice but not police officers for not protecting people?,"In the military, we are subject to Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which includes more than just normal laws. 

Cheating on your spouse is illegal under UCMJ as well.

Edit: Since this blowing up, falling asleep while on watch duty during a war time is punishable by death."
NoStupidQuestions,"If inflation is 6%, why the fuck are the prices of some goods and services up 50%?","The number you’re referencing is the CPI, or Consumer Price Index. An index is composed of multiple items all of which have varying levels of price inflation, so the 6% number is a composite of all of the inflation numbers for everything in the index. Food is up a lot but other measures in the index are down so it’s only 6%.

Thank you for the two gold awards! I’m not sure this was quite that insightful of a response, but thank you nonetheless."
NoStupidQuestions,My closest friend of 40 years has blocked me from any and all contact with her.,"Not me, my wife and Not over politics but yes. A long-time friend of my wife stops talking to her because I didn't let him take advantage of us. He basically tried to con my wife into buying a $10k car that needed a TON of repairs. I told him I was going to take it to a mechanic and when I did and the mechanic recommended not buying it, he got all sorts of defensive and just stopped talking to her. 

&#x200B;

Took her a good year to get over it. I supported her and kept telling her ""He's the one who tried to cheat us. \*You\* should be upset not him."" But it still took a long time to get over the loss of friendship."
NoStupidQuestions,"I have a conservative friend who asked if I knew anyone I could set him up on a date with, as he told me he hasn't been having any luck in a while. Should I tell him that his personal views are a huge turn off for most women of our age/generation?","There are a ton of conservative women, but if you’ll permit a generalization, chicks don’t like downers. His problem isn’t his beliefs, it’s his making them his identity and also having a depressive spiral about perceived setbacks. He’s living in the politics equivalent of a World of Warcraft Doritos filled basement."
NoStupidQuestions,"Don’t water a grease fire, don’t mess with a garage spring. What are some MORE potentially life saving tips?",Don't put your legs between the airbag and you when in the passenger seat of a car. Keep your feet in the footwell.

NoStupidQuestions,Do any of you ever google a question and add “reddit” after the question because surprisingly reddit will get you straight to the answer rather than having to go through an annoying spammy website?,"It is apparently a widely common practice.

https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying might be of interest."
NoStupidQuestions,Do most skinny people over 30 have to think about what they eat literally all the time?,"37M, yes and no. I pay attention a lot more than I used to, but i don't count calories daily. I check my weight on a scale every week. If it's up, I eat cleaner, if it's down, I eat out more or continue what I'm doing."
NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else think the 'Elf on a Shelf' thing is weird as hell?,[deleted]
NoStupidQuestions,"According to Christianity, if you don't believe in God because you were never introduced to the religion, you won't go to hell. Wouldn't this mean spreading Christianity just puts more people at risk of being sent there?",Christians are actually divided on this question.
NoStupidQuestions,Has anyone else ever heard of leaving an “example lobster” when cooking lobsters?,"When you mentioned example lobsters I imagined it was an extra lobster you make to tell if it’s done or something. The example you use to see if the rest is cooked. 

But no everything you described is batshit insane. Why go through all that effort. Why not just make another lobster"
NoStupidQuestions,Am I in a Cult? (Scientology),"Do not let anyone know about this OP. Don't let them know you have had a single thought about this. Don't act out of the ordinary at all.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do Americans kick their kids out at 18?,"Back in the day, it was seen as ""tough love"" by parents to kick their kid out at 18, especially if they were seen as a slacker, trouble maker, or burn-out. Ironically, all my friend's parents who kicked them out at 18 we're all very shitty parents, which in turn, made my old friends future shitty parents."
NoStupidQuestions,Does anyone else feel like the world/life stopped being good in approx 2017 and the worlds become a very different place since?,r/fuck2016 comes to mind. Or theories it was in 2012 when the Collider started. It is easy to pick a year and frame a narrative
NoStupidQuestions,Do men actually care about having Transgender men in their bathrooms?,"I have not once inspected, sized up, or otherwise noticed a single human in any bathroom ever i think. I kinda just keep my eyes down, walk into my stall, shit in privacy as far from everyone as i can, and leave."
NoStupidQuestions,Why aren’t bathtubs 6 feet long?,As someone who has very broad shoulders tubs feel like they're made for 5 year olds. I can never lay comfortably without pulling my shoulder together lol
NoStupidQuestions,Why does it seem like nowadays every young person has some sort of mental illness and everyone seems to be taking pills for something.,"I wouldn't say it's only young people - in New Zealand  the highest suicide rates are between 25-29, 30-34 and 80-84 (Mental Health Foundation of NZ 2019/2020) I just think younger people are *more likely* to speak up about their mental struggles than older generations.

More awareness nowadays too, these problems would've always existed but only now are they being dealt with on a larger scale. Older generations from my experience have been taught to toughen up and just deal with it rather than seek help - this is changing.

Edit: wow thanks for the awards!! Never gotten one before thank you kind people :)"
NoStupidQuestions,"""Cancel Student Debt"" is popular but why isn't ""Stop loaning high schoolers crippling amounts of debt"" talked about?","As a parent who sees the costs for college, the other aspect of this is... ""tuition"" is just one aspect.  Room and Board is one... and ""fees"" are another thing. 

""We didn't increase tuition this year!""

""please pay an additional $500 student activity fee, $350 printing fee, and $625 athletic center fee.""

""oh... I forgot, Freshman are required to pay for the full meal plan - 21 meals per week (No refunds for unused swipes)"""

Some software like Google Docs automatically takes snapshots as you write, visible through the revision history feature."
NoStupidQuestions,To American people; Is it disrespectful or rude to not stand up during the National Anthem if I'm a tourist?,"Your post made me laugh, because I have been in this exact situation, except I was an exchange student and not a tourist. We were at a basketball game at my campus, and when the National Anthem started playing I couldn't decide if I should stand up or not, and made a split second decision not to. 30 seconds and a few nasty looks later I realized I probably should have, but randomly standing up in the middle of it would have felt even more awkward, so I just sat through the whole thing. 

So if I ever happen to be in that situation again I'll just stand up, haha. But I try to view it as a learning experience, and comfort myself by thinking that nobody but me probably remembers it."

My buddy was oblivious, but I stopped us right infront of a security camera, and just chatted.

NoStupidQuestions,"If American Chinese food is not an accurate representation of what people eat in China, why are American Chinese food restaurants almost always owned by Chinese families?","Not American but it’s the same deal here in the UK. 

When I was at university one of my housemates was Chinese. On our road there was this great Chinese restaurant that was always full of actual Chinese students. 

If we went with our Chinese housemate they brought us the Chinese menu which was incredible. If we went without him they’d bring us the English menu which had all the common English versions of Chinese food they think you want. They’d always let you have the Chinese menu if you asked for it but without the Chinese housemate they would just assume us non Chinese people want the Englishified version."
NoStupidQuestions,My dad is 53 and practices basketball dribbling compulsively 4 hours per night in our basement and he doesn’t say why. Why do you think he does this?,He does it to think. Dribbling is all about muscle memory so he can do it without thinking about it.

Or does the mattress need cleaning as well?

Edit: someone else has said put a towel on the mattress, this is a good idea. And if you put a new one under the sheet, ideally on top of a plastic sheet, that will help with future accidents.

Also OP,  I'm hoping you can get support if you need it. If you are struggling with family members being unhelpful or abusive."

I used to sell Sundays at 10:30 am on Fox's NYC affiliate WNYW with a clean lead in for $25,000 each and it was my easiest sale. That means they probably rake in a good 4 or 5 times that amount. The infomercial was that vibrating lap ""exerciser."" Haha. I also sold overnight time periods for $50. That was the highest bid."
NoStupidQuestions,"Men, do you genuinely want to be woken in the middle of the night for blow jobs?",It isn’t the worst way to wake up. Personally I have a hard time getting back to sleep so I prefer to get woken up with a blowjob when it is time to get up.
NoStupidQuestions,Why is depopulating the planet (over time naturally) generally frowned upon?,"Part of the problem you'd have is the growth obligations our society is structured around.  Just look at elder care for example- there's only so many young people for every old person.  You need to keep adding more young people to keep that ratio relatively balanced, but if you stop having new kids that system collapses quickly.  Your workforce also rapidly ages as labor becomes prohibitively expensive.  

Usually your best bet for what you're shooting for is very mild growth."

NoStupidQuestions,"How do I tell people that I don’t drink alcohol at all ever, without being awkward whenever someone urges me to drink it in social gatherings","I haven’t drank in a years now. A simple no works great for me. You can share a simple sentence like ‘alcohol hasn’t been kind to me or my family, so I just don’t drink’. I feel like most would accept that, and if they don’t, maybe they’re not worth your time."
NoStupidQuestions,"If gay people can be denied service now because of the Supreme Court ruling, does that mean people can now also deny religious people service now too?","It’s not as sweeping as “gay people can be denied service”. The ruling was “a creative professional can’t be forced to do custom creative work in favor of gay marriage”. 

The ruling was very specific to the circumstances involved - that the work involved was a form of speech that goes against their views, and that it was about the message, not the type of person.

And this would not apply just to gay rights. If an atheist artist was working for commission and told to do a mural celebrating Jesus as lord, the artist can’t be forced to do that under this ruling."

NoStupidQuestions,"how come everyone seems to have ""childhood trauma"" these days?","There has been a quiet revolution in the scientific recognition of the effects of childhood trauma on chronic illness in recent years.  It happened as a result of the Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACEs) which found that childhood trauma is 1) FAR more common that had been assumed, even in relatively affluent populations, and 2) the higher the trauma ""load"" that someone carries, the greater their risk of everything ranging from (of course) depression/anxiety/substance abuse to (more surprising) chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular illness - literally every physical system - and the increase in risk due to trauma is often 200-300%.  These studies have now been replicated all over the world with similar results.

Often, people think their multiple ailments are the result of aging - but in fact they are the result of their unresolved trauma.  Conditions like fibromyalgia, TMJ, neuralgias, lower back pain, headaches/migraines, IBS, joint pain/arthritis, autoimmune conditions are very common manifestations of trauma, whether or not you are consciously thinking about it.

NoStupidQuestions,How is it possible that roughly 50% of Americans can’t read above a 6th grade level and how are 21% just flat out illiterate?,"It’s always a good idea to read a little bit about the study to really understand what the authors are saying

I don’t know specifically what study you are referring to, but I found one from the National Center for Education Statistics that has very similar findings to what you quoted.  Link is at the bottom.

Just reading through the summary, two things really stood out.

First,  “adults who were unable to participate are categorized as having low English literacy skills, as is done in international reports (OECD 2013), although no direct assessment of their skills is available.”

Of the 21% of those deemed illiterate, about 18% of those (or 4% of the total study) were unable to participate, so they were deemed illiterate even though the authors admit there was “no direct assessment of their skills”.

Perhaps this is standard practice in the field, but assuming that lack of participation equals illiterate seems like a big stretch to me.

Secondly, “non-U.S.-born adults comprise 34 percent of the population with low literacy skills, compared to 15 percent of the total population”.

A third of those deemed illiterate are not US born and presumably learning English as a second language, perhaps in adulthood.

Assuming no overlap between those two categories, over half (about 52%) of those deemed illiterate were either born outside of the US or simply didn't participate in the study.

Just reading a bit about the study, I think that this is at least partly the case of the headline being a bit misleading.  Or at the least, a case of it meaning one thing for those familiar with this area of study and another thing for those that are not.

NoStupidQuestions,"If its illegal to sell a house to your buddy for way less than what its worth because it depreciates surrounding property values, then why is the inverse of selling for way more than what your house is worth and inflating surrounding values legal?","You can sell someone a house at whatever you price you want where I am from, assuming you own it, don’t have outstanding debts with a bank aka a mortgage on the property, and the transfer follows the official channels.

NoStupidQuestions,Why is everything unsustainable now when things were easier 20 years ago?,"One possible factor. When I was working on my degrees in workforce development and organizational leadership in the late 90's-early 2000's a major topic was ""What is industry doing to face the challenge of millions of baby boomers retiring in 2019 and beyond?"" The answer was basically nothing. Corporations and state agencies should have ramped up education, training and recruiting. Those things however are a direct hit to profit, an investment in an uncertain future when the business environment placed it's focus on immediate gains. The threat was clear to business schools pre 2015, global slowdowns in productivity due to a massive unprecedented retirement wave. 2020 created a collective amnesia forgetting that we predicted this outcome long ago, chose to do nothing and now it's an ""immediate crisis"" with everyone finger pointing.

TL/DR Businesses saw the trainwreck coming and chose to do nothing so they could get bailed out by governments and taxpayers when they called it a crisis."
NoStupidQuestions,Is my wife out of line for keeping me from a bachelor party/wedding?,"Tbh even giving “because I don’t want you to” as a reason and expecting it to be the end of the conversation (in this context, at least) seems really unreasonable. As in, I wouldn’t accept that from my SO and I don’t think I would say it to them and expect it to be obeyed either without any type of discussion. I guess I can understand feeling uneasy about not knowing the type of people your SO’s friends are, but at the same time, if you trust your SO and trust them to be a good judge of character then you shouldn’t assume that their friends are ‘dangerous’ to hang out with so to speak…especially if you yourself are taking trips with people you’ve known for way less time"
NoStupidQuestions,What will 10 pushups a day do?,"YES. Actually, this will be more beneficial than trying to start a whole exercise regimen, because you'll be able to keep doing it. It's easy to talk yourself out of going to the gym for an hour, but it's hard to talk yourself out of something that's going to take less than two minutes.

But the true magic of it is that once you're doing ten push-ups every day for a week or two, you're going to feel stronger, and you're going to feel empowered because you've kept it up. So you might up that to 15 push-ups. Maybe a week later you'll decide to add a ten minute walk. That'll become easy, and it'll turn into a longer walk -- and you'll realize that this daily walk is actually doing wonders for your mental health, too. Maybe you'll want to start doing two walks a day. Or the walk will feel easy that you'll say, ""Hey, I'm going to try to jog for 30 seconds and walk the rest of the way.""

This is how genuine change happens. Small, tiny, manageable increments that you can sustain. I wish more people would preach *this* instead of big changes that are hard to stick with.

You've got this. Do those 10 push-ups. When it feels good -- and it WILL feel good -- just add a little something else."

NoStupidQuestions,Why do people go back and edit replies that have blown up as if they've won the Oscars?,"For some people who don't use Reddit much, realising a thousand people like the joke they made is quite novel.

That would be pretty huge, most people go through their lives without ever achieving that. So for people who don't have a internet centric frame of reference it does seem like a big deal."

NoStupidQuestions,Why do people declare their pronouns when it has no relevance to the activity?,"Used to do this job at college, we started every orientation by introducing ourself with our names & pronouns because it signaled to potential students that our campus was gender-fluidity friendly. It also gives enough information so you can refer to “her” at a later point and say that “she” gave you a great tour.

Edit: added in a comment below as well.

In a formal group setting like a college orientation, where you’re already asking for a persons name, age, and degree it’s easy to add in “and your preferred pronouns”.

Will most people ignore that, sure. Will those that care share theirs, absolutely. Will the one gender-fluid kid in the crowd feel incredibly welcomed being asked their pronouns for maybe the first time in their life, 100%."

I also HATE everything that normally like (hiking, camping, the outdoors), I suddenly think those things are boring and represent the end of any excitement in my life.

NoStupidQuestions,"My boyfriend revealed to me that him and his family are apart of the scientology religion, what should I do with this information?","You need to reach out to the Aftermath foundation to get some support.

Scientology isn't just an evil cult. At the early levels, they want your money, and they want to help you. Their idea of help isn't super rational, because it's faith driven. It creates a strong sense of community, though, which is very easy for people to appreciate. I mean, you have a community, you have support, and you have friends. What's not to love?

That's when the high pressure sales tactics start. Buy the next book, buy the next course. And honestly, for some people, these courses are good things. They can teach you how to organize your thoughts and feelings. Auditing even kinda looks like therapy.

As you get deeper, the pressure increases. You keep paying for more and more courses. The church encourages you to max out your credit cards and empty your savings. Pay for more books, more courses, attend more events. But you are moving up the bridge to understanding.

Eventually, your finances start to look bad. But they have an option for you! Join the Sea Org. No bills, no costs. They supply everything. You live in a community barracks, you eat at a community cafeteria, and you work for them. For the next billion years.

Your auditing is all recorded, and people know everything about you. You have to get permission to physically leave the compound. If you are trouble, you can be put in a low quality home near an unpleasant areA (on the compound) and forbidden to interact with others until you work out your problems. You are also given harsh physical labour.

If you are good, thorough, you work 18 hour days, seven days a week, for the good of all existence, for 50 dollars a week. For the rest of your life.

Medical care is forbidden. There are no sick days. Illness is caused by your failures as a spiritual being. Serious illness is treated by being locked in a cell until you realize what you did wrong and work it out in an auditing session. 

Members of the Sea Org can marry, but cannot have children without leaving the Sea Org. Remember, though, that you have no money, no savings, no safety net, and haven't been in the job market for years. How do you support a kid anyway?

So you work, and Scientology takes every penny, until you die.

Edit: thank you everyone for the awards and kind words. Also, please be aware that this is only scratching the surface, and is a reddit-sized blurb rather than a deep dive. There are good things in Scientology, especially for public members and at the introductory members. The bad stuff is usually deeper. Don't be fooled, and also don't assume all Scientology members are evil. Most are good people trying to save all sentient life from very bad things. They really do care, but don't let that get you sucked in to something dark."

NoStupidQuestions,Why is it that all the news on trans people seem to always revolve around trans-women?,"I had a conversation with an uncle (who is very conservative leaning) not long ago. He was expressing all this outrage about all the news points - sports, bathroom access, etc. - and I kept digging down to ‘but why do YOU care?’

After a time he finally admitted that the idea of a woman identifying as a man doesn’t bother him. As he put it, there’s alway been tom-boys who we’re just as tough as the guys. Then he says ‘but why would any man WANT to be a girl? Why would they want all shit that comes with that? There’s got to be something wrong with them.’ —- please keep in mind these were HIS bias, uneducated words.

To him, a woman identifying as a man was a step up. A man identifying as a woman was a step down. And he thinks it’s a choice - a choice he thinks is not just unimaginable but dumb. Why choose to be ‘lower’, or ‘weaker’, and invite problems?

When we talked further about it not being a ‘choice’ but rather who they are - which was a long conversation with lots of circular arguments - he finally landed at ‘I don’t understand it, but I guess I don’t have to because I’m not them.’ 

It was the best outcome I could hope for. I think my uncle is a prime example of how a lot of people might think. Unfortunately, many people aren’t willing to listen to their niece challenge their way of thinking for hours!

EDIT: First, I’m blown away by all the up votes. Thank you, but that wasn’t my intent.

Second, allow me to share a little background. 

My mom is the youngest of a very big family. Both her relatives and my father’s are generationally bigoted. They may do fine in the workplace or at the sportsman’s club - but among close friends and family they are pretty awful in their way of thinking. It’s a hard thing to reconcile, because they always treated me well and I know they love me. 

She raised me very differently than the rest of the family. I was exposed to all kinds of people and ideas. I learned from an early age that I couldn’t ignore the things they said that bothered me. I also couldn’t fight about it because there was no winning. So I learned to listen and question. I basically listen to their comments, then ask why, or what do they mean, or offer their thought on a scenario they may not have considered. 

It’s laborious. It takes patience and setting aside my own urge to judge. Admittedly, with my family it also takes a fair quantity of beer. But it makes for interesting conversations, less fights, and the possibility that maybe in a small way we (yes, I’ve learned a lot from these talks too) accept ideas we didn’t before we began."

Note that the nearest law enforcement for my village is about 2 hrs away. 

So if you had a hangry (hungry + angry) 800 lbs (365 kg) bear attempting to break into your home and help was 2 hrs away, wouldnt you be grateful you've got two trained adults in the house with high powered rifles/shotguns available?

NoStupidQuestions,Why were Kanye’s sponsors and partners fine with everything else he’s said recently but drew the line at anti-semitism?,"I think there are a few things fueling it.

1. A lot of the comments he made that targeted African Americans is in the context of Kanye being black himself.  Traditionally we have been more tolerant about people saying shitty things about a group they are part of rather than other groups.
2. Adidas is a German company that has its own history with Nazis during the Holocaust and is more sensitive to anti-Semitism in the modern age.  By and large Germany has been very good about owning their history and learning from it.  It's why we see no public monuments and memorabilia from that era.  Its not that they are hiding their history, they just know its not to be celebrated.  It is also why the German government tends to be very vocal against instances of holocaust denial.  
3. Kanye didn't just say a bad thing about Jewish people, he actively declared war on the Jewish People (death-con 3 or whatever).   He had multiple opportunities since to walk it  back but decided to double down on it every time.  Already we saw the impact that his comments had outside of twitter as active anti-Semitic groups have further weaponized his words.  Anti-Semitism and hate crimes have been rising and given the history of antisemitism content like this is especially alarming.
4. It's all cumulative.  As OP mentioned this is only the latest  of a repeated pattern of Kanye related shenanigans and people are getting tired of his shit.  More importantly consumers of multiple demographics are tired of him.  He is alienating potential costumers  and is bad for business.  Had this been his first offense perhaps there may have been a different response."

NoStupidQuestions,"Why in clothing stores are a lot of the female models plus sized or in all ages, but ALL the male models are super skinny and super muscular and all in their 20s or 30s?","Most major businesses advertise to a variety of body types not out of respect or care for their clientele, but for cynical capitalist reasons. Women's body positivity is a strong movement in recent times, and advertisers are learning that the market reacts poorly to conventional stereotypes surrounding beauty in advertising. So they do the bare minimum to entice these crowds like change the mannequins or hire plus sized models. There has not been a similar movement among men, at least not one as popular, and so businesses see no money incentive to change their methods."

NoStupidQuestions,Why doesn't the IRS just send you a bill stating how much you owe?,"For 90% of people this would be sufficient as most people don’t make enough money/have enough deductions to do anything other than the standard deduction.

NoStupidQuestions,When people say landlords need to be abolished who are they supposed to be replaced with?,"I lived in a co-op apartment building for 5 years. It was like a regular apartment building but no one owned it. It was run by a board comprised of residents who were elected by the other tenants. There were other outside admin people to help with accounting and stuff but there was no ""landlord"". Apartments were not priced to make profits but to provide housing. It was pretty great.

Edit to answer some questions: 

No one owned the building I lived in. It was run as a non-profit organization. Units were charged at cost and money was reinvested into the co-op and used to pay staff. Other co-ops are set up so all members have shares, so that's where those profits I guess would be going to. There was no landlord or CEO or HOA. 

I lived in Toronto, Canada 

I'm not that familiar with HOAs, but our board of directors were just regular people who lived in the building. They volunteered their time to help keep the co-op running like a co-op. 

I can't find information on who built the building I lived in but it looks like it was just an apartment building built by an architectural company. This was in 1913.

I love how interested everyone is in co-ops!"

NoStupidQuestions,"If someone is dying, what is going on in their mind?","Edit: oh my god you guys I don't even want to know how much money y'all spent on this comment. Thank you!!

Hi! I work pretty closely with palliative patients and I can tell you with 100% confidence that she knew you were there. She held on until you arrived because she wanted you there. This is so common. I've seen patients linger on for weeks, against all odds, only to pass as soon as that one specific person shows up. I've seen it happen in the reverse as well. Family sat dutifully by the bedside 24/7 so their loved one won't be alone, only to have their loved one pass in the five minute span when nobody was sitting with them. Some people prefer their privacy.

Your mom may not have been fully conscious, but dying patients often do have some level of awareness of what's going on around them. It sounds like your mother was in hospital when she passed, which likely means she was receiving medications on an hourly basis to keep her comfortable. No pain. And when you die, your hearing is one of the last senses to fade. Which means that your voice was the last your mother heard. Your voice, the voice of someone who cares so deeply for her, giving her permission to let go. That's what she needed. And she's not alone in that. Over and over again I've seen the same situation play out in families from every walk of life. This is normal. This is how it's meant to be. I promise. Dying is a very predictable, but almost magical process, if you can take yourself out of the grief for a moment and view it as something sacred. Being there with someone in their final moments is a very special honour. You got to be there for the final breath of the person who was there with you when you took your first. That's really special."

NoStupidQuestions,"Right now, Japan is experiencing its lowest birthrate in history. What happens if its population just…goes away? Obviously, even with 0 outside influence, this would take a couple hundred years at minimum. But what would happen if Japan, or any modern country, doesn’t have enough population?","Economic collapse.  And it doesn't take a 0 birth rate to do it.

The younger population works.  They produce the food, the goods that society consumes.  They also maintain the infrastructure (roads, bridges, power plants, water/sewer/power lines, etc).  They also provide services.  Preparing/serving food, retail industry, medical services, etc.

The younger population is the one that also spends the money that stimulates the economy.

As a population starts to shrink, you have a lot of people of an older, elderly age that can no longer work that still need goods and services, but with a significantly smaller employment-age group of people to support the economy, you will have problems.

Businesses will no longer be able to find workers, and will close.  Businesses will no longer sell enough goods and will close.  The overall economy will weaken.  This will cause investment markets to take massive losses.  As companies can no longer be profitable, they will start a non-stop cycle of closing stores, laying off staff, etc trying to maintain some semblance of profit, until it's no longer sustainable and they collapse.  Rural areas will be hit the hardest as they have the fewest customers/workers to begin with.  Rural communities will be abandoned by businesses, and then by people. 

With the slow collapse of the financial markets, retirement savings will dry up, and this will further reduce the spending power of the elderly, further weakening the economy.  Then the younger people will no longer see investments as a sound savings plan for retirement and will stop investing.  The rich will see the collapse and stop further investing and may even pull out of the markets if things are alarming enough.  Financial markets will hit a crisis point and basically collapse.

The government will spend an ongoing fortune to try to maintain the status-quo, but going into massive debt to prop up a failing system will eventually mean forfeiture of debt, which will stop government spending, and likely end up with massive cuts to pay and workers.  Without the government stimulus, the markets and economy will take yet another massive blow.

International corporations are the only ones that might survive.  For Japan, things like Toyota, Subaru, Sony, Honda, Yamaha will live on as they deal on a global scale.

Assuming that the entire world economy doesn't also collapse, the good news would be that this collapse would only be short term.  It won't feel short term, but on a grand scale it will be short term.  Once the glut of elderly die off, and the population stabilizes to a sustainable rate, the economy will begin to recover as it finds a new, steady, foundation to grow from.  It won't be quick, and it will take decades to do so, but a country COULD recover from such a situation."
NoStupidQuestions,Should I tell his wife?,"Your decision to make, but my ex-husband cheated on me and the only way I found out was because someone told me. And I am beyond grateful they did, because it was a risk. Got a message from someone I didn't know, apologizing because he just caught his wife cheating with my husband, he provided screenshots of their conversations. It was so sad, he found them setting up their ipad for their toddler to watch kids shows but realized his wife had her messages connected from her iphone so he saw everything. And he was kind enough to share it with me.

I had suspected my husband wasn't being honest but had no idea how far the deception went. They worked together and were away on a business trip when everything happened, but lived in different states. The day before I found out about the cheating my husband was talking to me about moving for work and he suggested a state that surprised me. Got the message and screenshots later that night and would you look at that, the woman he was cheating on me with was from that state.

That was the moment I knew I was done.

But I never would have known if her husband hadn't shared his information with me. I will always be so grateful."

I had never done that in my life, I always dolled up on dates. But it was a daytime date to the zoo, and I had decided that I was going for ME to have fun, and I didn’t really feel like caking myself up on a hot day. I was like, “Screw it. If he really likes me he won’t mind.”

It was the best date I had ever been on in my life. I was floating. My husband and I proceeded to see each other again, and on the first date after us consummating our attraction, I got into his car and said, “I’m really sorry, I didn’t get around to shaving my legs.”

He stared at me with a glint in his eye, pointed back at the door of my house and said, “Get out!” Then promptly burst into laughter.

In the city where there are a lot more people who you need to coexist with, you want the freedom to not get struck by some maniac swinging a baseball bat around.""


It's a difference in how these regions interact with government services and society in general. People living in cities are used to problems being solved collectively. Your garbage is collected by the city, you walk to the subway station on a city sidewalk, take the city run subway system to work everyday alongside a million other people, etc. I mean, even the housing is done more communally with apartments instead of large individual homes.

 In a rural area, it's very different, the government doesn't have anywhere as much of a presence in your life, public services in rural areas amount to a (maybe) paved road and the promise that if you call for help, they'll send the fire department within an hour. Problems within the community are solved on an individual level, don't own a car and need to find a way to work? I hope your neighbour can drive you or else you're walking (and there won't even be a public sidewalk for you to use!). This extends to politics, rural areas tend to prefer policies that favour individualism.

There's also the fact that cities are less homogenous which means you are exposed to a greater variety of people from a greater variety of backgrounds which encourages inclusion and tolerance."

And then things like fit and finish, they weren't paying any attention to quality production because they assumed the service center would fix after delivery using a combination of warranty service and customer goodwill as payment. Add to that the interior which they claim was minimalistic, but in reality, according to those inside Tesla that i knew, they just ran out of time. It's minimal because they had to get them on the road.



There was a time when production and service were getting on the right track, the time of Jon McNeil. But as model 3 release loomed, they found themselves in the same boat, running out of time. So McNeil left like other every other C level person because they told Elon it should be done right and Elon told them that ""good enough to drive out of the tent"" was acceptable.



So now model 3 hits and since then it's just been a revolving door of lowering standards, cost cutting, and quite frankly, apathy. 3 suffers, then Y suffers, and then your flagship S/X suffer. I've been told the early Tesla's were over engineered. I disagree, they were engineered to the point a nice car should be because they couldn't afford to have mechanical duds on delivery. But it's been a game of what can we get away with now. Look at the redesign of the Y battery. Instead of being modular, it's now part of the interior (the seats are bolted to it basically). Sure it's  easier and less costly to assemble, but literally 10x more timely/costly to service.



The supercharger network is the moat that protects the Tesla castle. To compete with them as the #1 EV maker, you have to assault that first. Well, 350kwh DC chargers are quickly becoming more prolific and more reliable (supercharger network is rock solid, fact). Now Tesla is screwed because if you already bought one and had a bad experience, you certainly aren't going to buy a second. We all grew up in families or knew families where brand loyalty was multi-generational. Not so with Tesla. You are either going back to the brand you loved that didn't make an EV before, or your are trying something new. And that will be their fall from grace, the inability to convert 1st time Tesla owners into 2nd time Tesla owners."

NoStupidQuestions,Why does a majority of Reddit hate landlords.,"I don't hate my landlady, but I've come to increasingly dislike her. Part of the reason is that over time, she has come to talk to my husband and me as if she were our boss and not people who were paying her money to occupy part of her property (we are in an in-law unit next door to her larger home). Several weeks ago, she let a friend of hers keep her dog in her back yard (which is parallel to our front door and within 15-20 feet of it) even though she knew the dog was going to be distressed and bark a lot. She e-mailed me telling me that I would be okay with this because my husband, who is a therapist doing telehealth, worked in the bedroom on the other side of our 700 sq. foot house. She didn't ask if it was okay, and she knew I spent 10 months with a neighbor on the other side with 3 dogs that barked for 12 hours a day and had misophonia as a result. She just told me this would be fine with me and gave me no choice.

I should note that we are excellent tenants. I always pay my rent 10 days early. How was that repaid? One month, I didn't notice it was the 20th, but wasn't worried because I was still way ahead of scheduled payment. She e-mailed me later on the 20th and told me she now budgeted based on our early payment and needed to know if I wasn't going to pay like clockwork on that date anymore. She is not entitled to early payment. I was just being diligent and giving myself a buffer in case I forgot to make sure I wasn't late. Now, she feels entitled to that which is ridiculous.

We are quiet, clean, and patient about repairs. How has that patience been returned? She has increasingly taken longer and ignored more repair requests. Last May, I let her know that our kitchen faucet was constantly dripping and nothing was done. In September, I let her know it was getting worse and dripping more water more rapidly. The sound of it is maddening, of course, but she suggested I just collect that water in a bucket so it didn't go to waste.

On top of that, she has started to increasingly complain about tiny things or to invent problems which are not our fault. Someone ran over a sprinkler at the far edge of her property. It is literally 2 inches from the driveway and people visit her (including her ex-husband) and drive up to her doorway (blocking the path to our car, no less, so we can't get out when her visitors do this). I gave away a portable swamp cooler and she wrote me a terse letter saying those visitors ran over her sprinkler, even though she checked it after they left and said she saw no damage to it. She insists anyone who visits us not use the driveway, yet her visitors continue to drive up to her door.

This is my first time renting from someone who lives on the same property or close by, and part of what has increasingly happened is she treats us like fleas on her back and satellites of her wants. She expects us to live 100% the way she feels we should live and doesn't want us to have any autonomy if she imagines a problem might develop for her. This includes not giving water to the deer during drought (they have visited every year since we moved here - 7 years ago) or giving cat treats to a neighbor's cat because she thinks I'm leaving food out that attracts skunks and raccoons (even though the cat eats everything and nothing is left out and those animals have always been around here). She didn't like this year that I put out a self-service Halloween candy table for kids because, when it ran out, she said they rang her doorbell (which I don't believe is true since her lights were off). She also complained bitterly a few years ago because UPS kept mistakenly leaving our packages in front of her house (we have the same address as her, ours just has an ""A"" added to the end of the house number - it's an easy mistake to make). I explained it to UPS, but the delivery people keep changing. We retrieve the packages promptly, but she is just upset we get things at all, especially around Christmas.

She has also increasingly encroached into our area of the property - putting her trash can on it instead of her own larger space, leaving a wheel barrow next to our car. I think the main issue is that landlords take your money then treat you like you're invading their space. Every year, I thank her for letting us live here and give her Christmas gifts. Early on in the pandemic, I gave her masks when no one could get their hands on any. We've been really good to her, but she just keeps getting grumpier over time. We're moving and buying our own house next year, and I can't wait to not have to be treated the way we're being treated.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do girls on dating apps have their visible age be like 27 then right underneath in their bio the first line is always ‘I’m actually 23’ I see that all the time why do that?,"If it's on Facebook dating, it's because they lied about their age when starting to use Facebook because they were too young to be allowed on Facebook if they didn't lie.

For other dating apps, they might also have started using them before they were allowed (though it's uncommon to do so 4 years before being allowed since they typically don't have other use than dating). Otherwise, they might have imported that information from another site like Facebook. Or they might have decided to lie to appear to people who have a higher age filter. Potentially, they think people looking for older girls are more looking for the same things as them.

Some guys have the same thing. You probably don't see them because you probably only match with girls."

NoStupidQuestions,Are the cops in America really as bad as what the media portrays them out to be?,"It's not all cops are bad or even a ""few bad apples."" It's the fact that it is nearly impossible to hold a bad officer accountable if they violate your rights.


Story time, about 4 years ago, I lived in an upstairs apartment, and my friend who had children came to visit. Her 5 year old son had light up shoes and thought it was fun to run around in them. However, he quickly settled down and was playing video games with the other children. This was the first and last time she ever visited me. 

About 2 or 3 in the afternoon,  my neighbors called the police because of the noise and reported that there was domestic abuse happening upstairs.

The officers violated our rights and arrested my husband. They kicked open our door, they had no warrent or probable cause so this was illegal.
 
They separated me and my friend from our children. Then they interrogated the children 5M, 7M, &7F with no social worker or parents present. (Which is Illegal). To this day, I do not know what he said or did to our children because they are traumatized by the experience. 
 
They pulled their gun on us and interrogated me and my friend, refused to let us leave, or call a lawyer. Accused us of unspeakable things, searched my home with no warrent.  
 
Eventually, they found nothing, so they arrested my husband for domestic violence (because of the neighbors' accusation) and let the rest of us go. It took 3 days and nearly a thousand dollars to bail him out of jail.

The charges were eventual dropped, but he lost his job. I could not recope the bail money. I tried to make a formal complaint against the officer since my rights were violated and I was threatened that my pursue of this would end bably for me and was basically told it was not possible because the charges were dropped. 

I still have panic attacks when people knock on my front door. I know my story is nothing compared to the innocent people who lose their lives to police in the US every day."

NoStupidQuestions,Where do I start with showing an elderly woman the internet?,"Having had to help some elderly people in my life, show her how to grocery shop from her local store online and how curbside pickup and delivery works. This goes double if she’s in an area with snow and extreme weather. I’m pretty young, but have a friend in another state who is nearly 80. There have been times he’s been sick or unsure of driving because of snow and had no clue he could have food, over the counter medication, and even Rx delivered to his home. I ordered stuff for him and had it delivered several times and he loved it. Eventually I Zoomed with him and helped him set up his own account and how to navigate the website. I feel so relieved that he knows how to do that now. My MIL also uses it now. Big relief because she never wants to “bother” anyone. She’d sooner eat saltines for dinner than ask for a favor, so now she’s empowered.

I’d also connect her with however her doctor does video chat visits. 

If she’s social, there’s probably some community centers that offer social events for seniors. She might want to bookmark them to see their calendars or sign up for emails about events.

Don’t mess with her bank accounts, but encourage her to have a family member or banker help her get set up with online banking. My MIL has found it useful to review all of her bank activity online frequently. She was scammed once and also had some subscriptions she didn’t realize were ongoing, so she feels more in control when she can see everything whenever she wants to. If anything looks suspicious she comes to us or her banker immediately and we figure it out. Speaking of that, explain that she should always call her bank herself, go to the website on her own instead of responding to links and calls that seem to be from the bank. Elderly people are sitting ducks for financial scams.

Last thing, but some communities have ride services for seniors and you might connect her to that, too. They’re absolutely used to seniors calling on the phone, but they do have calendars online to schedule trips to places like the library and even some social outings (at least in my area) for days they’ll take people to cool stuff like museums or local festivals."

NoStupidQuestions,Why is the age of puberty dropping so rapidly?,"> What leptin is there for essentially is to tell the brain whether you have enough energy reserves to undertake comparatively demanding challenges like getting pregnant or starting puberty. If your hormones think you are starving, those processes will not be allowed to begin. That’s why young people who are anorexic often have a very delayed start to puberty. “It’s also almost certainly why puberty starts years earlier now than it did in historic times,” says Wass. “In Henry VIII’s reign, puberty started at sixteen or seventeen. Now it is more commonly eleven. That’s almost certainly because of improved nutrition.”

NoStupidQuestions,Why are Americans so obsessed with perfect teeth?,"A vast, vast majority of the people in America who are getting teeth whitening are not getting their fillings redone when whitening teeth. It's a relatively cheap, cosmetic thing to do at a dentist here or at home with whitening strips/mouthwash.

Dentists here generally aren't going to recommend redoing a bunch of fillings. What they will say is ""Your fillings are going to be a different color because they won't be impacted by the whitening"". Or depending on where your fillings are ""hey just so you know this parts going to be noticeable."" 

Whitening services are also actively sold by many dentists. It's a way for them to increase revenue."

NoStupidQuestions,What’s the right move when the person in the plane seat next you is spilling into your seat?,"This just happened to me. Dude sitting aisle, me sitting window, passed out snoring super loud and kept falling over on my shoulder. He’d doze, lean over on me, wake up, right himself, and repeat. The couple across from us kept giving me OMG looks. In order to not make a scene, I waited for beverage service and had opened up a notes window on my phone and typed “please help? I don’t know the guy next to me and he keeps passing out on my shoulder”. When the FA came by I handed her my phone and she said, “oh, there’s an open seat back here by your friends if you’d like to move to be closer to them?” I was able to move, didn’t embarrass the poor sleepy guy, and was able to feel comfortable for the rest of the flight."
NoStupidQuestions,Are women actually oblivious to their guy friends wanting to sleep with them?,"It doesn't explain every women but my wife and a friend were oblivious to close friends wanting to date them because they treat everybody from their co-worker to Grandman with the same warmth and friendliness and  expect everybody to be like that.

As far as they knew their guy friend who wanted to only hang out with them, was very touchy-feely and the like just had that sort of personality. They needed somebody to point out the guy was only like that with them.

The fact that they had positive friendships with the opposite sex also make you keep your guard down."

NoStupidQuestions,How do really fat couples have sex.,"I worked a construction job with an older coworker (skinny guy) who was really into big girls, and generally shameless talking about his adventures. He was telling me about his recent tinder date, said she lied on her profile picture and was way more woman than he thought he could handle, but was able to use a broom handle to lift her stomach out of the way. He said this with a serious and straight face without a single discernible crack in expression. I believe him because it seemed like he was more proud of his ingenuity in the situation than getting laid. He was not an attractive dude and I can’t unsee the image my mind created from his story…"

NoStupidQuestions,"Serious question: for those of you who are happily married or happily dating, what's the main reason you don't cheat on your partner?","The desire to stay in my relationship is stronger than the desire for sex with someone ""different."" (The reason being that my wife satisfies all my needs, loves me, and tolerates me, and that's a rare find.)

That's excluding the fact that it's also a betrayal of trust that would eat at my conscience. It takes a special kind of selfish to betray someone's trust and feel no remorse."

NoStupidQuestions,Why don’t I hear Russians complaining about their dead/missing men. I did the math.,"Russian women have been complaining about their missing men for years. Not just in the Ukraine war, but in other conflicts, and also just deaths/disappearances during non-conflict military service/training."
NoStupidQuestions,Why are adults so hooked on alcohol?,"It took me until the age of 32 to understand. Both parents were alcoholics and addicts, my younger brother got hooked at 12 because my mom needed a drinking buddy once my dad died and I was a “brown noser” 

Every time I touched alcohol I felt nothing good. I’d get a headache, stomach ache, just wanted to lay down. Tried all different kinds even. Had zero interest in it and even ran a scratch kitchen in a bar for ten years and had no idea how people managed to like it. I figured I had some genetic problem that blocked my enjoyment and that was fine with me but I was frustrated because I didn’t get to understand.

At some point around 31-32 I went on a date with a full fledged alcoholic who pressured me into drinking with him. For the first time in my life I got drunk. Then I understood. Most of the day I was stressed, felt like an alien (autism and adhd) spent most of my time confused and masking…. Anxiety….

A few drinks and I felt normal and like I could connect to people. After a life time of bullying and not quite understanding others, it made me feel like it all clicked and I was one cool cat.

Problem is, it did not all click and I wasn’t any cooler. I just thought I was and my brain stopped running in circles because I was actively poisoning myself. 

I very quickly understood why my (autistic savant) father was so addicted to drinking that even at our deepest level of poverty when we couldn’t afford food they would scrape together change and ration out beers and liquor for him daily. He *needed* it to function in society, work as hard as he did, and get along with people at work (required at his job). I say *needed* because he certainly didn’t but the magic elixir that made his life easier? He wasn’t ever letting it go. 

I have a feeling it provides that kind of feeling for more people than just folks with mental health issues , or autism /adhd/etc. 

Frankly how absolutely normal I felt, scared the daylights out of me. I could see how addictive that feeling could get, even with the stomach ache head ache recovery from hangovers etc. 

Had I felt that much earlier in life before I could process it properly, I likely would have become an addict too.

There are plenty of days where I’m a bit cynical about it because although they were alcoholics, they functioned seemingly better than I did. I would beat myself up over not being able to relax or have a good time, not doing something that clearly would give me a break (words my mother would throw at me constantly). Then I realized it’s a facade, and although I struggle more in my day to day, I am not a completely miserable human being either.

NoStupidQuestions,"I’m a teenager today was my first day working in my life, does it get better?","It is unlikely you'll work the same job at the same place with the same people with the same lack of knowledge for the rest of your life.

The immediate frustrations, struggles, and general shitiness will fade.  It is largely due to being in an entirely new experience with new people and new stress and new responsibilities.  This will ease as you get familiar with everything.  It may still suck, but it'll be a familiar type of suck.

Use this as your fire to do well in school, the motivation to identify and pursue a career you do want.  There are many different kinds of jobs out there and they are wildly different in many ways.  There are corporate jobs, freelance jobs, office jobs, shop jobs, people jobs, outside jobs, and so much more.

Best advice I ever got was to find the job which has the stress you handle best.  All jobs will have times where they are stressful, but there are many kinds of stress and everyone handles it differently.  Stress isn't inherently bad - some people love the stress of tight deadlines, some people love the stress of broken things needing to be figured out and fixed, some people love the stress from needing to understand and help others handle their stress.

Right now you are just starting out and it is absolutely the deepest end of the cesspool.  If it was a good, fun, clean, relaxing job it wouldn't be staffed by teenagers.  But it is also a temporary thing.

I had a friend in college who started off as a partier, skipping classes and screwing around.  Failed enough classes that they kicked him out for a semester (academic probation).  He spent that semester and the summer working the only job he could find - commercial roofing.  Spreading tar on roofs in the middle of a Virginian summer.

He was a straight A student from the moment he came back.  Said it was the worst time of his entire life and he was never going to go back to that job.  He limited his parties to Friday nights, he attended his classes, pursued internships, and got a good job after graduating with honors.

It isn't always possible to take the traditional routes to success.  But no path involves accepting things as they are and becoming complacent.  Good luck, be realistic with your goals, don't let the current problems stop you from working on future solutions."

NoStupidQuestions,What's the difference between mansplaining and just a man explaining something to a woman?,"Explaining something she already knows but the man assumes she doesn't ONLY because she is a woman.

 Either it is common knowledge and the man is talking to her like an idiot who couldn't possibly know such an obvious thing. 

Or it is specialized knowledge and the man does not trust or value the womans expertise on the subject, even if she has extensive knowledge about it and he has little to none. So he insists on explaining something she is already knowledgeable about, as if she were a novice."
NoStupidQuestions,When did gender identity become popularized in the mainstream?,"I don't know if I missed it, but I still didn't see the answer he's looking for and I'm curious as well.

NoStupidQuestions,My neighbor is an 85yr old woman who lost her husband of 37yrs last month. She’s having a really hard time dealing with it. What can I do for her to help ease her pain?,"Aw this is nice of you.

She wants to stay busy, that's an excellent sign.

Some ideas -- depending on what she does/likes -- can you think of anything she could legitimately do for you? She's not a little kid, so don't make up busywork, but like, can she handle your dog ok? I mean is her mobility decent enough he's not a danger to knock her over?

Can you ask if she could basically doggy daycare him a few days a week so you can really concentrate on work?

Alternately -- does she like to cook? Can you say the meals she's been offloading reminded you how much you missed X and you wonder if, if you bought the ingredients, she'd make whatever for you once a week?

Did she have a job ? Can you ask her to do something in that realm? If she was a bookkeeper can she do something for you or someone you know, if she was a nurse, maybe you can lowkey check around for volunteer opportunities and then say hey you heard this place....

Does she have a hobby like knitting she might teach you? You can say you saw the British diver knitting and you've been curious about it ever since, can she teach you?

Also can she teach you some recipes you know she makes, baking or cooking -- if you can spend a couple hours on a weekend and let her show you how to bake her specialty.

Also, maybe bring up volunteering in general -- is there something you do or could that she could tag along and try?

My grandmother was bereft when my grandfather died after 60+ years of marriage. After a year we finally convinced her to try volunteering at the local hospital. She's been in the newspaper winning awards for the amount of volunteer hours. She floats around, walks files from place to place, answers phones, does basic paperwork.

She also loves when any of us drop by and just suggest we go get coffee and a pasty or lunch or ice cream someplace."

NoStupidQuestions,"As of about 15 minutes ago, I am now homeless. What’s the best course of action from here?","Be safe, contact friends and people you TRUST. Do not tell strangers or even loose-friends about your situation no matter how nice they seem. Find someplace safe you can park your car if you plan on living in it long term and try to stay around other people. An empty parking lot on the outside may seem like a good spot to not get caught for trespassing, but you're also a lot more vulnerable when no one is around.

edit: also one last thing, make sure you have a few people who always know where you are, and always keep your phone charged. You don't need a working carrier to dial 911, and there are plenty of VOIP SMS apps that allow you to text/call for free over the internet if you struggle to make a payment for your mobile phone plan, chances are you can find free wifi somewhere."

NoStupidQuestions,What’s the worst part of being a man?,"So many of these I'm empathetic towards. I'm a medically retired veteran with multiple deployments. I have several family members who also served though either didn't deploy at all or deployed to a non combat area. When they first found out I was trying to get help for PTSD the amount of times I heard ""Man Up"" or some similar thing it made me feel ashamed and slowed me down from getting the help I actually needed. I got out of the military in 2012 but didn't get the ""retired"" status until about 2018. They even coded my exit paperwork for severe PTSD but because I bought into the man up bs from my family I wasn't following up with the VA. I was sleeping maybe 3 hours a week, constantly waking up from night terrors, extremely paranoid about random people trying to kill me. I had been shot and blown up on my deployments multiple times. I was constantly reliving those experiences as I was trying to display to my ""friends"" how much of a ""badass"" I was to cover up how weak I really felt. 6 years I lived like that, with violent outbursts over seemingly nothing, lying to myself and those around to fit their definition of a ""man"". 6 fucking years I lost because ""getting help is a sign of weakness"" and ""suck it up ""buttercup"". Not one of these prior service family members had been to war, killed, had people attempt to kill them but their idea of a man was somehow superior to what I actually was. I was fortunate when I met my wife she knew how to make me feel ok getting help, ok having weaknesses, she helped me feel great about who I was and getting help. When her family found out I was getting disability and retirement they also tried to make me feel shitty or less of a person but she let me stand up for myself and a better definition of ""man"". I worry about those with similar experiences to my own that don't have that one person, friend, family, or whoever to tell them it's ok to get help. It's ok to be hurt. It's ok to talk about it."

NoStupidQuestions,"People who sleep with someone knowing that the other person is married, and it’s obviously not consensual to that marriage partner, why?","I did this when I was younger. I used to get off on the fantasy that I was so attractive and “special” that the dude was willing to cheat on his partner with me. Fuelled by a scarcity mindset and competition with other women, it made me feel like I was “winning” somehow. The taboo of it being off-limits also made it hotter. And then I could justify it with a “not my monkeys, not my circus” mindset, that I wasn’t the one making commitments to his gf/wife, and it was his problem.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do cities and places with higher education tend to be more liberal while more rural places tend to be conservative?,"I grew up conservative, in the middle of nowhere, then moved to the city in my later teen years. Ultimately changing my social and political views. I'll try to explain it as best I understand it. 

When I say middle of nowhere, I'm referring to an area with an average graduating class size of 8 people. Out there, it's mostly older families and older teachers. Everybody knows everybody. Growing up there, most of the families were already conservative. Likely because there's a lot more sense of 'I can handle myself and don't need the government'. Land is (relatively) cheap, most people are on their own well water/septic systems. Roads aren't paved. You never see police around. Many are relatively self sufficient. So when everyone you can see and know perceives there being little to no benefit from being taxed, they lean towards whatever side tells them taxes will be less. Not to mention hunting being extremely popular, so owning guns is absolutely a cultural thing. Not to mention, most shootings happen somewhere far away. It's this isolated experience that contributes the most. The idea that the 'problems' are far away and the 'liberal solutions' are only helping people that are far away too. When nobody you know is seeing the problems or the benefits, it becomes easy to believe it's not really a problem. 

This extends into the schooling too. I can't stress enough how poorly my school was managed. Teachers were regularly fired right before they had tenure to keep costs down. I knew a couple kids who graduated barely knowing how to read. Our textbooks were falling apart and were printed in the 70s or 80s (this was around 2010). Many teachers would show what they pleased in class and never get caught if they broke code. I remember being shown in 'history' a video about: 'The Muslims plan to take the western world by taking advantage of America's declining birthrate.' And how they would outnumber us if we let them. Sex ed was optional because parents complained about their children being 'exposed to it'. History class entirely skipped the Civil War, WWI and any conflict that America wasn't in. American history was just about the founding of the nation. And World History was just about  America's contribution in WWII. Kids only failed classes if they didn't show up. And teachers would openly try to guide you toward their political thinking. Some newer teachers would try to introduce more open ideas from time to time, but they'd be fired in less than a year due to parent complaints.

Moving to the city for my senior year was a culture shock. I found there was so much more going on. I no longer had to go by what I was told, and had to contend with people with different beliefs. For example, I was always told that LGBT folks were either just weirdos trying to ruin family values or attention seeking and jumping on a trend or in the worst cases, told that gay men would openly try to molest me. After actually meeting some, it was clear how bullshit that story was. These were just folks trying to be themselves, harming nobody and had to deal with a world telling them they couldn't be themselves. I'd list more,  but this has gone on long enough.

Point is, I can't stress enough how easy it is to believe what you're told growing up in a small community. When you never hear the other side of the argument from a person, or see who stands to benefit or suffer from decisions. Everybody you know tells you how the world is, and everything you see in your small view of the world reinforces it. And all you ever see of the other side of the argument is the straw men presented by people trying to prove them wrong."

NoStupidQuestions,Am I silly for only having used the official reddit app?,"Part of it is an age thing. Before 2016 there wasn't an official app, so if you wanted an app for Reddit then your only options were third party. Ever since the official app launched, it's always been behind those apps developmentally and so the vast majority of people who started with third party apps wouldn't have switched to the official one.

But since the official one launched, I'd imagine the majority of users just downloaded that and never thought to even look at the third party apps. If you're looking for a reddit app then you're just going to search ""reddit"" on the app store and pick the official one. If you don't know what you're missing out on then why would you even bother looking at third party?"
NoStupidQuestions,Does Trump have to register as a sex offender now?,"This trial was in civil court, not criminal court. He was not convicted of sex abuse in a criminal sense. The only penalty (I believe) is monetary. Punishments like jail time and the like don't apply.

&#x200B;

Edit: A couple people have asked why criminal and civil cases are separated even if they're about the same event:

He has been found civilly liable, not criminally guilty. Legally, those are different things arrived at through similar judicial processes but with some differences. (Edit: The statute of limitations for prosecuting Trump criminally for the events in question is long since expired. However, the NY state legislature recently pass a law allowing plaintiffs to bring civil cases even if the statute of limitations has expired.)

The first reason there are two different tracks is that it does not makes sense that someone in a contract dispute should be subjected to the same process as someone accused of murder. The nature of those violations are obviously very different, so civil court would be the place for something like that to go.

Now, there is obviously no contract dispute in the Carroll-Trump case, so that logic doesn't apply. The reason why criminal activity can be pursued in civil court in addition to criminal court is to allow victims (or victims' families) to recoup losses from the person accused of having wrong them. A criminal prosecution would put a person in jail, but that result would not compensate the victim or their family financially for the loss they incurred.

So why not simply do these at the same time? Why not criminally convict someone and award the aggrieved party financial compensation in a single process?

The reason is reflected in the burden of proof each judicial process requires. While a criminal defendant must be found guilty ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", a civil defendant must be found liable by a ""preponderance of the evidence"". In other words, a criminal trial jury must be 95% sure that the defendant is guilty, whereas a civil jury must be 51% sure that a defendant is liable.

The justification for this is that taking away someone's freedom is more serious than taking away their money or property. If we're going to take away someone's freedom, we need to be certain (in a legal sense) that this individual did what they are accused of.

This has allowed seemingly contradictory decisions between the two courts based on the same evidence. One of the most famous examples if of OJ Simpson being acquitted of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. According to the jury in the criminal trial, the prosecutors had failed to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that OJ Simpson committed the crime. However, he was found liable for the deaths by another jury in civil court, because the evidentiary threshold is much lower."

NoStupidQuestions,I am a guy who is only 5'5. Be honest:is 'haha look at the midget' your first thought when you see a guy my height?,"Some psychologists did a study where they put a big ugly scar on people's faces before having them interact with people in a variety of situations. The trick was that right before they started the interactions, the makeup artists removed the scar on the pretext of ""touching it up"". But the participants in the study reported people's strong negative reactions to the scar, and felt judged, discriminated against and as though people were disgusted by their appearance. There was no scar, but there were expectations of one. 

The point is, your expectations will in part shape people's attitudes towards you, and in a much bigger part, shape your perceptions of how people are reacting to you. If you go out convinced that people are ""laughing at the midget"", you'll  100% experience that. 

Just keep reminding yourself that for the majority people, you come across as the person **you** think you are. If you're the chill guy who likes to joke around, that's what people see. If you're the short guy with a complex about it, that's what people will see. Try to find a way to set your expectations in a positive frame."

NoStupidQuestions,In the US why do they keep voting on the same speaker of the house expecting different results?,"If you come from a country with a parliamentary system, this would be most similar to a situation where the party with the most seats doesn't have enough to form a government by itself and needs to form a coalition to select a PM, but struggles to form that coalition. It's messy and can take a while.

McCarthy is the preferred candidate for 90% of the Republican caucus, but there are a group of Republicans who find McCarthy to be unacceptable. Usually conflicts like this are resolved either by finding a consensus candidate or by pressuring/bullying reluctant caucus members to go along with the caucus majority, but 20 have stubbornly held their ground and refuse to vote for McCarthy.

The same thing nearly happened back in 2016, but that time McCarthy caved and stepped aside rather than see this happen. This time, he stupidly thought he could bully them to accept him even after pissing them off even more than they were 8 years ago, and with a much thinner margin. Only 5 have to hold their ground for the vote to fail, and it's now up to 21 not voting for him.

It will eventually resolve, but could take a while. McCarthy could once again accept that he doesn't have the votes and step aside. This is unlikely though as it would be political suicide after forcing this mess, and he has a lot of friends who don't want to see him humiliated. (it would also risk his strongest allies' positions in congress) Other options include caving to the demands of the 21 holdouts or trying to get some Democrats to support him. Either way he'd have to offer them something and it would take 15-16 minimum, assuming that whatever he offers doesn't lose him more GOP votes."
NoStupidQuestions,Why is “being woke” considered a bad thing?,"It depends. There's being more considerate; realizing some behaviors are inherently racist, ableist, homophobic, etc. and trying to do better and be kinder. But there's some people who take it so far that nobody could ever please them and it comes off more like they're virtue signaling than actually being genuine in their consideration of other people's feelings. Oftentimes, this you can see when someone not of a marginalized group speaks for that group.

For example, we were often taught in school that ""African American"" was the polite term and if you used anything else it was racist. However, actual black people will tell you they prefer the term ""Black"" and it's more about how you use the word. Or when we are told to say ""special needs"" when it's preferred to say disabled by actual disabled people. Being ""woke"" or considerate is not inherently bad, but there is a line between being kind and essentially mocking marginalized people by virtue signaling and not being genuine."

NoStupidQuestions,Is it weird to give my coworker over $1400 for a Gift?,"It's a little weird but your explanation makes it understandable. Get him a card and write out a short note explaining that he was a great coworker, he inspired you and motivated you, and you wanted to repay his kindness. Give him cash, not a check because he won't cash it and not a prepaid credit card because those are weird. Put the cash inside a little envelope inside the card (like a bank sleeve or a cash gift sleeve) so that he reads the note before he sees how much cash is there  Make sure you seal the big envelope really well, maybe even tape it, and write his first and last name on it in case he drops it or something. If you can, hand it to him personally before you leave, and just say something nice and tell him ""I really wanted to give you this"" so he knows it was intentional. If he starts to open it in front of you, ask him to open it at home because you'll be embarrassed. If he opens it in front of you, he will very likely try to refuse your generosity. If he opens it in front of you or other coworkers, he will likely be embarrassed. 

But know this - that kind of money will change his life, or the life of someone he loves, for the better and that sounds like the kind of blessing you want to share with him. Go for it!"

NoStupidQuestions,Is choosing to not initiate every time as a guy a dating death sentence?,"The majority of women still see it as the man's responsibility to initiate.

Some will make the first move as you have experienced but it's a drop in the bucket. So short answer to your question is unfortunately, yes."

NoStupidQuestions,What happens if you dont rake leaves from yard?,"I used to work for a city that would come by and vacuum your leaves up for you if you raked them to the curb. People would b**** at me relentlessly (I was the communications office) if we were “late” getting to their property. (You cannot vacuum leaves when it’s raining or snowing, so bad weather would throw off our schedule.) They were pissed because they thought a pile of leaves sitting on the parkway a week would kill their grass. 

It does not.

Our public works director despised the fact that we offered this service at all because by far the best thing you can do, both for your lawn and the environment as a whole, is to mow over your leaves and leave them to decompose over the winter. It adds nitrogen back into your lawn and eliminates the need for fertilizer in the spring. If your leaves are VERY thick, you might consider raking up some of them to pack around your delicate, cold-sensitive plants for insulation. Pull ‘em back in the spring, top with wood chips (free from our municipal pile), and voila, natural, hyper-local lawn care, no Scott’s Toxic Petroleum-based Turf Builder or trips to Home Depot required.

Or, FFS, just give up on lawn maintenance and let it go back to nature. More biodiverse and healthy for everyone if we all stop keeping up with the Joneses. The Joneses, turns out, are ecological nightmares.

EDIT: Thank you all for the awards and upvotes! (My first gold!) Just wanted to add that, for those who say their leaves are killing their grass, there are a few likely considerations. (1) Your leaves are very thick. If you have a ton, they will mat and smother. Rake them into the garden or a compost heap for winter. (2) You may have a species of tree that has leaves that purposefully kill grass, for example, magnolias. This is nature's way of eliminating competition for soil nutrients at the tree's base. (3) Your grass may not be the best breed of grass for your location. If it seems exceptionally fragile (thins easily, requires lots of weed killer and fertilizer) it may be that your kind of grass was not meant to grow in that spot due to soil conditions, sun, and the myriad other things that affect plant growth. 

Of course, most turf-like grasses are not native and are not meant to grow in North America. To go as maintenance free as possible, ironically, you want to plant more/other stuff. If I've piqued your interest at all on the possibilities that may exist beyond your labor intensive, classist, ecologically awful lawn, I highly recommend the book ""Food Not Lawns"" by H.C. Flores as a place to start. It's available for free online and can be found via a simple Google search.

I've been slowly ripping out lawn and putting in natives, trees/shrubs and edibles for about a decade now on my small-urban/kinda suburban property, and while there's some upfront work, the maintenance is  relatively low (especially as I figure out what works where and which plants are not worth it). Plus, neighborhood kids sit in my front garden and eat strawberries like I'm some non-evil gingerbread house witch."

NoStupidQuestions,I just watched someone pass away after a car accident. So do I talk to the family? What do I do?,"I would just tell them you did not leave the person alone until help arrived, that you stayed and prayed, and they were not alone.

NoStupidQuestions,Is it childish that I as an adult(24~25m) enjoy playing kid's games and buying legos because I didn't have any happy moments in my childhood?,"Playing is human, and not specific to children. If you want to play, play! Studies have shown many adults don't play enough. But also: don't worry about something being childish. You can be as ""childish"" as you want as long as you're not hurting anyone else. (For example, it's not appropriate to yeet your dinner plate across the room then lay down and throw a tantrum, but if you want to play on an empty jungle gym or do a coloring book, knock yourself out.)"
NoStupidQuestions,Do you find it emotionally immature when a man gets disgusted when his daughters has their periods?,"Yes.  My dad is 85.  40 years ago when I was a teen..... my dad would inform my sister and I that he was on his way to the drug store.  Then he'd ask if we needed anything   if we said yes, he'd ask what colour box we needed.  THAT is maturity, in a time when periods weren't talked about my dad recognized it's just part of life and adapted."
NoStupidQuestions,Why did my cousin tell me to go to the gym after getting rejected by a girl?,"It's because it's the most well known ways of working on and focusin on yourself. He's saying forget about the girl, continue to improve yourself, then go for the next one. There's also a meme where when you're rejected you have to hit the gym hard for whatever reason. Like a bounce back type of thing. 

You could apply this advice to anything you're working on really, hell could even get a new hobby."

But my credit card company caught it immediately and cancelled the transaction, the card, and started an investigation.  The girl was fired and the bank pressed charges.  Idk what happened after that.  She ordered lingerie and some cigars for some reason.  The thing that was so dumb was she ordered it to her house which is how they found her identity."
NoStupidQuestions,"The love of my life now doesn't want kids, what do I do?","I've heard it said that having kids is one of the few relationship disagreements that it's not possible to compromise on.

NoStupidQuestions,"Why is it that in some jurisdictions a drunk person can’t consent to sex, but they can consent to waive their miranda rights and be interviewed by police officers?","People like to make crap like this up.  

Someone who is too drunk to consent to sex is too drunk to do a lot of stuff.  Any first year law student will show the video of the drunk being interrogated and get the Miranda waiver thrown out.  

You don't get ""too drunk to consent"" after 2 martinis.  It is seriously drunk and impaired.   

Every case is different, but the general idea is that consent can be revoked at any second.   If the person is willing to engage in sex now, but in 15 minutes might be puking so hard that they can't say ""stop"" or remember their ""safe word"", or that they might decide just to go to sleep during sex - that means that they can't withdraw consent.    The inability to withdraw consent is important, too. 

Or, like I said - every case is different.  
Do you have anyone who was unable to consent to sex but was questioned by police an hour or two later to illustrate this point?"
NoStupidQuestions,Why are there so many “ladyboys” in Thailand?,"A Thai person once told me, in the Thai culture, they have 6 genders: straight male, gay male, trans men, straight women, gay women, trans women.

So 'ladyboys' are seen as their own thing there. It's weirdly backwards. They're accepting of lgbt things, but in their own way.

An example he gave: in lesbian relationships, one has to be butch and one has to be fem, otherwise it's seen as really weird. So they accept lesbians, but only if they present themselves in a specific way. Same with ladyboys, I assume.

I actually worked with a ladyboy for a while, Dream was her name. Really nice lady, really terrible at her job unfortunately..."

NoStupidQuestions,"Why are artists such as painters, authors, actors and directors often liberal or left leaning ?","Artists are often creatives types who are aiming to break the mold and see life through unique perspectives in order to further their art. They literally want to see the world in new, avant-garde ways. 

This is basically a form of progresivism, which also seeks out new ideas and lends itself to liberal, left-leaning outlooks that prefer to disrupt the existing orders to form new and (hopefully) improved ones. 

Conservatism, by contrast, aims to preserve the older ideologies. Eschewing new, unknown, and perceivably dangerous ideas for those that are established, proven, safe, and familiar."

NoStupidQuestions,Why don't Western democracies elect men with beards?,"It’s weird how the length of facial hair and head hair has meant different things throughout history. In the 1800s having a big beard made you look sophisticated and wise. In the 1700s, having long hair in America meant you weren’t infected with syphilus so you were probably an upstanding man who didn’t sleep around (hence all the powdered wigs for the men who lost their hair to the disease)

In the 1960s long hair and beards were coopted by the anti-war left. While in the 50s the ideal professional look was clean shaven and short hair, probably because so many men returned home from WWII with that look."

That way it won’t have to go through probate, and I think the only tax bill would come if they sold the house.  If they will live in it, no tax bill except property taxes.  At least in my state.  YMMV.  Setting up a Living Trust costs a few bucks more than just a straight will, but it’s a lot easier on the person inheriting."
NoStupidQuestions,How do I tell my wife that her being on top of me during sex is literally stopping me from breathing without making her feel bad about her weight?,Suggest different positions maybe? and see if that works. but eventually you may just have to be straight up with her.

NoStupidQuestions,How long does it take to overcome homophobic feelings? I want them to stop. TL;DR at the end.,"There’s a quote that goes something like “You aren’t responsible for your first though. You are, however, responsible for your second thought and your first action.”  

You can’t control what thoughts pop into your mind. Some of these have been deeply engrained into you, as you’ve heard them over and over again your whole life, and will take some time to replace. You CAN control the second though. You can recognize that the first thought was wrong and correct it. Do this enough times, and you’ll start thinking that second thought first.  

I’ve been where you are, and it does take time, but you’ll get there. You’re basically reprogramming your own brain, so it’s hard, but for the better. It’s much more rewarding to live a life of love rather than hate. Which is ironic, considering the people that taught us this were “selfless Christian full of love”."

NoStupidQuestions,Why has Big Tobacco not gone hard on cannabis and pushed through legalization? You would think we could buy Marlboro Ultra Highs in the purple tie dye pack by now.,"Part of it is that cannabis and hemp are really easy to grow compared to tobacco. Big Tobacco does not want to have to compete with the proliferation of small growers and boutique brands. The answer is money, always money.

They probably will get into the game once it is legal and regulated at the federal level.

Edit: Oops, I was vague. I'm talking less about the physical act of growing plants and more about all the regulations and restrictions on growers who want to sell their product commercially. Big Tobacco has had a long time to create a favorable regulatory environment for themselves that has made it difficult for small growers and manufacturers to compete. Because cannabis is not legal at the federal level, there is no way to use the same tactics against small growers. This may change after it becomes legal.

Edit #2: Big Tobacco has been studying cannabis since the 70's, and has more recently (last 5-10 years) invested heavily in research of various cannabis products. Internal documents from several of the major players have outright stated that a pivot to cannabis products is key to their long term business strategy. They have done all this while publicly stating that they have no intention of getting into the pot market, and actively lobbying against legalization. This isn't because they don't want to make loads of money off of cannabis eventually, they just want to make sure they are the ones in control of when and how legal pot hits the mainstream market.

What Big Tobacco is currently doing (among other things), is lobbying to loosen the restrictions on vaping products and ensure that these devices aren't automatically covered by FDA regulations on tobacco products. So, they are doing A LOT of behind the scenes work to make sure they are in a strong position when legalization happens. But time is on their side, and the longer they have to set the stage for their own products to sweep the market, the more they stand to profit in the long run. It's not that they couldn't bring products to market now, it's that the money required to do so is currently better spent elsewhere. Hence the initial statement about not wanting to compete with a bunch of small growers and brands in the current market.

Final Edit (I swear): My personal guess on how it will go down after legalization is that there will be an initial surge of relatively cheap cannabis products, with a lot of variety. Within a few years, there will be an outcry from some astroturf movement about how kids are getting hold of products that are too strong and overdosing, or some similar B.S. Big Tobacco will take this as an opportunity to lobby for the ban of all extracts, resins, and oils that can be used for homebrew vaping or making edibles, all in the name of ""safety"". The only option will be to buy single use cannabis vaping cartridges that cannot be refilled, and only work with a specific device. No other companies will be allowed to sell cartridges for Big Tobacco vapes (cause safety, remember?) and they are currently crafting the legislation that will make it very hard for small companies to bring their own devices to market.

You'll probably still be able to get actual buds from boutiques, and even resins/oils at a dispensary with a medical card, but the only thing you'll find at the corner store is overpriced crappy Big Tobacco vape products."
NoStupidQuestions,Has Anyone Successfully Reduced Consumption of Alcohol without Quitting?,I personally think there’s a difference between wanting a drink and needing a drink.

Negro, while not as offensive as the N-Word, was still used as a term to refer to black people in America during slavery, and is generally still regarded as an impolite term."
NoStupidQuestions,Why are russian billionaires called ”oligarchs” and western ones just ”billionaires”?

NoStupidQuestions,Why is cocaine being laced with fentanyl?,"Coming here with first hand knowledge. Cocaine dealers would not add fentanyl as a cutting agent unless they are crazy. 

It is cross-contamination the vast majority of times. One has to understand that drug dealers are not keeping their different drug stashes safe from one another. One custy comes in for fent then the next for cocaine. Same table, scale, scooper, etc. Plus most drug dealers are also high and absolute wrecks.

Shit, sometimes the fent is white powder so it could easily be given to someone by accident. 

Luckily, when I was dealing, fent didn't exist. Although I did give people ketamine instead of coke a few times. I also did that to myself. Which is somewhat hilarious as the first pooter is a doosy."

NoStupidQuestions,Miss prison? Am I a freak?,"This totally makes sense. 

The rules were clear. The requirements were simple. Life was a straight, narrow and predictable path forward.

I would imagine you were not judged for what you’d done or what you were dealing with either. 

You had a community, even if it was on the inside. Communities don’t have to be somewhere specific to count (eg outside of prison) and your common bond doesn’t have to be something positive (attending an Ivy League). It can be as simple as it was.

NoStupidQuestions,Why is there a pregnant dad emoji? (IOS🫃),"People are trying to have a little culture wars battle in these comments, but the reason is mostly technical.

A few years ago, there was only one emoji for most of the ones depicting people. Which meant that they had to pick a gender for each role, like dancer, police officer, doctor, etc.

So the fix they came up with was to use the existing [""zero-width joiner character,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner) which is already used in some languages for tying different glyphs together. For some, they join the man or woman emoji to the target emoji. For others, they join the target emoji to the male or female symbol emoji.

Examples:

* 👩 + (zero width joiner) + ⚕️ = 👩‍⚕️
* 👯 + (zero width joiner) + ♂️ = 👯‍♂️

As an aside, it works the same way for the skin color emojis.

👍 + (zero width joiner) + 🏻 = 👍🏻

As far as I know, this was done for all the people emojis. This led to some cases where you get things like pregnant dad. The point is to take advantage of the flexibility of the system to _let people express what they want_. 

[Paper describing how it works](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16181-gender-zwj-sequences.pdf)

Edit: also, since this is more complicated, some systems don't support it. Some older systems might not support it either. That's why you sometimes do see things like 👍 🏻 - the joiner is ignored, and both characters are printed sequentially."

NoStupidQuestions,Why is r/politics fully left wing?,"The subreddit invites those with strong political views to participate. 

Now reddit in general leans left and the way reddit works with upvotes/downvotes pushes out divergent views. 

Like lets say that at a point there are 60 left and 40 right people voting, the pro-left post ends up at +20 votes and the pro-right post ends up at -20 votes.  

Now this happens for a while and the right-leaning people get frustrated with the downvotes and migrate elsewhere.  

So right now its more like 90 left/10 right, so anything right wing is buried quickly. 

(yes its much more complex than this but just simplifying)."
NoStupidQuestions,Why is communism treated as such a hush hush topic?,"Don't know where you live, but here where I live (in former USSR country) it's completly normal to talk about communism because it was a big part of lives of past generations.

NoStupidQuestions,Are Jehovah's Witnesses a cult?,"Former JW here, born and raised.

They use a technicality to claim they aren’t a cult. Basically they think they aren’t a cult because they don’t have a human leader.

But, they are 10000% a cult. I was disfellowshipped (shunned) when I was 15 years old because I had a boyfriend at school. I had to go through a series of meetings with the “elders” (group of 3 50+ year old men) to determine if I should be shunned or not. In these meetings, I was asked about EVERY. SINGLE. DETAIL. About my sexual history. I lied and said I’d only made out and touched over the clothes. I got asked how many times I did it, for how long, how long were we touching (20 seconds? 1 minute?), did we kiss while we touched or not, did either of us climax, etc etc etc… I was 15 years old.

I’m 29 and still have very limited contact with my family. As in, I get told when a family member is in the hospital or died. I wasn’t allowed to come to my brothers wedding and I’ve never met his wife to give you a small example.

Im just scratching the surface of culty-ness. Look up the 2 witness rule and let me know what you think."
NoStupidQuestions,Do Americans have a habit to name their kids immediately after they are born?,"Yes, most parents in the US pick a name before the baby is born (or two names if they decide not to learn the sex before the birth). We usually sign the birth certificate and make the name legal within the first 72 hours.

With my first daughter, we learned her sex soon as we could. We started using her name immediately and openly. With our second daughter, we chose not to learn the sex, but we had both a boy's name and a girl's name picked out, and we immediately started using it."
NoStupidQuestions,Does a sexy woman flirting with a man make him more attractive to other women?,"You should check out Mythbusters, there is science behind it, but the basic principle is that if a man is deemed worthy of being a potential partner to one woman, other women will start to see him as such.

NoStupidQuestions,Why are rural areas more conservative?,"The real answer to this question is much more nuanced than most of the answers you're getting. 

The first thing to realize is that everyone has problems and those problems are different based on your circumstances. 

If you live in the city high gas prices are less likely to impact you in a huge way. If you live in an area where the closest grocery store is 20+ miles away and work is an 80 mile round trip every day, gas prices are much more likely to impact your ability to do things like pay your bills. 

Conversely if you live in the city gun crime is a serious concern. If you life in a rural area guns are tools that are used for feeding your family and defending yourself because the police are no less than an hour away (at best). 

In both instances it's hard to empathize with someone whose problems seem less serious than yours- and this goes both ways. 

I've had this conversation with people before. I've had folks from the city tell me that people should move to more populated areas so they don't have to travel as far so they don't have to spend as much driving around. I've had this conversation with people from rural areas and they tell me that people who are worried about gun crime should move to a place with less gun crime. 

PROBLEMS SOLVED!

Except it's not. Both groups have real issues that impact their lives in very real, very different ways. 

People are often blinded by their own problems and we are prone to believing people with a different worldview believe what they believe because they are stupid or evil or uneducated or brainwashed or because they believe *insert your cable news station of choice talking point here* 

The simple fact is that everyone has problems that are real, understanding viewpoints different from your own is hard to do, especially when you don't want to and you're insulated in a community of people who believe the same things you believe. People in urban areas are more likely to take on a more socialistic set of beliefs, which isn't surprising given that people in cities rely on other people so many more aspects of their day to day lives. People in rural areas are more likely to take on a conservative set of beliefs, which isn't surprising because they rely on so many fewer people in their day to day lives. And both sets of people, unsurprisingly, dismiss the other group of people because the issues that ""those people"" face are so foreign they're hard to even conceive of. 

It's a complex issue and no one seems to want to have a conversation with any sense of nuance. Everyone wants to boil the ""other"" side down to a couple of talking points so that they're easy to dismiss. And frankly that's the dumbest thing we could do, yet I see it every day. 

source: grew up in a conservative rural area, moved to a medium sized city. Beliefs have changed in major ways due to my experiences in both urban and rural settings. Neither side is ""wrong"". Neither side has it worse. 99% of us share a common enemy but we're busy fighting with each other."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why is ""men and women can't be friends"" such a common opinion?","I think part of it is that we tend to assume that the things we see written online are by people who are close to our own age.  As someone in his 40s, I’ll read something and think “what grown adult actually thinks this?” And then realize it’s someone in high school and I’m like “oh”.  So many of these immature sentiments are being put out there by actual kids.  So many racist little Eric Cartman’s and precious little theater kids are projecting their very childish ideals with no filter or context, and it echos into this giant monolith that everyone looks at as “I guess this is what everyone believes now” when in reality most of the world doesn’t see things that way."
NoStupidQuestions,Why do pregnancy test adverts never show a relieved young woman with an Not-Pregnant result?,"They do.

NoStupidQuestions,Why do most young people skew left politically?,"Tldr: The young tend to want change. The old tend to want stability or comfort.

Most people aren't aiming for change at the age of 55. They're aiming to settle down and to not have to worry about instability ruining what they have. 

On the other hand, the young tend to be much more accepting of change because they're the ones driving most of it; It's their world. 

Society is ever changing, so it's inevitable that newer generations are moving away from what the previous ones were aiming for."

NoStupidQuestions,why do planes have a hundred switches that need to be flipped instead of just a single one that just turns it all on?,"I'm an airline pilot who flies the CRJ 900. 

I'm glad you asked this question, because I remember asking this very same question in this very same sub before I became a pilot many years ago on a different account. 

Most of the switches you see in the cockpit are never touched, only in case of an emergency. Starting the engine is a matter of pressing 2 buttons. Other than that and the flight controls (yoke, spoilers, flaps, gear, etc) you don't really touch much except for the FCP (flight control panel, to manipulate the flight director), FMS (flight management system, to load in departures, Arrivals, approaches, etc), and RTU (radio tuning unit, communications with atc) 

An aircraft is a sophisticated machine, with pressurization, electrical, pneumatics, fuel, hydraulics, fire detection and extinguishing, communications, bleeds and anti ice, oxygen, air conditioning, apu, power plant etc. There needs to be buttons to manipulate these many complex systems.

Example of emergency situations that need button manipulating: 

Engine failure, you have a button to transfer the hot bleed air from the working engine to the opposite (failed engine) wing to provide wing anti ice.

There's been an over current on your electrical bus, you have a button to isolate that bus from the system

One of the hydraulic pumps that provides your landing gear failed, there's a button to active the standby hydraulic pump

Your automated cabin pressure controller failed, you have buttons to manually control cabin pressurization in flight. 

You've completly lost AC power, there is a button to deploy the RAT/ADG to provide backup electrics


Etc.

Usually if something irregular happens in flight, a red master caution or yellow caution light on the glareshield appears. The first pilot noticing the problem says something along the line of ""identity the problem"". They read the message that appears. They then pull out the QRH (quick reference handbook) and follow the steps, which usually tells them to do the above, leading them to touch the many buttons you see in the cockpit."

NoStupidQuestions,"If there’s so much positive proof that 4 day school weeks for kids and 4 day work weeks for adults are extremely beneficial, why can’t it be implemented and why so much push back?","4 day school week is hard to implement until 4 day week is implemented at work. If you do the former before the latter it really screws over working parents because suddenly they need an extra day of childcare.

4 day week is slow to be implemented at work because work culture is generally very slow to change in such major ways (outside of being forced to by external events, e.g. Covid and home working). Companies and governments will need *a lot* of convincing that it won't negatively impact productivity and the economy, and won't have any other negative impacts, before they adopt it en masse."

NoStupidQuestions,12 year old daughter came out as bi. wants to keep having sleepovers with long time best friend.,"If your daughter had an ulterior motive and wanted to have those types of sleepovers with her friend without you suspecting anything, it would've been easier for her not to come out. So on that note, she's at least trusted you enough so she can't perfectly get away with that.

You could monitor them more, or cut their sleepover shorter, or have one sleep over in a sleeping bag and one sleep in a bed.   

Also its best to figure out if your daughter has any interest in her friend. I was in a similar situation to your girl and but I didn't view my gay bsf that way so nothing came of our sleepovers."
NoStupidQuestions,"Christians say that God sacrificed his only son to atone for our sins. But who was Jesus a sacrifice to? It has to be to the same God, the father, right? So if God wanted us forgiven couldn't he just have taken a deep breath and done it? Why would he need to sacrifice his son to himself as well?","What I'm about to say is a huge oversimplification.

There is an idea in **some branches** of Christianity that God's mercy has to be tempered by God's justice (and vice versa). Under God's justice, each of us would have to take the consequences of our sin. So, in God's mercy, God steps in and takes those consequences for us. Something like that is usually what modern Christians mean when they say that Jesus is an atoning sacrifice: it isn't the same logic as the sacrifice that is made **to** God; it is a sacrifice that is made **by** God to satisfy God's justice.

That said, there have been other theories of atonement throughout church history, and different Christians believe different things about it today."
NoStupidQuestions,"Since polygamy is illegal in the US, how is the cast of the television show ""Sister Wives"" not all in jail?","Polygamy being illegal only means that the government only recognizes one couple as married, the rest of the marriages are purely social/religious, which is totally legal."

NoStupidQuestions,"Could I pull a George Santos and lie that I’m republican but when I get in office, actually be a democrat?","You theoretically and legally could.

Pragmatically and realistically, though, winning elections and actually having an appointed position is a challenge. One that requires a lot of dough, and a lot of professional connections from people who endorse you (and are willing to give you money). Getting those sorts of connections requires establishing your loyalty with supporters. What history do you have that shows they can trust you? Because of this, it's going to be hard for you to instantly flip a switch and go ""Yo I'm totally a Republican"" if there's little reasons for Republican voters, political donors, or VIP's to back you up.

Now hypothetically, let's say you do a whole bunch of things that make Republicans happy, get a bunch of money, votes, and support, and win your election, only to publicly and unashamedly switch sides.

Well, unless you were appointed to some fascist head of state that has all the power, you can't really pull all the strings and levers by yourself. Your position is one of several other people. The Republicans among them are absolutely pissed at you and will do everything they can to avoid helping you, and the Democrats among them are probably going to be hesitant to take you for your word, given your whole history.

So your strategy's a good way to make it into office by sacrificing your morals for however long it takes you to get elected, then be completely ineffective at doing whatever it is you wanted to do.

Edit: I’ll clarify that this is my answer to the general question of “Can a person campaign for office as a member of one party and then switch when they’re in office?”. I haven’t been following Santos-related news very closely."

I think its something about country folk tend to think of their place as their castle and big city folks see that if you dont try to get along with the crowd around them then stuff dont work out too well.

If he starts talking about stereotypes or dynamics or something else like that - that's fetish territory. That's a red flag.

(edit for clarification: *fetishes in general aren't red flags unless they're being skeevy about engaging with them.

NoStupidQuestions,my partner wants to get an escort in vegas. should I be ok with this?,"It is by no means something most couples do in Vegas. However, there are couples who will go to Vegas explicitly for a threesome with a sex worker. You don't have to be okay with it, though. If you're not turned on by the idea of sharing a bedroom with someone else, you're allowed to say no. If you set that boundary, and your partner insists on violating it, I would think carefully about what's going on in his head."
NoStupidQuestions,NSFW: Is it ok to cum inside a girl while wearing a condom?,The condom is made to hold semen. It is perfectly normal to finish in the condom while still inside her. But make sure to pull out immediately afterwards and dispose of the condom.

NoStupidQuestions,Is Russia really this weak?,It's more like all the money they spent on military buildup went to all the oligarchs and they turned out inferior product.
NoStupidQuestions,why are men so eager on having anal sex?,"It's like a vacation to Canada.  It's a very close neighbor with understandable skepticism as to why you want to come in. You gotta go slow through the border. Can't go apeshit the second you get through, or you get kicked out.  But when you get in, it's similar and different in various aspects.  Hopefully, you visited a cleaner place, but you knew the risks going in if it was an impromptu trip. The locals might like foreigners, they might not.  Sometimes, it can take some convincing to get in.  If you're polite and don't make a mess or cause a ruckus, the locals might invite you back.  You can take pictures, but it's likely not too different from where you normally live.

Edit:  btw I don't think Canadians are assholes or that it's a shithole country. It was lovely when I went. You can *insert* any similar, neighboring country to yours for the **anal**ogy....   slowly"
NoStupidQuestions,Do you wash your hands immediately when you come home or am I the only weirdo?,"I never did until the pandemic. Now it's a habit that seems totally normal and I don't know why I didn't before. Like you said, outside is dirty. Same reason I take my shoes off when I come inside."
NoStupidQuestions,DeSantis said he would do away with the IRS among other departments and have a flat tax. What would doing away with the IRS really do for Americans?,"As a retired tax professional, the idea that a flat tax would make things fairer and simpler couldn’t be further from the truth.  The rate at which you are taxed is the absolute least complicated part of the tax code.  The complicated issue is how to define what income is subject to tax.  You can’t have two people that both bring in $100,000 per year taxed the same.  What if one of those people is a consultant with no expenses needed to bring in that income, and the other person is a caterer with food and other supply expenses.  The same applies to corporate taxes, there can be vast differences in the amount it costs to produce revenue in one industry v another.  What makes the tax code complicated is defining WHAT is income, WHEN (what year) it is income and all the tax breaks that have been introduced over the years.  The only thing a flat tax would do is make taxes less fair."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why are so many people pro-marijuana, and so many people anti-tobacco? They're both plants that are smoked which contain a drug. What's the difference?","When you say ""anti-tobacco"" and ""pro-marijuana"", it's also that we are speaking about two very different things.

People are ""anti-tobacco"" in so far as it's very addictive, very bad for one's health and it should really not be consumed. But nobody serious is talking about making it illegal or anything, just discouraging its use.

People are ""pro-marijuana"" not in the sense that they would want everyone to be a user, but more in the sense that it currently is illegal. Smoking marijuana should not be a felony and lend you in jail anymore than smoking tobacco. But it's still not very good for your health (although arguably not as bad a tobacco, considering all factors) so you're still probably better off not smoking it."
NoStupidQuestions,Why do fathers tend to be more overprotective of daughters than with their sons?,"I suspect they remember how **they** saw/treated girls when they were young and dumb…and don’t want their daughters to experience it from the boys who are young and dumb now.

NoStupidQuestions,"why do I hear often on Reddit, some people saying that left-winged people have a better education than center or right-winged people? is that true?","In general, people with college educations are more likely to have left leaning political views. This may be more that very right wing people aren't as likely to go to university in the first place, tending to go directly into trades. It may also be that going to a university exposes you to a wider diversity of people, which tends to make people more left leaning.

It's not necessarily ""smarter people are more liberal."""
NoStupidQuestions,Am I a racist because I dread having to call customer service because I know I’m going to get a foreign representative that I can barely understand.,"I've worked in the customer service industry since 2011. Everytime I get a compliment saying ""I'm so glad to finally talk to an American who can explain this to me and resolve my issues"", I feel a little bit hurt because I'm south east asian and English is my second language, it's an indictment of how companies that outsource hire in mass without proper assesment of someone's language and vocabulary abilities.

The training we go through isn't great either. We only go through a week understanding American slang, popular holidays, sports enthusiasm etc... There are no lessons to help us understand SVA, prepositions, pronunciations and grammar. It's just - ""Americans are solution driven, also they love football and thanksgiving. See you on the production floor 👍🏻""

I learned English from watching shows/movies and song lyrics. I've loved learning it from a young age, so I developed a way to ""fake"" my accent and manage to pull it off. If only companies paid attention to these trainings, it would've made a huge difference. The goal isn't even to sound American, but just to be comprehensive enough to help out. It's sad."

NoStupidQuestions,Is there an explanation as to why Gen Z seems to have a predisposition for mental conditions and neurodivergency?,"It's probably mostly reporting bias. A lot of this stuff wasn't noticed in previous generations.

For example - I'm an elder millennial, I have adhd. I didn't find that out till 2019, because when I was a kid, adhd was noisy little boys, not distracted girls. No one realising I had it doesn't mean I didn't have it all along. If people like me had been noticed back then, it probably wouldn't look like there was such an increase in gen Z."

NoStupidQuestions,"There’s a kid that keeps stealing food from my store, what would the right thing to do be?","You're awesome for wanting to help.

Talk to the kid.

Next time he walks in, greet him with a simple friendly greeting and try not to set off any alarm bells, because if he knows he's been caught he'll probably just leave.

A good tactic is to mention something he's wearing, like if he's wearing a cap from a sports team or something, make some small talk about that. Then once you  have his attention, tell him ""hey, lunch is on me today. What do you want?""  You can tailor it to the kind of stuff he's been taking. If he takes like a sandwich he's probably just feeding himself, but if he's stealing a whole gallon of milk or something you can put some stuff aside for him and when he comes in tell him ""I have something for you"" and give him some groceries to take home.

That's what I would try.

You could go as far as to ask him about his situation and stuff, but I think it's better to just try to do the good thing. If he decides to tell you about what's been going on, that's up to him.

I mean this may be a bad kid who likes to steal, but the fact that he's stealing food makes it look like yeah, he's probably just hungry. And even if he was just a bad kid, maybe having someone help him out without asking any questions will help him turn things around.

Really though most people who steal do it to survive, and it's very cool of you to give him the benefit of the doubt.

NoStupidQuestions,"Why are so many pro-social legal advancements being rolled back in the US? (LGBT rights, affirmative action, etc.)","To try and give a serious answer here that isn't just ""conservatives bad"" and also saying this as a non-American. 

It seems to me that a lot of these ""laws/rights"" were never explicitly either a law or a right but rather born out of interpretation of the constitution - a 250 year old document.

So taking abortion as an example here, the Roe vs Wade verdict was made out of an interpretation of the constitution. Now because it's interpreted rather than explicit, of course that means someone else's interpretation might not agree with that and hence it gets overturned. And shy of a new law coming in, a change in the SCOTUS could mean that the interpretation gets reinstated. A further change of SCOTUS revokes it again. 

It baffles me how many things seem to be set on precedent and interpretation rather than actual law. Why did nobody ever write in a federal law that guarantees abortion for example?

There are people out there who say the second amendment was written for a different time so to use it as the basis to not change gun laws today is stupid. So to me, it seems stupid when those same people use an interpretation of things written at the same time to try and justify today's world. 

Having a fight over whether or not a new law is constitutional is not the same as having a fight over if something is already protected by the constitution. 

Feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken here, but the overturning of Roe Vs Wade didn't say that abortion was unconstitutional but rather the right to it wasn't protected in the constitution. So to me, it seems like if you passed a federal bill allowing abortion, then it would stand and not be considered unconstitutional."
NoStupidQuestions,Why are there people worried about low birth rates and population collapse? Isn’t the earth over populated and less people would be better for the environment?,"There are different issues. High population is a challenge on natural resources as more bodies require more stuff.

Low birthrates is a challenge on economies. Humans are living longer and it takes a lot of people working to support a retired elderly person with medical needs.  Both in terms of literal hands (nurses, doctors, elderly care, pharmaceutical workers, cashiers and restsurant workers, etc) as well as tax payers contributing to retirement saftey nets."

NoStupidQuestions,"Films like Footloose have a clear narrative of old, conservative ideologies holding back freedom & progress. When political conservatives watch movies like that, do they identify with the antagonists? Or just not see a link between their behavior & that of the “close-minded townspeople” characters?","Let me put it this way. I’m assuming you’re a liberal (I am too). Consider the film Ghostbusters.  It’s a movie about people who leave academia to use their knowledge for financial gain in the private sector. The worst human character is from the EPA. It contains a clear narrative of government oversight causing the main characters nothing but trouble. 

When you were watching it, did you relate to the EPA character? I sure didn’t (in spite of environmental protection being a huge priority for me). Because that person is a “bad guy.” He was a pompous, condescending, ignorant ass who caused nothing but trouble, and reads as a clear antagonist. And when a character like that appears on the screen, no matter whether or not they’re on your “side” politically or philosophically, you don’t root for them. Because they’re asses. 

And we love the Ghostbusters because they’re the good guys! They’re funny, and clever, and know what they’re talking about so they’re right when the EPA guy is wrong. They’re the heroes. And I watch the film and never think “Yeah, you’re right: people should go unregulated by the EPA.” I’m thinking “Go, Ghostbusters!” 

And no matter how intellectual we are, or how much we care about issues, these levels of “good guys” and “bad guys” play a real role in our reaction to these movies. It lets us enjoy the narrative, no matter where we land on the political spectrum. And I suspect that when conservatives are watching movies with conservative villains, they are fully anti villain and pro hero. The same way we are when we watch Ghostbusters.

Yet she has 0 friends and complains of social isolation. Is this discrepancy something to be concerned with and what might the explanation be,"There are three possibilities I can think of: 

1. She has lots of acquaintances, but few friendships. She is agreeable but finds it hard to form deep friendships. 

2. There is some part of her personality that is abhorrent, and you won't know about it until you get to know her better. 

3. She is likeable, but introverted, so she *can* make friends, but she doesn't get out much."

NoStupidQuestions,Why isn’t the fact that men have to pay more for car insurance than women do considered discrimination?,"In the US, insurance companies have to get their rates approved by the State they are operating in. And if they can back up their claims with actuarial data to support that certain classes should be charged different rates, they will usually get approved, but they have to be careful. Young men pay more for car insurance. That levels out as you get older, like over 30 probably. Men pay more for life insurance than women, but women generally pay more for health insurance. Black folks paid more for life insurance than white folks until like the 80's. The actuarial tables backed it up. But that's wrong. And the states stopped letting them do that. Another thing they have been doing for the last several years is including credit score as a factor in car insurance rates.  They say that folks with lower credit scores make more insurance claims. They have the data to back it up. But a lot of states are starting to crack down on that. That's basically charging lower income people more for car insurance."

NoStupidQuestions,Boyfriend got someone fired over soap,"Your post history consists of you complaining about your boyfriend wanting to kill people and showing other red flags. If you want to dump him, just dump him. Stop seeking permission from strangers on the internet.

EDIT to include something I said to OP

> I hope you realize that I am not blaming you for your circumstances. I've been in a similar relationship type before. 

> I could have worded [my original comment] more gently so people wouldn't jump down your throat. I apologize for my harsh wording. I didn't know this would become the top comment, and my poor choice of words being at the top of this thread set the tone for people in the comments to be unreasonably cruel towards you. I am sorry for that.

> To rephrase myself, if I may, I would reword that as:

 > ""you know you are unhappy. Your own knowledge of your emotions is enough. Your emotions do not require the approval of strangers for them to be valid emotions. You do not need anyone's permission to feel your feelings.

> If you are unhappy, and it looks like you have been for a long time, you do not need to wait for things to explode past the point of no return for it to become justifiable to leave.

 > Leaving is a valid option simply because you are unhappy.

 > Being unhappy is, in and of itself, a perfectly valid and justifiable reason to end a relationship.

> I promise you that there is someone out there who will treat you better, no matter how much you might doubt it.""

> **Here are some things I wish someone had said to me when I was in your situation:**

> - Falling in love with potential leads to living in the future, in an idealized daydream, and the longer you daydream, the more unattainable your vision of the future becomes. At some point, when you've fallen in love with someone potential, you resign yourself to being unhappy in the present moment because you believe it will pay off eventually, and you'll get the idealistic future you imagine is possible. For bad partners, this mindset is the jackpot, because they know they can get away without changing and you'll keep convincing yourself they'll change eventually. You will put up with bullshit in the present because you believe so strongly in the future. But you will only ever live in the present. The future never comes. And if you keep going down this path, one day you will wake up and realize the future looks the exact same as yesterday.

> - You do not need 'one last conversation'. When you are hurt, it is natural for you to want to make the other person understand how bad they've hurt you. And when it's someone who claims to love you, that impulse is even stronger, so you'll stay in toxic situations for longer than you need to, continually having arguments over the same topics, all because you believe ""if I just use the right words, this one last conversation will finally make him see how much he's hurt me, and he'll finally get it, and he'll finally care.""

> **It won't happen.** You can't guilt someone into loving you. Real love comes on its own. It does not need to come about through persuasion. You cannot make someone care about you once they stop caring. You can give him the most perfect words, the most flawless logic, but at the end of the day, if someone does not care about your feelings, they will not care if they have hurt you. No matter what. 

> Magic words cannot force a person who does not value you to suddenly value you. If someone truly values you, they value you without needing to be convinced by an argument.

> ""One last conversation"" only gives them more of your emotional energy. It only gives them more power. It actually is ""one last chance for them to manipulate you into staying.""

> - The sunk cost fallacy will have you keep sinking. You cannot get lost time back, but you can prevent yourself from losing more time.


> - He doesn't need patience or help or sympathy from you for hurting you. You do not need to fix him. It is not your responsibility to rehabilitate the person who injured you. When you have been hurt, the only healing you should be focused on is your own. Not healing the person who hurt you."
NoStupidQuestions,"Is it more rude to flush the toilet after a late night piss and possibly wake up my roommate, or let it sit all night and have him see it when he wakes up before me in the morning?","So, to really maximize your rudeness for effort,  you're going to want to flush first, to wake him up, and THEN piss. That way he knows what's waiting for him later."
NoStupidQuestions,I grew up upper middle class and my parents often declined requests to eat out because it was “too expensive” or “unnecessarily expensive”. This included requests for fast food as well as sit down restaurants.

NoStupidQuestions,What is the deal with the bunny girl?,"According to the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2017/09/28/the-innocent-reason-hefner-named-playboy-girls-bunnies/):

""When Hefner was a student at Illinois University, in the 1940s, his favorite hangout was a bar called Bunny’s Tavern named after its original owner, Bernard “Bunny” Fitzsimmons. The bar, which opened in 1936, was a favorite for poverty-stricken students because of its 35-cent daily food specials and draft beer for 10 cents a glass. When Hefner set up his Playboy empire, in the 1950s, he came up with his rabbit logo and consequently the Bunny girls as a tribute, which he revealed in a letter to the bar which now hangs on its wall.""

But, they also say: ""However, he also admitted that the Bunny costume was a saucy reference to the sexual reputation of rabbits."" 

I think the truth is Hugh loved his time spent in that bar; with it's super cheap menu & one of the main places he got to see beautiful women every single day during his college years."

NoStupidQuestions,Why are Mexicans called immigrants but Canadians called expats when moving to the US?,"@OP I'm not sure if this helps, but if you're genuinely asking, an expat (which is short for expatriate) is a person who lives in another country, either permanently, or for an extended length. They usually keep their original nationality. 

An immigrant is defined as someone who has moved to another country permanently. Usually with immigrants, they intend to become citizens of the country they are living in."
NoStupidQuestions,How is the war in Ukraine still ongoing when it was revealed early on that Russia's military kind of sucks badly?,"Russia has a much larger population than Ukraine and they are willing to sacrifice them. They are also betting the West will get tired of the war before they do. And the sanctions on Russia have not had the desired effect due to countries like China and India buying Russian oil etc. And Ukraine can’t openly attack on Russian soil because NATO won’t support it. 

Also, it’s still winter in Ukraine and fighting should heat up — literally and figuratively — in spring. Ukraine has been stocking up on weapons from the West, but Russia has been digging in. It won’t be easy to recover all the territory Russia holds, especially Crimea and eastern Ukraine, which Russia held before this latest war started.

Edit: Yes, I’m aware that Europe is also purchasing gas from Russia, and also buying refined Russian oil from India. I did not blame India or call them a bad guy."

NoStupidQuestions,why are women and children prioritized in safety problems?,"Before the invention of birth control, population growth was capped by disease, famine, and war. Given how quickly populations grew when industrial farming and modern medicine became a thing, it's clear that there was a *lot* of premature death before that time. Humanity has a lot of experience with disasters of this kind, enough that societies have evolved to what works best.

When a society is forced by famine, war, or other catastrophes to lose a large fraction of its population, it can choose how to distribute those deaths by choosing which of its members face the highest risk. Societies that let their children die will encounter a bottleneck later down the road, where there are fewer young adults to take care of children and the elderly. Societies that let their women die will not be able to replenish as quickly if times suddenly become plentiful, causing them to be outcompeted. Societies that let their men die don't suffer nearly as much: the remaining men can impregnate all available women and keep the rate of children as high as possible, and men's physical strength is often most useful in dangerous situations as well. These upsides and downsides remain true until about 95% of men have died and the logistics of parenting become difficult.

In short: women and children's safety is traditionally prioritized in disasters because they're best at repopulating, so societies that prioritize them are more likely to survive and prosper."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why do people respond to public questions with ""I don't know""?",">  I can understand that if I had come to them specifically to ask ""Hey, do you specifically know what this is"" and that, in that situation, ""I don't know"" is an appropriate answer, 

IIRC, Amazon sends users e-mails with ""X has a question about [this product], can you help them?"" so they feel the need to give an answer."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why are vegetarian/vegan restaurants so expensive? Produce is cheap, meat is typically the expensive ingredient.","There's a lot of reasons mentioned in here, but one that isn't: they're niche. 

Conventional restaurants are looking to serve as much of the public as possible, so they can up their sales numbers and run on lower margins. A vegan restaurant is really only catering to a small portion of the public, but still have similar fixed costs to other restaurants. So, they need to be able to survive on fewer sales per day, which means higher margin per sale to break even."
NoStupidQuestions,Why is it legal for police to outright lie to you in the US when they are interrogating but illegal for you to lie to them?,"The ruling from the Supreme Court in the early 80's.

NoStupidQuestions,am i the only one who thinks that google search results are no longer accurate as it used to be?,"Three words: Search Engine Optimization.

There are people whose entire job is to make insignificant tweaks to sites to manipulate Google and other search engines to put their site higher in results lists. Google can try to change their search algorithm to fix this, but it turns into an arms race. Right now the SEO professionals are winning. The result is that your search results aren't based on what results are actually better for your needs, but instead are based on what websites can manipulate Google better."

NoStupidQuestions,Why do movies and shows romanticize toxic relationships and not healthy ones?,"From a writing perspective there are probably more narrative, character choices & drama, tension, stakes that you can build and reach more easily and quicker than trying to do all of that for a healthy relationship & still making it entertaining for an audience."
NoStupidQuestions,"People who sleep alone, do you sleep with your bedroom door closed?","A closed door will slow down the spread of a fire and may save your life.

I do laundry regularly while on the clock at home, takes like 3 minutes to run downstairs and start/switch loads. My work gives us 2 paid 15 minute brakes and an hour unpaid lunch. I usually use these to my advantage as well. I can shower on my first 15 minute break, prep dinner, fold laundry, do leftover dishes, sweep, etc on lunch. 

Making dinner easier is another thing to help. Make simpler/quicker meals, crockpot meals, or extra portions so you have leftovers."

NoStupidQuestions,"New York passed a law that says you cannot bring a gun to any “sensitive place” which basically means you cannot possess it in public (cannot bring it to Times Square) or on any private property unless a sign allows guns, but how doesn’t any of this violate the 2nd amendment?","Plenty of states have laws that restrict gun possession in specific areas, especially in sensitive areas. That idea by itself is usually fine, although New York seems to be taking it further than other states have. Remains to be seen how courts will react to that. 

This is all reacting to a recent Supreme Court ruling in the case *NYSRPA v. Bruen*, which struck down a New York gun control law that had previously been in place for about a century. The new laws were passed quickly, and are already being challenged in court."
NoStupidQuestions,Is it possible for a perfectly healthy person to suddenly die of natural causes in their sleep?,"A *seemingly* healthy person, yes.

NoStupidQuestions,Why are women stereotypically considered worse drivers when the statistics say that men have more crashes?,"I actually wrote a paper on this.  Weirdly enough. But that by no means makes me an expert, and it was a long time ago.  But here is the gist of what I found.

I am going to say ""women"" and ""men"" a couple of times, and I assume the audience is bright enough to realize I am not talking about all women or all men but more of the tendency of the spectrum.

Tests have shown that the vision of women is not as adept as men's to see where objects can fit in space, especially when it's moving or rotating.  This comes to fruition in a woman turning right on red in front of you statistically more than a man. Or making a lane change they clearly don't fit into causing a brake check.  Now before I get flamed, just hang on. 

Men are more willing to make high-consequence maneuvers while downplaying the danger especially at speed.  They also overestimate their skill and precision.  Also, they underestimate the effect of a would-be accident and aren't able to predict the damage as well as women.  That's why they drive like morons on the highway.  You see a car whipping around at 90 in a 55 bobbing and weaving through traffic, eventually killing someone?  A man.

What's most interesting, to me, is that when broken down on a per mile driven basis, women cause more accidents than men.  However, because the accidents are at a much lower speed, the accidents are not nearly as catastrophic as men's.  So at a low speed, a woman can make a mistake, but everyone has time to adjust, react, honk, and cuss.  Whereas a man may make fewer mistakes, but when one occurs it is usually at a higher speed ,  there is no reactionary time and it statistically causes a more catastrophic event.  Men are better drivers until they aren't and then they are the worst drivers, is my final (subjective) conclusion."
NoStupidQuestions,Why don’t mainstream conservatives in the GOP publicly denounce far right extremist groups ?,"A big thing for the conservatives/Republicans is party unity.

They don't want to be seen as having a lot of infighting. 

That is the optimistic reason. The pessimistic one is that they partially support those groups and don't want to alienate those voters."
NoStupidQuestions,How do I breach the subject of bad body odor to a child?,"My childhood best friend had the worst BO. I would chase him around with deodorant spray like it was a game. Then I showed him my 2 for 1 deodorant pack and said, ""Hey man, we can smell alike, and I don't need this extra one."" He would just blow me off like ""Nah, no thanks.""

My mom eventually threatened that he would not be allowed to stay over anymore, so I paid my brother to have the talk instead, and that corrected it.

I'm not a wuss.. I'm just good at delegating."

NoStupidQuestions,"When stating their pronouns, why do people write ""she/her"", ""he/him"", ""they/them"" etc. instead of just say ""she"", ""he"", ""they""?","Thanks to OP and everyone who has responded to this question. I’m a bit on the older side and had absolutely no clue what they were talking about when I had to filled out a questionnaire at the doctors office. They told me to provide pronouns and I listed he, she, they, them. They never said anything about it so I figured I answered correctly. NOW that I know what they meant, I’m laughing at what they must have thought when they read it."
NoStupidQuestions,Why do people joke that No Child Left Behind is the reason why so many American people are stupid today?,"One big criticism was the claim that it had an over reliance on standardised tests.   This lead to many schools and teachers doing what is called Teaching To The Test where you anticipate the sort of questions that standardised tests are known for and teach that.  One big criticism of standardised tests is that they're usually lower order tests (base level knowledge) and so teachers spent a lot of time going over and over basic knowledge on subjects and then only what they thought would be likely to be on the tests.  So the argument is that while test scores may have gone up it was in basic concepts and so the big picture of learning was missed.  Sure, students can tell you that something in history occurred on this date and list a few reasons why it happened but anything beyond that... well, standardised tests aren't known for caring much about that so weren't taught it."

NoStupidQuestions,(Realistic answers only) You're on the roof of a 2 story building with no ladder or fire escape. Time is running out. How do you get down?,"Fire Fighter here.  I doubt your guy is going to have the tools we have on us (over 150lbs of extra shit on our person, counting hand tools like Halligan or Chainsaw), but we have bailout kits with climbing rope attached to anchors.  For a roof escape, the anchoring to the chimney is your best bet.

With no bailout kit, a bush is a good target to aim for if you have to base jump.

Last option is waiting near the chimney.  The structure is strongest there.  We always have about 25 people on the ground working to get you down.

If he's by himself, no bushes, no bailout equipment or reasonable facsimile (like a bed sheet), then I would kick a rain gutter free at the very edge, lie down and grab the end of it, then roll off the roof.  The rain gutter will tear away from the roof one anchor point at a time and each anchor point will disrupt your inertia enough to slow your fall.  A metal rain gutter will probably cause some damage to you, but nothing you can't walk off.  PVC gutters will work the best.

NoStupidQuestions,wtf happened to online dating?,"Match Group is the company that owns like 90% of dating apps. Over the past decade or so they've been acquiring every dating service they can. I think they own Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, Okcupid, PoF, as well as a bunch of less popular ones. They don't want people to stop using them, so they've made it a point to make it harder to talk to people to discourage people and get them to pay for ""upgraded"" memberships by promising more matches. They've slowly shifted every app to the Tinder ""swipe left or right on random people"" model and that algorithm also hides your profile if you swipe right on too many people and they don't match with you. If you don't match with enough people you'll essentially get shadow banned after a while, so there's really not much point in putting effort into anything other than your photos. If you aren't getting matches it's better to just delete your profile and try taking better pictures to start over once the algorithm buries your profile. This drives away a lot of people, and the overall quality of people that are on dating sites drops because it encourages people to just spam creating accounts and starting over."
NoStupidQuestions,Why do chess players run away after a game?,"Chess tournaments are often scheduled with relatively tight schedules between games.

Between games there's very often not much time, so if you need to do things like eat or go to the restroom it's not always so easy to fit that in while the game is happening.

Many chess players are running because they're hurrying to get food. Many others are hurrying because they've been holding it for a long time and need to get to the bathroom."
NoStupidQuestions,Why do you never see cheese in any sort of Asian cuisine?,"In traditional Chinese culture there are several contributing factors:

1. Lactose intolerance.  Simple enough.
2. Cultural factors.  Chinese norms held a sharp distinction between the ""civilized"" folk who live behind walled cities, and ""barbarous"" nomads who lived on the outskirts.  Because dairy was something associated with nomadic/herding tribes, dairy as a food was considered uncouth.
3. Poor culinary compatibility with tea.  A while back some Western culinary experts did an experiment where they brought a variety of cheeses to China and had chefs who were experts in traditional Chinese cuisine taste them.  The chefs noted that the flavors of particularly pungent cheeses weren't all that dissimilar to stuff like stinky tofu.  The problem was that because cheese is more fatty and oil-based, its aromatic compounds couldn't be washed away easily with tea compared to the pungent elements in traditional Chinese cuisine.

EDIT:  Found the article I was thinking of!

[boop.](https://archive.is/j8iPk)

EDIT2:  I should specify (thanks to friendly reminders in the replies) that this mostly is a Han Chinese culture thing.  There are many minority groups in China that have a long standing tradition of consuming cheese and dairy. I once had fried cheese in Guilin, a specialty of the Bai ethnic group IIRC."
NoStupidQuestions,How do you respond to a war veteran who is proud of his kills?,"I would bet real money that this dude has never fired a shot in anger in his life. Air Force MPs aren’t known to get into a lot of TICs.

NoStupidQuestions,What is the point of a minimum wage if it is impossible to live on minimum wage?,"That is the point of a minimum wage.  The problem is that you can't just set one and expect it to be relevant forever.  It needs to be adjusted regularly.  In the US, the biggest problem is policy makers not agreeing on it being adjusted."

NoStupidQuestions,Do people actually find twerking attractive or is it some massive inside joke I'm not in on?,"People like seeing jiggly bits jiggle, so I imagine yea there’s probably a great number of people who enjoy seeing twerking. I am not one of them however.

NoStupidQuestions,"Why are extremely rich people, who have more money than they'll ever be able to spend, fight tooth and nail and buy politicians to avoid having their taxes raised a little?","I worked with a billionaire (not directly, but we were on a first name basis). He was a interesting kind of cheap. Would spend lavishly on property, travel, food, etc for himself and his family. I knew his assistant. He literally had no budget or concept of how much he spent personally. 

But for money coming in — very tight fisted. 

He ran a business and would penny pinch everything there. Underpaid staff, did questionable things (conflict of interest) just to get some single digit millions for himself. Used company finances ti pay for personal stuff whenever he could do it. Would negotiate insanely hard on deals and take everything he could. 

Honestly it felt almost like a compulsion. Like if he wasn’t getting every last tiny bit owed to him it would be a failure. I also think he’s a sociopath but that’s a separate thing. 

I also knew (also vague acquaintance) someone who had maybe $0.5B - not entire sure. He was super chill, didn’t spend a lot - you wouldn’t know he was wealthy. As with everything it depends on the person."

NoStupidQuestions,"If there’s supposed to be separation of church and government, why do laws keep getting passed with Christianity as the backing?",The government can't require church participation or prohibit it. There have been 'blue laws' like bars can't open on Sundays which in my opinion are Christian inspired. They've stood because on paper they are just a law. The statute as written is what gets tested by the courts more than a question about the possible intent of the law makers.
NoStupidQuestions,"If you’ve hooked up with a girl the night before, is it really not okay to wake her up with a kiss for example, because the consent is no longer there? Or is that consent still implied from the night before? I’m confused.","It's neither by default. Whether it's accepted/appreciated lies solely on the discretion of your partner receiving the kiss.

It's obviously not a big deal, because you were just vastly more intimate with the other person. But if the other person reacts in a negative way, you should immediately apologize and explain your sentiment.

TL;DR: being spontaneous is fine. Just be prepared to communicate."

I moved out of a very rural area at 18 but moved back 25 years later and the hardest thing to get used to was the fact that a large number of people I have never met know everything about me.

The conversation will often be about how they know a cousin of mine. 

The shits unsettling to me but everybody from here thinks it’s normal.

When they are standing around gossiping (talking shit) about everybody in a 30 mile radius one of your neighbors could have brought up how that car you bought is just sitting under a tarp. Hell the fact it’s under a tarp could have passed thru 5-10 people before it got to the car seller."

NoStupidQuestions,"A question from my 9-year old daughter that i can't answer. If Titan imploded like a tin can, why fishes do not.","This is a great question! The answer has a couple of parts to it.

* The reason the outside water pressure caused the Titan to implode was because inside the Titan was air at just 1 atmosphere of pressure. If the Titan's hatch was never shut, and it was just sunk from the surface, letting water inside, there would be no difference in pressure between the ocean outside and the water inside, so it wouldn't get crushed. Deep water doesn't inherently crush things, only a difference in pressure between inside and outside.

* Fish are adapted for the depths they live at. Fish actually have an organ called a swim bladder with gas in it to help them float at the correct depth in the water. If you go fishing and pull a deep sea fish to the surface, it has the opposite problem the titan had- the gas inside the fish is now at a higher pressure than the outside, and the fish will suffer from decompression sickness, could have a ruptured swim bladder, or even explode, with its guts and eyes popping out, the opposite of the Titan imploding. (edit: really far down, deep sea fish don't have swim bladders and just have slightly buoyant tissues, but have similar problems with being brought up)"

NoStupidQuestions,What does it mean to be “too self aware for therapy?”,"As a therapist I have literally never said this about a client, encountered another person (out in the world or in therapy) who I would describe this way, and have never heard another therapist describe a client this way. 

Consequently I would suggest that the state of “being too self-aware for therapy” does not actually exist and is something that people say  for some reason. 

TLDR: it is nonsense.

NoStupidQuestions,What is this prostitute card thing?,"Before cell phones were widespread, every telephone box in the UK had those business cards tucked in the cracks. Callgirls hired people (often kids, for 'paper round' amounts of money) to place them, so as fast as they were removed by telecom workers or parents who didn't want their kids to see them, they reappeared once more."
NoStupidQuestions,Is it discrimination if I refuse to date e.g. muslims on the basis that I don't want religion to have a role in my romantic relationships?,"The relationship market is one of the most discriminatory there is. And by that I mean discrimination in the original sense of the word: as in the opposite of ""indiscriminate"", but regarding preferences.

Given that a relationship is a large part of our lives, it's not only acceptable to make distinctions based on your preferences; it is vital.

And yes, that sadly also means that the relationship market is one of the most brutal markets there is."
NoStupidQuestions,Why are “in” and “on” used seemingly randomly in English and how do you explain the difference?,"This isn’t unique to English. Arbitrary preposition use happens in a lot of languages. The in and on thing for vehicles genuinely is determined by if you can walk around on the vehicle. A bus, plane and boat all are big enough that you can walk around so you are “on” them. A car generally can only be sat in so you are “in” the car. It’s not a perfect rule but it generally works."

NoStupidQuestions,In a world full of terrible parents why isn’t there some sort of official test/procedure you have to go through before you can be allowed to have a kid?,"When you say you realize how much of a moral dilemma it would be, there's a huge part of it. Who decides? How can you ensure it's actually fair and not biased in any way? How is it enforced? What are the punishments for not complying? How can you ensure any of that without massive human rights violations (you really can't)? 

Edit: where is the funding coming from to administer tests and maintain records? Where do kids from unlicensed pregnancies go, and where do the funds and caretakers for that come from? 

Another edit: several people have commented or messaged me regarding adoption and foster care having similar standards. Adoption and foster care currently has issues with discriminatory practices based on sexual orientation in several areas, so issues that I'd be concerned about if a general ""parenting license"" type process existed are already happening on a smaller scale."
NoStupidQuestions,"If you get filthy rich overnight, do you have a responsibility to change your friends' lives to the better?","I have a wealthy relative. He is very generous, but if people have an expectation that he'll pay because he can afford it, it robs him of the good feeling he gets when being generous. And over time he no longer spends much time with those people. 

He did give good advice if you win the lottery and want to share. Do not just give someone money. They'll spend it and be back at the trough for more. His suggestion is to put some money into a fund in your own name, but the interest earned goes to the family member you want to help. So for example if you win $100 million, you could set aside $1 million and the $40,000 a year of interest goes to the family member. It's a huge help to them, but it's also built in that every month they get a decent cheque. Not enough to quit a job, but lots of fun to spend. It also stops them from asking for more and encourages good behaviour as at any time you can stop the transfer of funds."

NoStupidQuestions,Why does the CGI from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise still look so good 15-20 years later and in some cases better than modern CGI?,"They used practical effects for a lot of it, the ~~2nd~~  EDIT: 3rd Pirates movie was one of the most expensive movies ever made because they made some MASSIVE practical sets for it.  The whirlpool battle scene in particular was crazy as both ships were practical sets that followed the whirlpool motion, the CGI in those scenes were used just for the background elements.

It's the same reason the CGI in Jurassic Park holds up so well, they just used it where they needed to use it so for stuff that really mattered in the foreground they could focus on getting it perfect."

He pretty much put all the weight on me to decide what to do. I got married because I didn't want him to have issues with his family. 

After we got divorced he moved in with the girl he was cheating on me with. His parents haven't disowned him!"

NoStupidQuestions,What's up with the new Velma show and why is there so much backlash?,"The show seems to not know who it is for, it's an adult cartoon that bashes adults that watch cartoons and has lots of juvenile humour. 

It also angered Scooby-Doo fans for changing the characters (Shaggy is completely unrecognisable except for his green shirt), Scooby-Doo isn't even in it and the characters are as unlikable as possible. 

All this adds up to an unfunny cartoon that's unsuitable for kids, bashes the target audience and has no respect for the source material so people have been speaking out against it and how awful it is. Kinda like when Morbius released only people are frustrated instead of laughing at it"
NoStupidQuestions,"Ho do you respond to ""I've dated a black guy before. It's not for me.""","I dated, people are awful, can't honestly recommend it."
NoStupidQuestions,"People who wear very little on an airplane, why?","A lot of people think planes are cold but I get motion sick and it’s exacerbated by being too warm. Also some people are more comfort in a colder environment. My daughter wears shorts all winter. She’s never cold.

NoStupidQuestions,Do you wash new clothes before wearing them?,"I worked in a garment factory as a kid and believe me... you want to wash them before wearing.

NoStupidQuestions,Why the hell is it 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) in the beginning of November?,"Just to add a bit more than ""it's climate change"": The Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest warming bodies of water in the world. Arctic sea ice no longer reaches as far south as it used to and therefore doesn't cool and redirect the Labrador current into the GoM to the extent that it used to. That current would also push the Gulf Stream farther east towards Europe. Without the Labrador current we are seeing more warm water in the area. The northeast US is likely to see warmer winters and more storms as a result."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why does the term ""African-American"" exist when others get stuff like ""Irish-American"" or ""Chinese-American""? Why isn't there ""Ugandan-American""?",">Why isn't there ""Ugandan-American""?

There is.  A person who emigrated to the US from Uganda would be that. 

The reason that we have the term ""African-American"" is because Americans descended from slaves kidnapped from Africa over 500 years do not have any way to trace their specific origin."

NoStupidQuestions,My dad and final living parent passed away last night. Is it normal to feel a little like an orphan even thought I'm in my 30's?,"I'm sorry for your loss. Nothing in grief is ""weird."" Grieving is a process and everyone deals with it in their own way."

NoStupidQuestions,"People whose butt cracks regularly hang out of their pants , do you not notice or do you not care ?","Sooooo bigger guy here. I actually never knew my asscrack hung out when I was in highschool. Until I was attending an assembly and I overheard the kids behind me talking about it and laughing. I was horrified and excruciatingly embarrassed.

Ever since then I developed... Not a complex, that's too strong a word... A compulsion to always make sure my clothes properly cover my asscrack."
NoStupidQuestions,Is there a point in adult life where boredom is all you can expect from now on?,"This sounds anhedonic (""a lack of pleasure""); same root as ""hedonism"".

Anhedonia is a part of depression. Like... Eeyore is anhedonic. He doesn't weep, and he isn't on the verge of taking a short walk off a tall cliff... he just doesn't feel much, or have any ambition, and can't find pleasure in things.

It's probably not going to be an imminent danger to the life of yourself or others...

...but on a long enough timeline, stress and depression lower quality of life, and lower the duration of life. Retirees with no social lives and/or no hobbies tend to deteriorate quickly and live much shorter lives, for instance.

Therapy, and/or burnout recovery, and/or self-reflection, development of new relationships (platonic)/introduction to new social circles, et cetera, tend to be things that are recommended. Given that I’m not a psychologist, nor your psychologist, I can't really provide diagnosis or treatment...

but I can provide the advice that you should see a therapist."

NoStupidQuestions,"In the English language, is there a scenario where the word “my” is followed by a comma?","Oh my, what a silly question."
NoStupidQuestions,Aftercare of an anus tattoo?,"A friend of mine is a tattoo artist. He says he's only done a few but this is what he recommends:

""The person getting the tattoo should talk to their doctor about a healthy liquid diet that they can go on for a few weeks. They should start the liquid diet at least 3 days before the tattoo and continue on it for at least 2 weeks after being tattooed. This prevents rough matter from scraping it or it getting blown out by pushing too hard. 

No toilet paper can be used for the first 2 weeks, minimum. I recommend a bidet or a shower after each bm.

Regular tattoo aftercare can be applied twice a day and rash cream (for babies) can be used in between if it's getting irritated.

You can't really bandage the area but you can add second skin film for the first few days. It doesn't stay on super well though and needs to be checked constantly to make sure things don't get under it. Good cleaning is better though.""

I hope that helps answer your question!


Edit: The rash cream is baby diaper rash cream, not a recommendation to use that on baby's anal tattoos. 🤣 I just copied his text to me and didn't think to clarify."

NoStupidQuestions,My friend has no idea he is about to be divorced.,What good comes from you telling him rather than her? This isn't a case of you finding her cheating and her not saying anything.  Just wait for the call from him and check on him if you don't get it within a couple days.
NoStupidQuestions,What’s with “alpha male” concept when the whole thing was already debunked by the original scientist?,"People like easy solutions to complex problems, people also like to feel special,

So some people like to think ""if I become an alpha all my problems will be solved, woman will love me, men will want to be me, and my dick will grow 4 inches longer!"",

And some like to think ""damn I'm cool, I must be one of those alphas, yeah that sounds badass, I'm an alpha!"",

And then there are ~~grifters~~ salesman who market self help, but for ~~edgy dorks~~ cool people, and use the term to make it seem like it's at least kind of scientific ""if you buy my course you can be cool like me too, this (debunked) paper (about wolf's which is not applicable to humans) even says this is science so you know it's legit!"",

This is a bit of an oversimplification but that's about how these things go"

NoStupidQuestions,Where can an adult learn math?,"I've heard khan academy has been the go to for free adult learning online. Never used it myself, but it always has glowing reviews


Also my pro tip, go back to the basics. If you're like me, you grew up in an era where they only taught basic mult/division one way and that one way never fully clicked for me, which then made me struggle the rest of my life in more advanced math bc I only had a loose grasp on the foundations.

When I went to college I was originally an elementary edu major, so one of my math classes was ""how to teach basic math"" so I got to relearn different methods of mult/division that didn't exist or weren't widely taught when I was a kid. Found a way that actually worked for me in my brain. Suddenly I can do multiplication in my head. Changed my life lol."
NoStupidQuestions,Am I wrong to refer to my neighbors as 'Mexican'?,"As some who is Mexican, I would prefer being called Mexican over Hispanic. Hispanic is very broad, calling me Mexican is more personal and it’s what I would prefer. Latino is good too, I would also prefer that over Hispanic.

The thing is, though, that a lot of people make the assumption that any Latino or Hispanic person they meet is Mexican. I’ve had friends in school who were asked if they were Mexican, to which they had to respond no, which was not the answer they were expecting. It’s kind of like how Asian people are often grouped into being Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, even though being Asian spans a lot further than just that. I hope this made sense lol."
NoStupidQuestions,How do canaries know to sing when trouble is brewing? Are they trained to do this or born that way to alert other canaries to danger?,"They don't sing in coal mines, they have tiny lungs and are susceptible to gases.

NoStupidQuestions,Gf threatening to break up if I watch the 2022 fifa world cup. What should I do?,Is it possible she’s looking for an excuse to end the relationship?

NoStupidQuestions,Why does the lining on women's underwear have an unstitched opening?,The lining is to add an extra layer to absorb any discharge. Why is it unstitched on one side?

NoStupidQuestions,What is Donald Trump being convicted of exactly?,"""The difference between indictments, convictions, and charges can be confusing.

NoStupidQuestions,"A lot of people on the Internet are claiming that in case of a military draft they will be dodging it by going AWOL/in the woods. But seriously, are there really that many people thinking that they will manage to evade a military draft? Is everyone going to pull an “Into the Wild »?",">But seriously, are there really that many people thinking that they will manage to evade a military draft?

Over half a million people used illegal methods to avoid the draft last time the US had one. Less than ten thousand were convicted. That's a 98% success rate for just not showing up and pretending to not be home if someone comes to get you. 

A hundred thousand went for an extended vacation. 

Around 14 million people used legal methods to avoid the same draft. Strictly speaking lying about having asthma and poor eyesight is probably illegal, but the trick is to pretend you're a politician and go ""I believe that"" before every sentence."
NoStupidQuestions,Guy I am dating is frustrated because I never let him pay for dinners and other things. Should not he be happy?,He wants to contribute to the date.  He feels like he’s taking advantage of your kindness.  I’d be frustrated too.
NoStupidQuestions,"Why does it seem like all these crazy laws like book banning, information control in schools, and women's reproductive rights are being passed seemingly unopposed?","Because only highly politically engaged people vote in primaries, so we tend to get extreme candidates.  Meanwhile, mainstream Republicans can be counted on to turn out, but mainstream Democrats will just stay home if there isn't a candidate they're excited by."
NoStupidQuestions,A hotel is claiming I smoked in the room and won't return the fee. I'm a non-smoker. What can I do?,"Name and shame publicly.  Don't have a Twitter account?  Start one, and tweet at the company and ask why they're charging a $300 fee to a non-smoker.  

If it's a major chain, that usually gets their customer service reps to go ""whoa whoa hang on a sec, let's fix this"".  Same with airlines."
NoStupidQuestions,Is CPR a universal term? If I'm in another country would asking for CPR get me the necessary medical attention?,"CPR is not a universal term, although people may still recognise it.

Although if you're going to be worrying about needing to shout about CPR, you can always just shout ""Help"" as well as learn CPR yourself.

*edit: I didn't think OP was going to attempt CPR on themselves, because when you need CPR it is probably a bit too late to attempt it - I meant primarily to save another person.*"

NoStupidQuestions,How stupid does an attempt to kill somebody have to be before it stops being a crime?,"This is insanely interesting. You are right, you can openly threaten to curse someone, it happens all the time. 

I would guess once it passes into ""other people believe this could work"" would define it. 

Like, if enough people believe that invoking Poseidon will kill them, it would probably count as terrorism. But if you plant a ""bomb"" that everyone fully knows is fake, it's probably fine. I mean shit, that's how movies use props, they just clearly tell everyone they are totally fake."

NoStupidQuestions,Why don’t we hear anything disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle anymore?,"Look at it like this:  The Bermuda Triangle is fucking huge, and also has a a history of heavy ship traffic, and is generally in the area where most Atlantic hurricanes form and transit.  Also, until fairly recently in history, once a ship left port it was very difficult (or impossible) to communicate with them.  So, lots of ships, dangerous waters, huge area, and lack of word from ships going missing led people to believe there was something supernatural going on when there wasn’t."

NoStupidQuestions,"If I hit a car going 50 miles an hour, and that car was also going 50 miles an hour at me, is it a cumulative force of 100 miles per hour?","Sort of, yes, but also no. 

The amount of force applied across both vehicles is the same as one of them hitting a wall at 100 mph, yes. 

However, assuming the two vehicles are the same size and weight, the amount of force on each individual car (and therefore its occupants) is the same as that car hitting a wall at 50 mph, because the force of the collision is spread across both cars. 

Mythbusters did an episode on this that does a better job of explaining it."

Then a while later one branch of animals evolved the extremely clever concept of ""lets have the shit come out a second hole"" - and rather than going in to the mouth then back out of the mouth, food instead went in one end and waste went out the other.

With this adaptation there were now two possible choices of where sperm and eggs could come out - either the mouth, or the anus.

Our ancestors used the anus - so sperm/eggs, urine and shit were all coming out of the same hole, but hey at least it wasn't the hole we were eating with anymore, so that was an improvement. This sperm/egg+urine+shit hole is known as a cloaca.

[Then some animals developed lungs; which needed to be attached to one of the two holes in order to function properly. You may be thankful that the successful adaptation of lungs had them attached to the eating-hole, not the shitting-hole.

~~Then some lucky animals developed a split in the mouth hole, generating a new nose-hole (that developed into two nostrils) specifically for breathing through.~~

EDIT: as /u/archosauria62 pointed out, I had the evolution of the nose-holes at the wrong point. They actually evolved before lungs, seemingly for the purpose of the sense of smell.]

Some time later ""internal fertilisation"" was developed, which meant that the cloaca of females had to take an *input* from the male's cloaca, as well as outputting eggs.

Even later, the cloaca split into three holes - all of which had to remain close to each other, because evolution is a very conservative process - the Urethra, through which urine travels; the anus, which releases solid waste; and the Vagina or the seminal canal depending on whether the specimen was male or female.

In males it was useful to have an appendage that could be inserted into the female to transfer sperm - and having such an appendage it makes sense to push the urethra through that to allow easier removal of waste.

Females don't truly have such a structure, although a partial mirror of it exists in the Clitoris, so the Urethra just sits in that general area - but they do need a much larger hole for eggs or babies to pass through, thus developing a vagina that sits next to the Anus, allowing it to stretch more easily by taking up the room that would otherwise be used for the anal cavity."
NoStupidQuestions,Are Supreme Court Justices untouchable? It seems like Clarence Thomas has a new bribe discovered every week. Some are just flat out obvious like he doesn't care.,"They can be removed from office upon impeachment, which requires a majority vote in the House, and then conviction, which requires a 2/3rds vote in the Senate. That idea is DOA because the Republicans would never vote to remove a justice who supports them so consistently."
NoStupidQuestions,What can be done about sticky balls?,"He may need to change his underwear. Different style, maybe larger size."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why is Jap offensive, but Pole, Swede, Scot, etc. not?",Same reason any word is offensive: because many people use it an offensive way.
NoStupidQuestions,"Why can doctors be an hour late to an appointment, but if I’m 10 minutes late, I can’t be seen and have to pay a fee to return? Most doctors I’ve gone to it’s been over a half hour after my appointment time before I’m seen.","There were times when doctors took more time to help me, and delaying next person’s appointment. That is why I, personally, do not get too upset about being delayed."
NoStupidQuestions,How do you politely let your friend know they need to shower more often?,"At that point, there is no polite way anymore. You just have to tell him that he needs to take a shower because of his work and hobbies before he comes over. You are friends, you can have a chat about that"

NoStupidQuestions,"Are Americans generally paid enough so that most people can afford a nice home, raise 2 children, and save enough for retirement, or has this lifestyle become out of reach for many despite working full time jobs?","I’m a teacher engaged to another teacher and had a sad chuckle typing this. 

No."
NoStupidQuestions,People usually don’t text unless I text first. Does that mean no one likes me :( or could people just bet used to me texting first?,"I've gone my entire life feeling like my friends never call or text, and even when they visit town they rarely let me know. I know that they love me, and I have a great relationship with all of them, but I'm just not really a fun person, and now that I've pulled into my 30's I've realized that I'm really just that reclusive hermit that when they do come to me it's because they need my help. I don't mind, because that's just who I am. We all have our roles to play, and mine is reading and playing video games, and in all honesty, I don't want to go out anyways. 

Long story short, be there for others but don't ever depend on them for your happiness because you may find your disappointment turning into resentment, which is unhealthy and then you end up being the bad guy."
NoStupidQuestions,"Why are most of the people in r/amiugly, pretty?",Actually ugly people don't need anyone to tell them. They are well aware.
NoStupidQuestions,Why do people vehemently dislike Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?,I think when he says shit like “I never got the chance to ride a bike as a kid” when there are innumerable pics and videos of him riding bikes as a kid tends to make people think he’s trying to recast himself in an inaccurate light.
NoStupidQuestions,"Why does alcohol still taste like shit? I'm 21, the drinking age is 18 where I am. All my peers already drink. I find beer and wine disgusting and can barely tolerate the taste of vodka and lady drinks (as a dude.) When does it get better?","You just dislike the taste of alcohol, or of most alcoholic drinks.

I hate olives, but I know lots of people who can't get enough of them. On the other hand, I quite like a ham and pineapple pizza, which to vast numbers of people is the most disgusting thing ever.

But that's fine, it's just a matter of personal taste. You don't like beer or wine. Just because your friends enjoy alcohol doesn't make you a failure -- you do you, and if your friends give you a hard time about it, you need better friends."
NoStupidQuestions,Why aren't police officers required to maintain certain level of athleticism and weight maintenance?,"This is a controversy where I live right now. All of our Deputies are morbidly obese. One actually uses a scooter while off duty to do shopping. 

There was an incident in which some locals went off the side of a steep roadside in their truck, and needed help. Several able-bodied adults (I was one of them) were there, and trying to help them...but a 400lb deputy showed up, and after he caught his breath after the 50 foot walk from his vehicle left him wheezing, ordered us to get back so that he could do... Well I don't know what he had in mind, but all he ended up doing was standing around sweating until paramedics arrived.

I mean, maybe not athletic... But at least a basic level of human function might be a good start."
