DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that, from a certain age, elderly people should be tested to see if it's still safe for them to drive?","In NZ ""You need to renew your driver licence at age 75, age 80, and every two years after that."" You also need like a medical certificate from your docter and can be referred for an on road test.

Dunno where you are and what rules there are"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think gender reveal parties are dumb?,"I do, and for the record I also think the Pope wears a funny hat."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE type out a whole post or reply but immediately think ""wow no one gives a shit"" and delete the whole thing before posting?",How many times did you delete and retype this post?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stay up too late despite needing to sleep because you don’t want your free time to end?,Story of my life since I was a teenager now almost 30 lol
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not really care about how tidy a friend's/family's place is but is super critical of their own when having visitors?,I am exactly this kind of person.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it’s crazy how many people think it’s ok to watch loud videos and talk on speaker phone in public?,"Makes me crazy. Unless you’ve been living in a cave, everyone knows you do not listen to videos on a plane without a headset of some kind. Well, apparently the one surviving cave dweller sat down beside me the other day on a flight. It’s dead quiet, middle of the night, and she’s watching screeching videos of a toddler. I look up from trying to sleep and say, “Uuummm…. maybe the flight attendants probably have some ear buds?” 
She says, “Whatever. Just go to sleep.”  
I WAS ASLEEP YOU WACK JOB."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE watch TV with subtitles even though you're not deaf and you're watching a show in your native tongue?,Yes because the action scenes are like imax sound and the dialogue is like whispering
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that everyone is being too overly calm about how expensive everything has become?,I think it's less about being calm and more that a lot of people are trying to not think about it because it's too depressing.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have “inside clothes” that you were never wear in public?,"Oh dude. I've got inside clothes, around the property clothes, going into town clothes, going into the city clothes..."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the quality of clothing has gotten terribly worse and their prices have gotten higher?,Feel like this goes for a lot of products.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE who wears glasses sometimes try push their glasses up when they aren't wearing them?,Yes. 36 year old glasses wearer. I tried contacts over the summer and could not help to try and push my nonexistent glasses up
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think a work week should be less than five days?,"There are studies that seem to say that companies that go from a five day to a four day work week have no loss in productivity. Also yes, I'd like to work less."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE love running their fingers through their hair and over their scalp looking for crusty bits?,I totally do this too!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think about changing their lifestyle before going to sleep knowing pretty well that tomorrow when you wake up you will keep living the same way?,Every single night. Always making big plans and then just wake up to do the same thing over and over.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else think about how easily you can create chaos around you if you really wanted to,"There was a comedian (cant remember their name) who commented on how weird it is that you need an ID to buy glue, but you are just one Amazon click away from buying a stack of road cones and making traffic go anywhere you want.  

I think about this often."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE restart a song in the middle because you haven’t enjoyed it like it deserves?,"Yes, especially if I go out of my way to find the song in my library and hit play just to have my mind wander or get distracted by a text. I will realize I haven't really ""listened"" to the song, so I will restart it"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stop the microwave with a second left just so you don’t have to hear the annoying beep?,"I used to do this, and then I realized I could change the sound settings. Now, it never beeps and it makes me happy every time I use it"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE who is a young adult find that all of their friends are suicidal or at the very least hopeless and depressed?,A lot of people around me seem extremely depressed too. I feel horrible about not having the mental capacity to be there for everyone.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE poop with the door open when you’re home alone?,How else will the cat get in?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel absolutely drained by a 40h work week?,"I was in the same boat. Drove an hour to work every day as well. It gets to be a lot. The best thing I could do was try to find something, no matter how small, to look forward to every day after work. Even if it was just watching a game on tv, playing a video game, trying a new meal, etc. I feel like that helped me at least a bit. I got lucky though. At the beginning of this year my workplace introduced 4 day work weeks, so now I have 3 day weekends. The difference really is amazing. Any way you can flex your hours to get even one shorter workday? All the best to you friend"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE wish they could read a description of themselves? Like how a writer would describe a character in a book. Personality, appearance, traits, how people view you, etc.",My self esteem would never recover from this.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE realize that from the age of 5 to the age of 65 we’re expected to report to school/work Monday-Friday, 40+ hours a week?","I agree we are in work and school way too much. But it has taken me awhile to realize that the world, especially our society in the US, doesn’t care about our wellness. The goal is not for each citizen to feel happy, well, or fulfilled. The goal is to squeeze as much money or work out of them as we can. So it keeps the rich richer if the rest of us work overtime to meet basic costs of living, and then are too exhausted to make decent food so we drive thru somewhere terrible for us. We do this over and over until we are overweight and riddled with preventable disease. So we can die and make room for a younger worker with more energy to take over."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want to beat the shit out of the shower curtain when it won’t stop touching you?,Like getting groped by a plastic ghost.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE put water on the toothbrush before actually putting the toothpaste?,"Water, toothpaste, water!"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else sometimes wish they would die in their sleep?,"I’ve had this thought off and on for decades and I will admit that it creeps back in from time to time. The difference between now and 15 years ago is I really know I have things I look forward to seeing. I want to meet my future children, I want to live in a house that I own, I want to grow a garden with purple potatoes in it. Life is hard and times can be overwhelming and I often feel useless or unfulfilled but I probably haven’t heard the funniest joke yet. It isn’t much to get me through the day but it’s enough. That’s all I need though, enough to get through the day and get out of bed tomorrow."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get paranoid that everyone is secretly uncomfortable with you and they're only nice because they feel bad?,"I tend to approach every social interaction from the perspective that I'm annoying and unlikable, and that I shouldn't impose myself on people. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure this comes across as me not liking anyone else, since I tend to avoid social situations unless I've been explicitly invited, and I pretty much never invite other people places or initiate one-on-one conversations. Kind of results in it being a self-fulfilling prophecy."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think men peeing sitting down is totally acceptable?,It keeps the bathroom clean
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get super nervous when knowing you have to go somewhere in an hour or so,"An hour? Dear stranger, I am super nervous the second my eyes open on a day that I have to leave my house. 

Yes. The answer is yes. LOL..."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think their refrigerator doesn't need to connect to the internet?,"Nope. Neither does my toaster, dishwasher, microwave, or vacuum cleaner."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like stupid people are the majority?,"Stupid people are generally louder people. Not only in volume but just in general they draw attention to themselves with greater frequency than the average person. It creates the illusion of greater numbers. Also when you’re not a generally stupid person but you slip up and do something stupid, someone will notice and label you stupid in their own tally. So you’ve upped the number of stupid even if you don’t belong in that category overall

Source: I’ve been known to be stupid from time to time"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have dreams that it’s finals week and you suddenly remembered a class you forgot about all semester, even though you graduated years ago?",Yes! I thought I was the only one. I always find out there was a class I just didn't go to the entire time. Also sometimes I dream that I'm back in highschool as an adult because i didn't have enough units to graduate or something.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think the quality of life these days just f*cking sucks?,"I think it’s hard because we’re told to chase our dreams but when we finally meet all the requirements for that career we’ve been longing for, we can’t find a job. And that’s even with an attainable career, not like being a movie star."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think giving birth is a really crazy thing that a lot of women are asked to do?,This is why it’s important to think about your partner being an equal parent. Would they look after a baby if you’re in pain? Would they contribute to childcare regardless of your availability? Does/would your partner consider you to be the “default parent”? (absolutely hate that term). Is your partner a good person? Do they treat you with respect? There’s all these factors that people overlook because they just want a cute little baby that they don’t seem to realise will grow up.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE see a car with a dent, then you watch them drive for a bit, and think ah that's why",Defensive driving courses actually teach you to stay away from cars with body damage because it’s evidence that they’re distracted drivers lol
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think there should be no Christmas decorations, music, ads etc. until December?","A store near me already has valentines shit on their shelves. Too much, too soon, guys."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE spend their weekends doing absolutely nothing and avoid any sort of connection with the outside world like a plague?,I was going to say “yes” but then I realized I’m still trying to connect with the outside world by talking to people about not talking to people.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE, feel like parts of their personality or soul has died over the last few years?","Man, so here’s an oddly comforting thought that occurred to me a little while back:  
Everyone’s social muscles atrophied during the lockdown and more turbulent years of Covid.

People I love and know very well, and who had great social skills & acumen became more awkward, angry, shy, lacking self-confidence, affectionately stunted, rude, etc.. Not all were visibly more affected than others but everyone I know changed.  

I coped by empathizing, acceptance, and forgiving others as well as myself. Nothing is set right. Nothing is the same. It won’t be. One good takeaway on my end is understanding; the darkest days of Covid changed everyone. You’re not alone in the least."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever think about how strange the human experience really is?,it's very strange. and imo the stangest thing is that we have a consciousness that is able to reflect on this.
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else immediately stop watching when a video says ""watch to the end""?",Yep! That’s an indication that the video will be unnecessarily long.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE start choking on their own saliva out of no where sometimes?,"Exactly the same, my eyes are tearing up and everything. Happens to me at least twice a week."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE grow up thinking you're ugly only to realise you are moderately attractive?,"I'm face blind and have issues with faces in general. I can recognize myself but I just can't process how I compare against others. I have been told I'm pretty but I look at myself and see forehead and teeth because of how my brain is wonkerdoodle. 

I hate picture taken of me because of the mirror effect not being there. It's like an uncanny valley version of my face and my brain is like WOOOGAWOOGA IMPOSTER!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE onIy uses reddit on a smartphone?,Smartphone 100% of the time for casual browsing! I’ll use Reddit on my computer if I’m looking something up and google isn’t helping (ex. how to use xyz ‘reddit’)
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get shamed for being a night owl and ""sleeping in"" regularly by family and friends?","I’m the same. My dad shames the crap out of me for not being up at 6aM and waking up at 11AM. I got to sleep at like 4-5 ish in the morning. I think it’s a super power to be able to stay up late and be productive. With that being said, I feel like people like us people can wake up when necessary in the morning. Also it’s Ramadan which contributes more to being a night owl."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they've gotten dumber during the past few years?,"Yes absolutely. I think depression is eating my brain somehow. I used to be brighter than this. I'm now less than a regular person. I used to be unique for my mind and teachers and adults were impressed with me as I was ""smart beyond my years"". Now as an adult, I barely do my everyday routine. No hobbies no interests no talent."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they aren't anyone's favorite person?,"I feel like this A LOT. You're not alone but hey even we can be our favorite. I'm working on making myself my favorite, it was hard but i'm making progress. Now, I'm starting to feel more secure with myself"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE accidentally screenshot their Lock Screen at least 3x per day?,Yep! But *actually* trying to take a screenshot I turn my phone off at least 2wice
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Not care about New Years?,"I honestly haven't felt any of the holidays this year, it's been a rough year of depression for me. I'm just going to spend the day watching some movies and catching up on laundry."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like they're not ""living"" and they're just ""killing time"" until our death?",Am I killing time; or is time killing me?
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else find job interviews very humiliating?,"The interview is also set up more like an interrogation rather than a get-to-know-the-candidate affair. Tell your interviewees what the questions are beforehand so they can prepare rather than sandbagging them. If the candidate is lazy or not a good fit, they will either not prepare or come off as insincere when they answer your questions. 

Companies treat interviews as “gotcha!” sessions when they should be treating them like meetings. You won’t want your employee being sandbagged in a meeting so you shouldn’t want your candidate to be sandbagged in an interview.

Companies are interviewing for a role not trying to solve a murder. They should act better."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE brush their teeth ""extra good"" before a dentist appointment thinking it will make a difference with your how checkup goes?",Does it…not?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find Jimmy Fallon extremely irritating?,i never feel like i ever see the real Jimmy.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like everything is getting more expensive, yet the quality is decreasing?","Literally everything. It's probably going to get worse, too."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that politicians in Texas are confused? I mean, abortion should be illegal because ""all life is sacred"" yet, they will murder your ass if you commit a crime?",I would like to know: who benefits from banning abortion?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE before they visit a restaurant study the menu on the website and decide what they're having like 3 days before?,Yeah because i wanna make sure i even want to eat there
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find the notion that our deceased loved ones are “always watching over us” extremely creepy?,"Hey, if grandpa wants to watch me jerk off, that's HIS problem. Old pervert."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE type out a whole post or reply but immediately think ""wow no one gives a shit"" and delete the whole thing before posting?","For me it's more like 'wow no one gives a shit, not even me.'"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Think it’s an asshole move when your S/O sets multiple alarm’s and just keeps snoozing them?,"I think it’s inconsiderate, especially if they wake up earlier than you. I know when this has happened to me in the past it prevented me from going back to sleep my day to sleep in. But I also think it’s a conversation that should be had with your SO."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stop reading posts when the grammar/punctuation is horrible?,I do if I have to read the same sentence multiple times to understand it. Or if there's no punctuation.  I can forgive basic errors. But I give up when there's a basic unreadability
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they had 2-3 years deleted from their life cause of pandemic and our memories and sense of time is all messed up?,"I dont feel like it was deleted, i feel like it was a long walk through an unexpected hallway"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sometimes look at their pets and think “wow these wild animals are really just chilling in my house”?,"I took in a cat from his litter 15 years ago. My ex ran a stable to was too old to modern standards and a stable cat had a litter of kittens there. 

We opted for a short haired one, but ended up with Theoball, the long haired little guy who kept coming to us and sitting on our shoe.... of all things. A Norwegian forest cat, mostly, many asked if this giant was a mainecoon. I've got no idea, he never told me either. 

The dude needed quite a few years to discover tummy rubs and never really sat on my lap, but he got addicted to falling asleep to me giving him infinite tummy rubs. To the extent he'd greet me at the door and try to pull me towards the sofa to cuddle. I had to explain to people babysitting him (at their place) that if he would come and go he would be trying to ""pull you"" towards his point of interest, be that food bowl or the door etc. 

The fact that he was semi feral but eventually learned that I was nothing but an agent of good is probably some of the most rewarding stuff in my life. As he was diagnosed with kidney failure after a long period of weird vomiting I really had the opportunity to cherish (yes this isn't facebook, but still) the time with him that lasted a good 1.5 years. 

We was god damn annoying at times, but he was virtually never alone, never put in a cage when I was on holiday etc, always with someone willing to babysit him. 

The fact that this guy always came home, always greeted me at the door, preferred being in the same room as me or next to me for cuddles is probably the best buddy story of my life.

I often think about this interspecies symbiosis that hardly benefits humans at a tangible level at all, but I am really thankful for the near 15 years he got. I put him down when he stopped eating and got really skinny, and I had promised myself to be there all the way (due to those SoMe posts about pets looking for their owner). 

We also annoyed him, he hated loud noises if he perhaps was a bit sleepy or miffed for any reason: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTbP5Cf\_EAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTbP5Cf_EAA)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE in the US feel like the general public is becoming more hostile and racist in your daily life?,whelp today I went to Subway for lunch and the guy in front of me paid for everyone behind him (four of us total) so for today at least I feel hopeful for humanity.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else genuinely not want to be famous?,I would like less people to know of my existence if possible
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that SNL is incredibly, and without fail, totally not funny?","As a UK watcher I've always found SNL to be an incredibly hit n miss experience.  To me it seems that they come up with a single funny idea, then try to build a scenario/moment centered around it but struggle to keep it going after the funny idea has been spent too early in the skit.  Then it's just 5 minutes of unfunny/boring, and I know it can't be helped but the looking at the cue cards thing is really distracting.

When they land they land well (Wayne's World is still in my top 5 of all time, Blues Brothers top 10), but when they fail they're just boring."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else fear the looming fascism in the US?,"Yeah, at 40 years old it certainly feels more possible now than I ever thought it would  be in my lifetime in this country.  Real bummer.  I cannot understand the mentality of someone who would be so eager to give up their autonomy for anything, much less for the assholes who are trying to declare themselves in charge."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE “reddit” stuff instead of “googling” them?,"This is a very common tactic, especially when the top search results are just garbage optimized for the algorithm."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE automatically downvote ""promoted"" ads on Reddit?",[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE wish clothes had more half sizes, e.g. something between small and medium, medium and large, etc?","More accurately, I just wish the clothing industry had sizing standards."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find themselves getting emotional on internet comments, get halfway thru a reply and then suddenly realise that none of it matters?",All the fucking time
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a small pile of clothes set aside that were only worn for a couple of hours with intentions of wearing them again before washing?,"Absolutely.  In fact, it has occurred to me before that we don't even have a place for those clothes.  You don't want to put them back in the drawer or into the closet because they're not 100% clean, but they're also not dirty enough to throw into the laundry, so they end up on the floor or on a chair."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE close Reddit and open it again just seconds after closing it, because you simply have nothing better to do?",It's mostly because I DO have better things to do
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE ""check"" their vagina with their finger?","Yeah, to 'monitor' the situation down there. Normal. I'm paranoid about yeast/infection in general so I wash hands before and after if I do. I think you're normal but some people are just really private about even sharing this stuff. You're definitely not alone"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE (MALE) sit down when they pee?,"I only piss sitting down at home.   have done it for decades. 

I think smartphones have increased sit down peeing in men.   

Makes no sense peeing while standing up at home.  

In public you stand.  In homes you sit and relax."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE NOT give out to panhandlers because they can't tell how who's only pretending?,"At this point I’d rather give or donate to a woman’s shelter, etc, locally that I know is out on the streets giving bags of necessities and providing programs and such. I don’t often have extra cash in my own budget so when I’m able to give I want to make sure it’s going somewhere useful instead of to the groups around my town that have been identified to be scamming people by pretending to be “refugees”."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like their ability to speak and have conversations has deteriorated significantly over the past few years due to the pandemic?,"Yes I feel like I have no confidence in expressing my thoughts. If I do, I feel later like “why did I say that?” Or, when I see someone expressing their thoughts I think to myself, “why are they bothering to say that?” … my social skills have never been an issue in my entire life"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE still prefer paper books over e-books?,"I used to feel this way until I started having problems with my hands, holding books open. I got a kindle for Christmas and it has seriously helped me read faster and more often. I love it now."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like covid stole like 2 years of their life worth of growth and experience?,"A little bit. However it's still ongoing. I still operate my entire life from home. I work from home and take online classes. My past 2 girlfriends I've met on apps. Some of my friendships have faded, and it's been difficult to replenish my social circle. 

It's no longer Covid I guess. It's just that I'm living in a digital world."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have an outside cat that goes away for days on end, and wonder how many other families she whores herself out to besides yours?","We have cats that don't go out (on leash occasionally out back if they insist) because we're very near a major roadway. But we do have a couple of ferals who we feed and on rare occasions take to the vet to tend to their injuries. One of them disappeared for a while and now shows up with a collar, so we def know he has a home now. Another disappeared for 6 months (we assumed she'd been squished by a car) but just came back to the porch for kibs yesterday, she's looking kind of plump so pretty sure someone has tried to adopt her as well.

I'm tempted to start attaching notes to them to communicate with their new ""owners"" lol."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have to push their dick down when taking a shit so it doesn't touch the toilet?,Don’t forget to add when you don’t push it down correctly and start peeing and you piss through the toilet seat onto the floor.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE often feel relieved when their friends cancel plans, even if it’s last minute, because although you enjoy spending time with them, interacting with others makes you anxious and thus you prefer solitary time?","All the time, I wish I wasn't this way but unfortunately I am."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE miss lockdown,I’m a teacher. I miss the Mute All button. 😄😄
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find babies getting their ears pierced disturbing,"Claire's and places like it are THE WORST placed to get ears pierced and yes especially horrible for babies. The piercing guns they use cause tissue trauma and are far more painful than proper professional piercing.

 If your culture insists on piercing baby ears at least use the pediatrician or a professional piercer with properly sanitized equipment"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stay up at night because that’s the only time they can be alone?,Revenge Bedtime Procrastination is definitely a thing!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they could never get close to giving a sketch artist an accurate description of a person?,"I thought so, but the artist asks you the right questions. My dad was a cop and worked in identification (fingerprinting, etc.) As far as I know, he had no artistic ability whatsoever. He did have this box of facial features printed on cellophane sheets. To show me how it worked, he put together an exact likeness of a guy I was dating that he had never met by layering these cellophane sheets on top of each other. Even the boyfriend thought it was spot on when I showed him a copy of the ""sketch."" I don't know how he did it, but it was just asking questions. Took about 20 minutes.

Edit: to be fair though, this sketch was of someone I had spent a lot of time with. It would probably be much more difficult for someone you saw briefly during a high stress situation."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a strong averse reaction to musicals?,usually with musicals it feels like the musical part is filler (ik it isn't but it FEELS like filler) so i'm always just sitting there waiting for the song to be finished so the plot can go forward.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE believe that parents of extremely obese children are guilty of a kind of child abuse?,"Yeah, absolutely. We had a girl who came into my store (a vegan co-op) all the time. Morbidly obese, but able to walk with some difficulty. She would buy a ton of fruits, vegetables and hot foods like lentil soup and healthy whole-grain rolls. She’d sit and eat and wait for the disability shuttle to come pick her up. She said she used to bring the food home but her parents would make her toss it out, calling it “sticks and bark” cause it was all vegan.

A friend of mine, an old coworker, actually worked with the girl prior to that. Said she was happy to be around fast food again because her parents wouldn’t let her have any when they ordered out so she could “lose weight”. Just like at our store, after she’d get off work she’d order a ton of food and sit there eating until the disability shuttle came to pick her up. My friend speculated that it was her parents withholding food from her at home.

On top of that, the girl was sheltered and obviously emotionally scarred. She’d have a ton of questions to ask but would always apologize profusely - on the verge of tears - if she noticed someone getting annoyed. She also wanted to talk to everyone she could, perhaps out of loneliness. She only occasionally mentioned her family but wouldn’t want to dwell on it. I caught her more than once in tears calling her father begging him to pick her up because her shuttle didn’t arrive. Clearly an abusive home.

She did manage to lose weight, both by getting a place of her own through social services and eating food from our store. She seemed to know little about fruit and vegetables (eg., didn’t know how to prepare carrots for soup) but was eager to learn how to cook fresh food.

Sadly she passed away in her sleep recently. Only 26 years old."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find porn generally fake and unappealing and require a convincing onscreen mutual attraction and level of “realness” and believability to get aroused?,Yes I hate it. I can only get off to amateur or homemade porn. Over the top screaming and moaning is not my thing at all.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE write their 7s with a bar across the middle?,"Yes, and my Z’s"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else not make their bed after waking up?,"I remember reading somewhere that when you wake up, you’re supposed to pull back the sheets and open the curtains so that light and air can get to the sheets. Helps eliminate bacteria and dust mite growth. Not sure if this is true or not but I’ve been doing it for years since I read about it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE (NSFW) Have a porn video that they watched years ago and cant find no matter how hard they try?,I guarantee there is a sub somewhere on reddit where they will find it for you in 2 minutes flat
DoesAnybodyElse,Did anybody else as a child never think about what job they wanted?,I am an adult and I still don't know what I want.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have to shower in the mornings no matter what to feel clean?,"I sweat so much in my sleep, morning showers are the only way for me personally"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE take downvotes personally?,"Admittedly I did in the beginning, but after enough time on Reddit I realized that people will downvote you for virtually anything - even if it's a topic they're mildly discontent with.

It's only natural to seek the approval/validation of others, so I wouldn't beat yourself up over it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE actively not want to use a product if it’s advertised too much or forced down your throats?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE go through phases of obsessing over something for a few weeks and then dropping it?,"Yes, I am this way. It  can be tiring emotionally and financially."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else forget how old they are after 30?,"Yep!

Was actually surprised when my partner reminded me I was already 33 the other day. I was like no surely I'm barely even 31, did the math. Thirty bloody three! 

Lost track after the third kid I think."
DoesAnybodyElse,Dae find it odd when people say there trying for a baby?,"The thing that bothers me is when they say, ""she fell pregnant""."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE immediately scroll by as fast as you can whenever you come across a video that looks like it might show someone getting badly hurt or an animal being mistreated?,"Yes, or a post where someone posts a pic of their pet they just had put to sleep. It’s just too sad."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find themselves deleting a response to a post while typing because they’ve realized mid-sentence that they just don’t care enough to finish?,I just assume nobody cares about what I have to say
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it so exhausting to survive?,"You are not alone, buddy.


The current system is not kind to the poor."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like winning the lottery would be the only way out of their shitty live?,"Oh, all the damn time."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else sense a revolution coming?,"There won't be a revolution as long as electricity is plentiful, grocery stores are stocked and folks have cable (or internet) to distract them from reality in the evenings."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE never hear of Andrew Tate until he was arrested?,I really don’t know who he is still lol
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE gradually enjoy alone time more the older you get,Life beat the extrovert out of me.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think about embarrassing moments from the past and say something like ""stop stop stop"" to yourself while you're remembering it?","Omg yes.  I do this, except I think I say different things along the lines of ""no"" or ""uh uh"" .  I'll actually say it out loud if I'm by myself.  I don't talk to myself otherwise.

Sometimes I'll psychically shudder if I'm around other people when this happens.

This is definitely one of those things that I truly had no idea whether I was the only one who did this."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Have such vivid dreams that when you wake up you find yourself missing the relationships you had in them?,"I always have dreams of my parents, they’re both gone now. In my dreams, they’re always healthy. Both suffered a lot before they passed. It hurts but I kind of look at it like they’re still in contact with me. I wake up and face reality that they’re gone. It hurts but I’m glad I have great dreams at night with them."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel so guilty about procrastinating that they refuse to do anything you find fun, but still manage put off any work you have by moping around.","I call it guilt paralysis.
Because I usually just lay in bed on my phone endlessly scrolling."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE disassociate while driving and When you come back, you don’t even know how you got to that point?",Former truck driver here. Honestly surprised I'm still alive with the number of times this has happened.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE leave their clean laundry out for days at a time because you’re too lazy to put them away?,"Yeah I mean it's in a pile of cleanness. It's still clean, who cares"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get second hand embarrassment so bad themat they have to fast forward or leave the room when an embarrassing part of a show or movie happens?,"I used to all the time, it was a big thing for me. It was unspoken that I would just skip that stuff. Thankfully we can just fast forward. But now that I’m ok with it, my kids cant deal with it.

Here’s what I tell myself to get past a moment: this is a comedy actor performing comedy and doing their job. They practice to be this good and this is the goal.
  (That kind of stuff. I’m finally to a point where I can enjoy a lot of it. It is a type of humor after all, turns out)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE procrastinate getting out of bed to pee when you're awakened from sleep with an uncomfortably full bladder?,"too sleepy to piss, too full of piss to sleep"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE plan to die before they get elderly?,"I was diagnosed with prostate cancer at 51, I realized that I lived a great life, met and married the love of my life, and made peace with myself. I was prepared, but not ready to die. I just turned 65, have some health issues, would like to continue working another two years, but still not ready to go, although I am fully at peace if I should not wake up tomorrow.

My paternal grandfather passed at 49, my dad at 59. My maternal grandfather on the other hand, wasted away in a nursing home until he was 96, strapped in a recliner not knowing where he was or who was with him. I don’t want that for me. I always thought that when the time came, I’d go skydiving and not pull the ripcord! 🤣"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it extremely hard to find the right words to convey what you mean?,"So yeah this is basically the only obstacle I have left when it comes to my social anxiety. Like I'm confident enough to actually talk now and I'm not nearly as shy as I once was, but finding and putting together the words that I want to say that's just impossible for me."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Play games in Easy mode to actually enjoy them?,I almost always play on the easiest mode possible… hate combat… i also have chronic hand pain so i want to spam buttons as little as possible
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE talk to themselves?,"All the time when I'm home alone. ""well, I'd better make some lunch ey?"" ""Let's see what's on Netflix"" ""fuck me it's cold"" ""where did I leave [insert item here]"" etc. I'm always chatting away to myself. No reason for it, I've just always done it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE look at pictures of their younger selves and think how good-looking they were?,I look at old pics of myself and think I have no idea why I thought I was fat
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else feel like they waste their shower if you go poop right after ?,yea i always get so pissed cuz i feel dirty again
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wish we had to eat only once a week?,I wish eating was casual and not necessary for life. Just eating for pleasure would be my ideal.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get super paranoid when they turn on the garbage disposal that they’re suddenly going to lose control of their body and stick their hand in the disposal?,"I've decided these sorts of flashes are my brain's way of saying ""Hey do NOT do this!!"" in the only language it has."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think making fun of fat people at the gym makes no sense?,Do adults do that?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like oatmeal raisin cookies?,"Always what I reach for when given the choice. I've had a lot of bad chocolate chip cookies, but I've never had a bad oatmeal raisin cookie."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE - Does anyone else feel like since COVID their life has fallen apart?,"I was a ""patient zero"" COVID case.  They had me on so many antibiotics it pushed me into kidney failure.   My life literally has fallen apart.  Now I'm on dialysis, and I'm alone with no significant life partner and few prospects.  I feel like I'm just going through the motions of ""life"" until I die.."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think the world oversexualize everything?,Everything that can have huge profits gets overdone - sex - booze - war - food - drugs.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get offended when police say ""we took it really serious because it's one of ours"" when talking about an injured or killed police officer as opposed to a regular citizen?","I'm not sure if 'offend' is the right word. I don't like it. It's just another example of how police are valued above the rest of us. I'm not saying that people should be free to assault police officers. That would be ridiculous. However, I don't think police are 'more' important than other citizens. 

I was upset when a parade and several charity events earned over $1 million for the families of 2 police officers that died in a car accident 2 years ago. Charity events started within days of the accident. They even hosted an event here even though its an hour and a half drive to the city that employed those officers and no one here even knew their names. Both widows also received surivors' benefits. I'm sure they'd rather have their husbands alive and healthy, and I don't want families of police officers to lose anything. I want to see other bereaved families get the same concern and consideration instead of putting police officers above the rest of us. I've seen so many families left destitute after losing a husband and father, and they usually don't get any help aside from life insurance (if they had any)."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE vocalize when they remember something embarrassing?,"Oh hell yes. And when I am alone, I will stand up and literally _change the subject out loud._"
DoesAnybodyElse,"Has anybody else noticed that their reddit ""recap"" is incorrect?","Yeah, mine says I spent enough time here to go to the moon 36 times. How long does it take to go to the moon again?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they think clearly but not speak clearly?,Happens to me in therapy when I want to talk about things that happened in the past. I can perfectly vocalize it in my head but can’t say it out loud. I get it
DoesAnybodyElse,"HAE gotten to the point that they’re just sort of surviving day to day, and the grand aspirations they had in the past have sort of fallen by the wayside?",Is this not what life is for everyone?😓
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE refuse to watch a TV Show / Film simply because a certain actor is in it?,J-lo. She’s always the suffering underdog. Same story every time.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it disturbing and embarrassing how many people believe in astrology?,username does not check out
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just sit in their car when they get home from work because they’re just too tired to take off their seatbelt and go into their home?,"Look, all I want is 2 mins peace and quiet before I have to deal with the kids, OK?"
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else prefer to sleep in a cold room, but still under the blankets?","Yep, with one foot sticking out."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE take off multiple articles of clothing when they know they’re about to take an intense shit?,"LMAO my bf does this!! I've never known anybody else in my life to do it. But he literally strips all the way down, and puts a fan on and everything...lmao.

Edit:I'm laughing bc I was just talking to about this a few days ago and was wondering if others did it. Since I've never known anyone but him to do that"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not feel comfortable eating baked goods or food from people you barely know like a coworker or non family member?,Had a coworker who never washed her hands in the restroom try to give me one of her homemade cupcakes. I just pretend now and throw it away.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like to wear the same three things (clean of course) and eat the same kinds of food over and over?,*ASD has entered the chat*
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get pissed off at reviews that say they haven’t used the product they purchased yet?,"So annoying. I think it’s because Amazon sometimes pings you got a review pretty quickly and some people (probably older folks) don’t understand that you should just ignore the review solicitation if you haven’t tried it yet. What drives me even more crazy are people who answer “I don’t know” in the Q&A, because Amazon emails out those questions too, to other people who’ve purchased the product. Make it stop!!!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think the estates of the billionaires in the sub should reimburse the government for the search and rescue and potential recovery?,No. The company should. They ignored every warning that various entities gave them that the sub did not meet safety standards.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel awkward and weird eating when tradespeople are working on their house?,I totally get this. So awkward and if possible I avoid food preparation while they’re there.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have reverse SAD: feeling happy and blissful when it's cold and gray outside, but angry and irritable when it's hot and sunny?","

Yup, same here! I'm a total winter-lover and can't stand hot, sunny days. Especially when I'm stuck inside because of the heat and can't cool down. Nothing makes me feel better than a cold, gray day."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they're just prepared to cease all contact with like 95% of everyone they know?,Yes like everyone is nice and nothing is that bad i just feel like i want to runaway and i probably will
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the future just looks horrible?,Absolutely. Adding to your list: how the people in power keep finding ways to spread hatred and division among the people to keep themselves in power.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find that the people who say things like “only god can judge me” and call themselves “child of god” end up being the worst kind of people?,When I hear “only god can judge me” I like to reply with “yet here I am”
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think reaction videos are one of the worst trends on the internet?,I feel like it’s mainly people who are lonely or who don’t have anyone close to them that shares an interest in the content being reacted to. They like a certain style of music that many people their age don’t; they see a pretty girl close to their age “reacting” to a music video they love…bam they feel a connection to this reactor even if it’s virtual.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE when they notice someone's typo, look at their keyboard to see if the wrong letter is near the correct letter?","DAE get stuck for a second when they try to read ""DAE when they notice..""?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get the overwhelming urge to bother your pet?,"My cat and I are totally out of synch, he wants me to pet him while I sleep, I want to pet him while he sleeps"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wish people wouldn’t speak just to fill the silence?,I love silence and hate when people interrupt mine because they just can’t stop from talking.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stop going to a certain place because theres an employee who’s always there and always talks to you?,"Not quite the same, but if someone comments on how frequently I come in or that I'm becoming a regular, I immediately have to find another place to go."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that 1990-2007 was the perfect time,"In this period, technology was there, but it wasn't omnipresent. This might be a reason some of us get this feeling."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel irreparably mentally damaged after lockdown?,"this is quite literally exactly how i feel. starting therapy this wednesday, wish me luck!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stay up way later than you should because as soon as you go to bed tomorrow is here?,Revenge bedtime procrastination! It's a bitch.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not watch the oscars or any other awards event?,I don't. I don't really care about watching rich people spending lots of money to party while the rest of us are struggling to buy groceries.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like life has been on fast forward since 2020?,It's like time drags but days fly by.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get to places stupidly early because they are worried about being even a second late?,Afternoon appointment? Litterally can't do anything all morning.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE suddenly low key swallow their own spit wrong and almost choke to death?,"All the time! The best ones are when you're in a public space and everyone is trying to listen to someone speak, and you just suddenly start dying. The cough is impossible to suppress as well"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a harder time falling asleep knowing they have to be up early?,It’s called Anxiety lol
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wish people would spell it out instead of trying to turn everything into a damn acronym?,"I really appreciate how the American Psychological Association (APA) style handles this. When first mentioning an acronym in your body of work -- an article, a paragraph, a report, whatever -- you use each full word, followed by the acronym in parenthesis (like seen above). Once this is finished, you can then stick to using the acronym for the rest of the work. I think other styles use similar means to handle acronyms. 

OP, I am with you, this is also a huge pet peeve of mine. I don't like it when others expect you to know an acronym. It comes off as a weird flex in that they are trying to project some kind of expertise with the subject matter."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE constantly leave their tea/coffee to cool down then forget it until it’s far too cold?,Every. Single. Day.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE just not care about the life of any celebrities, actors/influencers/models/singers.","I'm the opposite. I will see drama about celebrities/influencers/content creators that I didn't even know existed and then go down a rabbit hole of reading about their drama. It's not even that I CARE about it, it's just a combo of mild curiosity and my ADHD tendency to exhaustively research any random thing to distract me from all the stuff I should actually be doing."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE put sour cream in their chili?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel politicians focus too much on addressing the symptoms of public issues (economy, gun violence, etc.) instead of the root causes?","Yes. 
They also tend to politicize issues that don’t need to be politicized."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel they’ve had to become selfish in order to survive in a world full of selfish people?,"Absolutely.  I fèl that when I'm nice, people see it as a weakness. I like to think that I'm an easy going and accommodating chap but feel that instead of thinking ""he's nice/I won't take the piss"" people think ""oh, he's easy to walk over ""."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get irritated at people who are really heavy-footed or loud talkers?,Yes. And it seems like every 6 year old is both of these things.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever hear their alarm go off in the morning and immediately start rationalizing quitting your job or dropping out of school in order to stay in bed?,Yes. I have chronic illnesses but I have a family to support so I get up and go. I’ve definitely had that conversation a million times. It was much worse when I was at an extremely toxic workplace though. Maybe your job sucks and you need to start looking for another one?!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE hit the add 30 seconds button on their microwave a bunch of times instead of putting the exact time?,"Only up to 90 seconds, so 3 times is my limit. Anything 2 min & up, I'm typing it in."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE rearrange pepperonis on frozen pizzas?,"Yeah, for sure, sometimes they all slide to one side or the machine that put them on was having a bad day."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sometimes open google maps just to zoom in and out and look at different parts of the map?,"When I was working, I used to take ""field trips"" on Google Maps during slow times. I'd be all over the place on Maps just exploring different areas on street view."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE accidentally make a weird noise when they remember something embarrassing?,yes plus vehemently shake my head involuntarily. thus creating another embarrassing event
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like the gender that were born with but don't like the social expectations around it?,"Yep. I’m perfectly comfortable being a woman, but I don’t love all the societal attachments to what being a woman is. I think many people feel this way about gender. I wish, as a society, we were able to view gender with more neutrality and not need to associate so many “rules” with it."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else not get the obsession many people have around sports?,"It's unscripted reality TV with a defined winner/loser



Also, people like gambling"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that, from a certain age, elderly people should be tested to see if it's still safe for them to drive?",Honestly I think that all drivers should be tested like once every 10 years or so.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the internet kind of sucks now?,Same here. Your post kinda makes me feel bad for reinstalling Reddit on my phone. Plus I now stay away from the news and fandoms of any sort. It often feels like my feelings were not really within my control and other people were playing with and determining how I felt.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel sick or discomfort when visiting their hometown?,"That may be normal if you didn’t have good experiences there. Look where you are now vs who you were as a person back then. For me, my hometown is a small farm community stuck in the 1970s. My partner grew up in a mining town and the place is absolutely falling apart. We both hate going back. Too bad family lives there."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think it's strange when people don't close their curtains at night, and you drive by and can see into their house?","I’ve always hated this, mostly because I grew up in a rough neighbourhood and having your windows open was a no-no because you were basically advertising what you had that was worth stealing. Open windows at night was (and still is) a sign of being in a good neighbourhood in my city. 

The problem today is that people seem to have no problem whatsoever with recording and posting online anything they see. I always get freaked out that someone could be recording me and my family inside our house or something. Yeah, I probably sound paranoid, but I just really like my privacy."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE watch their pet sleeping just to make sure they're still breathing?,I have done this to not only animals but anyone I’ve had fall asleep around me
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wipe their ass even when you're not taking a dump?,"My best friend told me he has never once in his life washed his ass in the shower. He said ""I don't even go back there""

I was mystified. I couldn't understand what he meant. But now I know. He literally has never splashed some water and body wash back there with some hot water. I imagine d he has a thick fur blanket of shit cake and hair decades old. His poor girlfriend. Ugh. He's rich though! Trust fund"
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else truly, truly wish they could erase their entire existence and start all over again?","yes, but i want a complete reset, like from birth."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE look at old photos that you used to think you looked bad in, and think “wow I actually looked good back then!”?",I try to use this as “proof” that I should be more confident in the present
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else alwayys have to dig the box out of the trash for the cooking time when baking something?,All the time! Even if I've already looked at it before throwing it away.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they are never 100% themselves around other people and it's absolutely draining?,"Yes I feel the same way. My bf is the only person I don't get drained spending time with, although I also need some alone time of course. Sometimes I wonder why do I even bother trying to find friends or even people to hang out with because at the end of the day I get nothing out of it really. It's bad enough that I have to socialise at work every damn day for 8hr+, the rest of my time I just wanna isolate myself."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like people are becoming worse drivers?,People are becoming worse.* Period.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE run their toothbrush twice under the faucet?,Lmao. One to make the brush cleaner. The second to add a bit of wetness to the paste. 🤷🏽😂
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE secretly love the smell of gasoline, even though they know it's not good for them?",Definitely. I'm not intentionally inhaling it but when I'm at the pump it's definitely nice to get a big ol' whiff!
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE write down their favourite quotes? I would love to hear yours. I’ll start “ Truth does not mind being questioned, a lie does not like being challenged”.","“And now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good.” - John Steinbeck"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE immediately disregard very long posts, those that are just a wall of words, or anything that starts with “sorry, long post”?",Only if there's no punctuation or line breaks.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it annoying how shitty most mobile sites are and not want an app for every service/business you use?,"Honestly if the site doesn’t work well, I shop elsewhere lol"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Wish They Could Make Their Screen Dimmer Than The Lowest Setting?,"I use an app called Twilight, have been for years, it's 5/5 for me, total lifesaver for my sensitive eyes"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE’s Reddit account keep getting followed by spammy NSFW bot accounts that exist only to advertise Only Fans pages?,"That's pretty much the only use of the ""following"" system: enabling bot spam. I believe you can disable the option for allowing followers in your settings."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE believe Elon is purposely destroying Twitter or does he have another master plan?,"Hanlon's razor: ""never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."""
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think Jimmy Kimmel isn’t funny? Seems like he only wants to put people down.,"I lost all respect for Kimmel when he showed that clip of Joaquin Phoenix getting upset with someone on the production team while filming for Joker, without telling Phoenix that he was going to do it, putting him in a really uncomfortable position by asking him what happened live. Phoenix is clearly uncomfortable because it was just a heated moment on set and it paints him as a huge asshole without any context."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find using the same utensil in both the PB jar and the Jelly jar to be gross and unsanitary when making PBJ’s?,"I was always taught to do Jelly first then wipe the knife on the clean bread before getting peanut butter. It can be an allergy issue for guests if you cross contaminate the Jelly. 

Both of my kids somehow ended up with peanut allergies so we're very careful about this kind of thing."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have no desire to get a job?,"I have a job but I have no desire to work, I do it for the money."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE cry when extremely mad and overwhelmed even when you don’t want to be crying?,"I do and I hate it! I want to get my words out but nope, throat tightens I get all choked up nothing comes out but the tears."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they come off as rude when in reality you’re just socially awkward?,"Yep.  I tend to avoid eye contact and say very little.. especially if I’m anxious.  And the natural flow of conversation isn’t my strong suit.  So I’m sure I seem disinterested or short with people.  Since I deal with this too, I don’t have a lot of advice to give.  My go-to has been smiling when spoken to/introduced and keeping my face looking as inviting as possible.  I also pay attention to my body language because I tend to have closed off body language.  Once I’ve done that, I might comment on the decor or location. And when someone talks or tells a story, I nod, smile and say “oh man” when appropriate.  Then if all else fails and I’m awkwardly next to someone in the group that I don’t know, I’ll ask “What’s the craziest thing you’ve ever seen (or done)?”  You can create all sorts of questions this way, “what’s the ______ thing you’ve ever _____?” Or ask someone what their favorite drink is. 

That’s all I’ve got.  Just try to relate when possible and look open and inviting.  If nothing else you might come off as quiet or shy but not rude."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have some right leaning views and find it annoying that the right has been hijacked by these morons?,"I think there is plenty of people with mixed views but they exist in real life, not on the Internet where every opinion has to be an extreme."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE ""pretend"" teach a nonexistent person how to do something when you are doing it, because it makes it easier to follow the process?","This is called ""rubber-ducking"" and is a useful technique for mindfulness and reëxamining implicit decisions."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find the origin of things interesting?,"It's definitely not only you! What particularly interests me is the dawn of civilization, how we went from nomads to being able to farm, thus making it unnecessary to keep migrating"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE still make stupid jokes to themselves even when they’re alone?,"Yes, I do. Your joke made me laugh, too."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find TikTok, Insta Reels and YouTube Shorts unwatchable?","The insta reels are the worst. You can't pause, skip or restart the thing you're watching. So annoying."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get tired of seeing social media influencers promoting sex toys?,"My first thought was “who promotes that?”

Then I realized I follow no influencers"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think M&Ms are better in a supporting role like in trail mix or ice cream sandwiches than they are as a stand-alone candy?,"Yes. Except for peanut m&ms, I could eat those by the pound lmao."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE fear their life will go too fast?,Nobody prepares you for how strange the timeline of your life will feel. It’s flying past your eyes at 100mph and simultaneously is the longest amount of time you’ll ever experience.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find taking dumps extremely satisfying, feeling an afterglow for a solid 30 minutes after dropping a deuce?","If its solid, yes. If its wet but not the runs then no."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Feel like the purpose of life is to do all you can to distract yourself from the fact that nothing matters?,I fully embrace the meaningless of life.  Just have fun.  It’s really just a ride to enjoy until it ends.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE eat their fast food in the car because they don’t want to bring it inside and share with anyone else?,I eat it in the car so I can cry and no one will see me.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else suddenly vibrate for second while sleeping ?,"Yes, this and that falling off the fictitious ledge"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE turn their Bluetooth off on the phone before watching porn, just to be safe?",It’s the only safe way to fly.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the more you expect something the less likely it will happen?,"Yes, because you're fixating on it, the more significant it seems when it doesn't occur."
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else find most parts of life monotonous, and repetitive?",Yep. Every day I just look forward to clocking out and then I'm back before I know it. At least when I was in school there was this sense of optimistic wonder and I had friends to talk to. Now I'm lucky to have one genuine daily interaction at work.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE lay in bed on their phone for at least an hour before sleeping each night?,"Yup, most of my friends do too. It's a common bad habit amongst our generation"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find it irritating how oblivious people are to their surroundings in public places, often standing directly in your way or turning right into you as if they have no peripheral vision?","If you are blocking the Isle in a shop walking next to each other and walking at snail pace there is a special kind of hell for you.

The rage. The uncontrollable rage."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else prefer words and pictures over video when researching how to do something?,"Yes!!!! Sometimes, I won’t use the help if I can’t find it in words and pictures!!!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just not. want. kids.,"I have kids. But it's not for everyone. You may change your mind. You may not.

I have a lot of respect for people who know they don't want kids and make the decision to be childfree. It's a hell of a lot better than stumbling into parenthood because you think you're supposed to."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE hold their breath when someone gets too close so you don’t breathe in that other person’s breath?,"I hold my breath because I don't want to breathe in their breath, or have them smell my breath. Also, in general, I do NOT like being that close to someone, anyway."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else have an opposite-gender best friend who has a nonsexual relationship containing overtly sexually explicit conversations?,">we talked about masturbation for an hour 

So like Phone Sex Lite, except no one’s horny at the end? Y’all are definitely *non traditional* for sure."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE who grew up low income splurge on the things they couldn’t have as a kid?,"Hell yea I do. I'll work overtime just to buy a toy I wanted as a child, just to sit on my desk.  I've actually been contemplating buying the og Bionicle sets."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE know what Bread Pudding is??? Everybody I talk to about this acts like I’m crazy and they have no idea what I’m talking about,I love bread pudding. My first experience was working in a 5 star restaurant as a water girl. They made bread pudding with the leftover brioche.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE prefer to completely ignore all news and just live a quiet and happily ignorant life?,"Definitely hearing less and less news, used to only hear news on the car radio, podcasts have overtaken live radio, used to also see some news on Facebook, hardly ever look at that now, I'm quite happy in ignorance of the news."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they're too stupid to ever get their life together?,"You guys, come on. Cut yourself some slack. Some of us started adulthood with broken foundations. It’s really hard to build on something that’s crumbling.

Make the best decisions you can at the time, and try to leave the world a little better place when you leave. No need to beat yourself up; life’s already got that covered."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does Anybody Else find that advertisements for products actually make you NOT want to buy them?,"Omg yes I have thought about this too!! Yeah the ads go to great lengths to make the product look good with lighting, colors, happy people, and talking about it in a way that makes you think need it. It's like, if I need your thing I'll decide for myself.

Just show evidence that your product successfully accomplished what it was supposed to. Playing it up with external factors feels like they're trying to trick us into thinking we need something we don't."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it’s a major red flag when somebody describes themselves as a “free thinker”?,My dad claims himself as a free thinker but he doesn't like it when others can think for themselves.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel kind of ""frozen"" at the age they were when the pandemic hit?","I feel this too. I was 28 in 2020, so 31 now, still feel like I should be about to turn 30. 

But on the other hand the stages of development of one's early 20s are behind me so there's not much difference, and older people (maybe 50+) have told me they still feel like they're in their late 20s, so maybe I'll never *feel* older than I do now anyway.

It's seemed to have had a bigger impact on people who were still in school; my youngest brother was in high school, and although he's a freshman in college now, he still seems like a high schooler socially."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have the urge to just delete als social media?,Do it. I've had periods were I get rid of everything. Longest I went was a year during the pandemic. It was great actually.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE after writing an entire Reddit comment, asks himself, ""Why the hell am I fighting with this random person on the internet?"" then simply remove the entire comment?","Right here. By the time I hit the second or third paragraph, I just feel like an absolute loser for putting so much effort into it. Why does it even matter? No one's going to change anyone's mind on this site, so the only possible outcome is a downvote war."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE spread their butt cheeks before sitting down to poo?,"No. I squeeze them together using the seat to really add pressure in an ongoing attempt to create flat shits instead of croissant-shaped shits but I just can't nail down that ""pasta roller"" consistency I'm looking for."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE lose their appetite if they cooked a meal themselves?,"Yes. But like, I don’t lose my appetite. I’m still hungry but not for what I just made."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE risking their job,career and future to get extra 5 minutes of sleep","As someone doing WFH, I always wake up at 9:00 when I start my shift, not a minute earlier to prepare."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE deliberately sleep as much as possible because they find their dreams much more enjoyable than reality?,I think they call that depression
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE go to the toilet at school or work just to take a little mental break?,"yes, me right now"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Feel Like They HAVE to Watch Something While Eating?,"It has been me, myself and I, for 21yrs come April.  All three of us watch TV during meals, it’s company."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want another quarantine?,"No, just time off"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want to go home?,When I was my most depressed I cried constantly for home despite being an adult and being at my home. It is almost a grief like ache for something.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE listen to both cute songs and rock/heavy metal?,"There are good songs and artists in all types of music. 
And from all over the world."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a plan for their adult toy stash if they die unexpectedly?,"I cleaned out the home of my grandmother with dementia when she was placed in a nursing home. 

I assure you, there's much worse things to find than things related to completely natural, human actions."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE put off watching the last episode of a series because they don’t want the series to end?,"Yes, i find myself doing this repeatedly."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel uncomfortable when parents kiss their kids (especially older kids) on the lips?,"Me and my sister used to always kiss my grandmother goodbye on the lips for a while it was just kinda the done thing. Weird how it was only my maternal grandma and no other grand parents. But I can remember vividly that one time I did it and our lips actually locked whereas all the times before it was like lips directly flat onto each other. It instantly felt weird when it happened like it felt like I kiss kissed my Nan. Haha needless to say it was always a cheek kiss and hug after that. 
TLDR - my grandmother was my first real kiss….. 😩"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ffwd through sex scenes in movies? even when you're by yourself?,"Yeah, but not because of prudishness, but because they're boring af."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE despise the over the top dialogue you often hear in teen movies and romantic comedies that sounds way too “quick” and prepared, and nothing like young people talk in real life?","I know exactly what you mean. For some time I thought I was really dumb, but then I realised it is not me, it is them.

Realistic dialogue is difficult to write though. But I do wish the writers would start to think about what is reasonable and what not."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sound out Wed-Nes-Day when typing it so you spell it correctly?,Yes. I mentally picture a wedding and a Nintendo. It's Wed/NES day.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE drive the speed limit, basically all the time?","Insurance Agent here…an insurance company offered me to use their driving tracker to try it out (meant for a company with a fleet of vehicles to track their employees, not for consumer).  Anyway, tried to drive the speed limit for a week to get a perfect score.   I literally thought I was gonna die. I was tailgated mercilessly everywhere I went and people passed me on dangerous roads etc.  I didn’t make it 2 days, went back to my normal driving (not a big speeder but I go with the flow).  At least where I live, driving the speed limit is dangerous."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like sex is a chore?,"I think another thing that plays into that feeling, beside the stuff other comments mentioned, is different libido levels in relationships. It’s very difficult to find a healthy balance if the individuals in a relationship have different sexual needs. It’s important to make sure the lower drive partner doesn’t feel forced, pressured or obliged, while the higher drive partner shouldn’t feel disregarded either. Even if there’s zero pressure from your partner, there’s still that unsettling feeling of not giving them what they need or deserve or whatever and we push ourselves to accommodate which can certainly feel like a chore."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find they can't feel refreshed on the weekend unless they do absolutely nothing?,"Yep 100%

I only get Sundays off and I spend the whole day catching up on chores, by the time I’m done and ready to relax it’s time to make dinner. Guaranteed to feel shit every single Monday."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE ever think about sleeping with a weapon close by, just in case?",I'm a single woman living in a sketchy neighborhood and my landlord refuses to replace my paper thin front door. I keep pepper spray within reach. A toddler could kick down my door.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have the constant need for noises?,"As I have come to understand from my wife's recent foray into the mental health diagnosis realm, this can be indicative of things like like ADHD and other sensory-based things"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have extremely vivid dreams of escaping horrific scenarios?,this but except I don't survive.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think people who vape recreationally and were not previously addicted to nicotine are peak cringe and it should be illegal indoors?,"I don’t really think it matters how someone starts. It’s the same as somebody who smokes cigarettes. Once you’re addicted, you’re addicted and it’s going to be difficult for anyone to quit regardless of the reason why they started.
For the second part, I don’t think any business wants someone vaping inside. At least not where I live. It’s hard to moderate though since after a couple seconds the vapor is gone and it might be difficult to prove that someone was vaping indoors."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Think phones have peaked?,"by now the cell phone is pretty much locked down as to size, shape, design, features. the only real advance i see is in refinements. better, faster, clearer, brighter and in the software. 

the next big thing will probably be when we no longer have to hold the phone. however that will take a few advancements before they can pull that off."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like it’s unfair how much climate change gets put on our plate as regular people instead of giant corporations?,It’s not an accident. The big companies want you to feel good about yourself for buying a plastic bottle with 30% less plastic while they push more carbon into the air in a day than you could in 100 lifetimes.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE perpetually smell the inside of cups before drinking out of them?,DEFINITELY. I'm not going to drink from a cup that smells stale or cabinet-y.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like we never actually grow up, we're just kids with jobs and bank accounts?","If it makes you feel better, I will completely own the fact that I spend ~82% of my life on survival mode, and the rest on either cleanup or “planning”. I have had almost no game plan just going from disaster to disaster. I (and my husband) have said frequently, fuck being grownup.

I have come to the conclusion being an adult merely means accepting you don’t know what the hell to do but you’ll take a shot and if it doesn’t work then you’ll try something else. All of this is accomplished while *exhausted*, usually with random pain, and accepting that everything sucks. So you just make the best of it. Everybody’s got their own disaster and coping mechanisms. In my case (also 40s), caffeine and comfy clothes required.

Trust me homie, you are doing bout the same as everyone else."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get tired of bouncing hours when entering and leaving daylight savings time?,It’s like jet lag without getting to go anywhere:(
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get guilt tripped when they don't go to bed at the same time as thier significant other?,Is she a bad sleeper? Some people wouldn't feel peaceful enough to sleep if they knew they would be woken up later by you walking in
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think porn search engines (Pornhub) is practically usless?,"Just because I search for MILF doesn't mean I want to see someone fuck their own mother.  Pornhub disagrees.

My theory is that every video on there is loaded up with tags that barely have anything to do with the actual videos so certain videos will show up almost regardless of what you search for."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like life is just a series of obligations,Live your best life by minimizing the amount of obligations ;)
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the car company Tesla has ruined the name of the inventor Tesla?,Fun fact: if you steal a Tesla it becomes an Edison

A blue line along the gum, with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as burton line,
High blood pressure,
Declines in mental functioning,
Memory loss,
Mood disorders,
Reduced sperm count, abnormal sperm,
Miscarriage or premature birth in pregnant women


My dad worked on cars all his life. He now suffers from headaches, mood disorders, and severe depression. He can't really get out of bed anymore without becoming overwhelmed and dizzy. He has been to countless doctors and tried countless meds. So very had to watch. The thought of lead poisoning from leaded gasoline has definitely crossed my mind."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else secretly wish the world would come to an end? So we could live our lives in a post apocalyptic wasteland. Where the only thing that matters is survival of the fittest?,"No, fuck no. I like running water and shit man"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it weird that ppl still give a shit about monarchs in this century?,"The whole idea of it is odd to me. A few hundred years ago, I get it, but today they're just property owners who also receive welfare because no one knows how to stop the tradition."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find people who refuse to adapt to modern technology irritating?,"> They want receipts for every inconsequential transaction

If I am picking up something for work and I need to get reimbursed for it I do not consider that inconsequential.  Accounting requires a receipt."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that a large portion of posts on AITA are fake?,Sometimes I think in aita people will try to make themselves seen like better people or victims which make the posts seem more fake.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not like being spoken to first thing in the morning.,"When I was younger the rule was not to talk to me until I'd had my first cigarette.

Now that I don't smoke anymore, it's pretty much, just, don't talk to me."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else feel like we should actually new create a car free city,"there is many communities doing this already in the US. in Utah alone we have 4 or 5 in development now. they aren't car free but they are planned for the people that live there to not need a car unless they need to travel to work or out of the area. there is Lakes ( small paddleboard, fishing lakes ) entertainment, bars, urgent care, grocery stores, ect... all in a small footprint. 

problem is, no one has a yard per se ( very small if they do ) and the housing is smallish and cramped. great idea though to provide a less income draining way of living."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get tired of initiating sex with their wives?,This is probably something you should talk about with her
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE intentionally avoid their neighbours so they don't have to engage in pointless small talk about weather and so on?,[removed]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE notice that when men take a shit it lasts like half an hour?,I'm reading this while pooping. It's been 14 minutes already.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE just wake up, plan the day inside their heads, get up to pee, go back to bed and just become stuck in their bed all day because they just got completely immersed on on the Internet?",I don't like being called out like this.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE fall asleep better when they think about sexual thoughts?,"100% odd, you'd think it would keep you awake, but nothing helps me fall asleep faster."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think the mental health crisis is more important than the drug crisis?,"Tbh, I think they‘re much more connected than one might notice on the surface :/"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE plan escape routes at the movies and restaurant in case things go south?,I’ve got this thing for always sitting where I can see the entrance of the restaurant or facing the opening to the room when I’m out in public and my gf asked me about it once early on in the relationship. It was a little embarrassing to admit out loud but I told her it may be that I could be paranoid lol I just feel safer when I can see what’s going on at the entrances
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE devolve every time they eat popcorn?,"No... Not just you. Popcorn is addictive as hell haha. Im the same.

Everytime we order it at the pub, one bowl turns into 4 as we all ravage it!"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else not give a fuck about christmas?,I can’t get anyone a gift this year. Poorer than poor. I hate it.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE desperately want to rewind their whole life and start again because of all the bad choices that lead you to the mess you’re in now?,"Here’s the question. Do you get to keep the knowledge you have gained to this point to use to your advantage? If not, what is the probability of making the same bad choices and ending up right back in the same position you’re in now?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel genuinely tired when being advertised to?,I feel like the bombardment of buzzwords and empty promises can be quite exhausting - I can sympathize.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel more productive when you are alone and so inefficient with other people?,"Yes I have ADHD and I can't concentrate with people looking or waiting on me. Leave me alone and I'll get it done, but I just can't maintain a single train of thought around people."
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE ever come to the realization they never had any good friends?,"Yep, actually this has been hanging on my mind today. Looking back at past conversations, and realising that no-one starts a conversation with me. It's always been me to start otherwise nothing happens. 

Makes you feel incredibly lonely that the friends you think you have don't put in any effort to talk to you."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sit on the shower floor and zone out for 30+ minutes?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like talking with people is way too complicated?,"""What do you do for work?"" Oh Jesus fuck shoot me."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get so anxious about the stuff you need to get done in your day that you end up just wallowing in a cesspit of procrastination as your anxiety continues to grow while you sit there doing nothing, rather than just getting up and doing it?",Yep. And usually they’re things that take less than 10 min to complete but cause a days worth of stress not doing them
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE set their clocks in their home a few minutes fast so they aren't late to things?,"Nah cause then I know I set them fast and now I know I can wait longer. Endless cycle, I need someone to set them fast but never tell me."
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE stopped reaching out to people because it seems like you’re the only person putting effort into friendships and feel more and more like a burden when people don’t respond.,Yup....I stopped and now I don't have a relationship with anyone outside of my house because no one returned my efforts.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel really really ashamed and gross after masturbating?,"No, unless when my head clears I see that the cat has been watching me.  And then I'm embarrassed, and I wonder if she knows what I was doing (probably does, but she hasn't winked at me so I figure she's ok with it.)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it hard to not feel like a douche while walking into an establishment taking your sunglasses off?,"I personally like to walk in, pause, and whip my glasses off like I’m a damn action hero."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just really suck at drying off after a bath/shower?,"Maybe you need a better or more absorbent towel?

I usually run my hands over my body to wipe some water off before using a towel. This gets off a lot of water before it gets in my towel, so it helps get dryer faster."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have this urge to create but don't/can't create anything?,"Yes! I completely know how you feel. I get these moods where I’m OVERLY MOTIVATED to do something but when I draw it turns out bad, when I play music it doesn’t satisfy my needs, when I write nothing comes to mind, etc etc so I’m just sitting and stewing in this pit of empty motivation"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE eat the least pleasant part of the meal first while saving the more enjoyable parts for last?,I do this all the time...
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel overwhelming pressure to achieve something, but struggle with the lack of energy, motivation and reason to follow through?",I think most people feel this way during certain periods of their life. I find it’s easier to focus on what I should do in the immediate – like today. If I have a good day that leads to another good day and I usually end up in a good spot.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel so tired of everyone's insufferable cynicism of other people?,"I'm a friendly person, so people are usually friendly back. But as a female, sometimes they mistake friendly for interested, and that is where my mistrust comes from. I've read too much reddit!"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else go nuts if someone stops a microwave with time still on it and just leaves it that way so you can't see the clock or input your own timing??,"It's a r/mildlyinfuriating thing for me

I'm not gonna go out of my way to get into an altercation about it, but I'm gonna be annoyed by it every single time."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE as an adult, rewatch an old TV show you loved as a child/teenager, only to realize that it's not as good as you thought it was?",or... rewatching king of the hill and realizing how damn good it actually is
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think day-to-day eating is but another chore?,I always wish I could just photosynthesize.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that the up vote arrow should turn blue when clicked and the down vote arrow should turn red when clicked?,The red is Reddit's brand color. And means the post is hot vs cold.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE only enjoy using the little spoon when eating?,"Little spoons and forks or bust!! My boyfriend always gives me the large utensils with food and I’m like what am I, an ogre???"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have hairy nipples?,I get about 4 hairs that pop up around each one that I vigorously pluck every chance I get.  I now have a white hair that grows SUPER fast and is very thick and I'm so embarrassed by my hairs.  I know its normal I was a medic and worked in the ICU so I've seen my fair share of naked women but I still don't accept mine.
DoesAnybodyElse,"Has anybody else had a ""crush"" on someone against their own will?","Recaptcha: youre human, right?

Me: unfortunately, yes"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Feel Like “Your xyz Years Old” Is Un-supportive And Harmful?,"You’re not alone in this.

I remember being in my mid-teens, talking to my dad about something political and him dismissing me completely and refusing to listen because of my age, saying ‘you’ve done nothing, you’ve seen nothing, you know nothing’ and it’s stuck with me all this time."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they didn’t grow up correctly?,"You are describing a normal life tho.
By which I mean, you are not abnormal for feeling this way. I would say these are common feelings for most people today."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just suddenly think of things they've done in the past and have a panic attack about it ?,Daily
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE Does anyone else use reddit because they're lonely, or am I the only one who feels it be wierd to ask a stranger too hangout with me, in Vegas?","Your not alone in this, the popularity of meet up groups for people just looking for people with similar interests shows people are not connecting in meaningful ways in the physical world. Not weird there are also groups that do travel for people who are doing it solo but don't want to go solo."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE always say ""ouch"" whenever you crash with something even though it didn't hurt?","Yes, I do this."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get high and watch their pet play with a toy and get as fascinated by watching them as the pet gets by the toy?,"Bruh I don't need to get high for that, it's entertaining sober."

DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE love the feeling of falling asleep so much, that they don’t mind if they wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night because it means they get to fall asleep an extra time?","When I was younger, sometimes I’d purposely set my alarm on the weekends just so I could be happy that I didn’t have to get up and could appreciate sleeping more."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they’ve just been declining physically over the past few months?,"You’re not alone. I’m feeling weird too. However, we just got out of a worldwide pandemic that slowed many things to a halt and now life is speeding up again. 

Just recently I have begun to get lightheaded after getting out of bed. Every time. Now I have to stand still for about 30 seconds to gain my bearings or I’ll just fall. I just turned 40 so I can’t even blame age. It’s weird."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they have had pretty much one constant cold over the last few months?,"I have! One of my coworkers back in October caught some kind of virus from her granddaughter, brought it to the office, everyone there was sick for months. I've been perpetually sick since, I don't even remember what it was like to breathe normally at this point."

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find some voices really irritating?,I find my own voice irritating.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sometimes catch their thoughts drifting to nonsense as they're falling alsleep?,"Yes this is when I can tell I'm about to fall asleep, when my thoughts start getting stupid. Everything will make perfect sense in the moment, but then when I think back a few seconds later it's either forgotten or completely incomprehensible. 

It happens much more often when I'm falling asleep watching TV. I'll start to get really dumb thoughts about what was happening in the show or just completely lose track of anything that's happening. Occasionally I'll be keeping track with the dialoge and everything and then notice that the movie or show had actually been paused for like 20 minutes and I just imagined all of it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE smell like fart during and after and orgams?,The internet will never cease to surprise me
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else wake up in bed and have racing thoughts about the future and feeling helpless?

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE quickly grow to loathe the subreddit for their favorite shows/teams/games/etc because it just turns into a bunch of people shitting on the thing they're supposed to love?,"That, and when the gatekeepers show up"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get overwhelmed easily just from being surrounded by people?,Yep. I can't take large crowds for long periods of time. I can't take it even if I know everyone there like at family event or something. So much social interactions fucking drains the shit out of me.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they have no clue whether people like them or not?,I can’t read people at all.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else think miracle whip is absolutely disgusting?,I thought I hated mayo until I was 21. Then I had Hellman's and saw the error of my ways: I had unwittingly been gagging on Miracle Whip all my life!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE purposely bright another driver when they don’t turn theirs off on the opposite side while driving?,"The trick is to recognize that they have their brights on before they get so close that it’s bothersome and give them a quick flash with your high beams.

Generally speaking, you can tell if somebody has their highbeams on long before they get close enough for it to be a problem."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE sometimes ""unlock"" more pee when they've stopped peeing?","yes. i don't understand why that happens

EDIT: It's not pee stuck in the urethra; I know that's a thing but it isn't what OP is talking about.  It feels more like unlocking another bladder. You think you're almost done, and then a whole 'nother stream starts and it goes for another half-minute or more"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE keep some of your parents old voice mails just in case they die so you can always remember what their voice sounds like?,"Yes. I have one from my mom who passed away 10 years ago. It’s the only one I have and it’s hard to listen to, but I’m really glad I saved it. I save every single one from my Dad who is alive and well. I recently started screenshoting FaceTime calls with my dad so I have a visual record of how often we talk.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE fall in love with a tv show and then get really self consious when you watch it with other people because you suggested it?,this happens to me not just with tv shows but my interests in general tbh so maybe its fear of judgement?

DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else wear newly bought clothes without washing them first?,"I worked a few months in retail (one of these huge clothing stores) and smelled the clothes when they were just delivered and unpacked. So I just want to tell you : please wash your new clothes, for your own health.
They are covered in chemicals that can provoke really fucked up allergic reactions, rashes, and so on."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE never want to work ever?,"Yeah I dont think anyone wants to work. People who say they like to work like to feel productive, like theyre doing something for their community, have a routine, have power. 

I want to open my own bakery someday. Not so I can wake up at 4am and shovel the snow off my car and drive into work and bake and wash dishes, I want to do it so people can enjoy fresh bread, beautiful birthday cakes, pretty pastries with their coffee."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find the terms ""hubs"" or ""hubby"" cringey ?","""Hubster""

UUGGHHHHHH

But yeah I hate every iteration of Hubby."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE take off their “Outside clothes” and possibly shower before sitting on your own chairs or beds and stuff?,"Husband and I change into inside clothes as soon as we get home. No outside clothes on our bed, ever. We shower at night. I don’t like sleeping with the day stuck on me."
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else feel stressed and doomed when reading all those reddit posts like no jobs, no housing, no decent pay, no bright future?","Yeah, I left r/antiwork for that reason. 

You get to curate your feed with the subs you subscribe to and what you click on and upvote dictates the feed as well. Take a critical look at your subs and maybe thin out the ones that are kinda heavy and add some more lighthearted ones (there’s lots of cute cat subs or wildlife photography etc). Maybe find some hobby related subs too."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE go out of their way to be nice to fast food employees or waiters, since they have to deal with lots of rude customers?","Be nice to everyone, regardless. It’s really not that difficult."

Tbf tho I also have poor conversational skills"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel compelled to upvote posts with less than 100 reacts or comment on posts with zero comments because internet stranger might be sad no one cares.,"I like to scroll to the bottom of a thread and rescue all the perfectly reasonable comments that have been downvoted to 0 just because someone disagreed.

(I think it’s fine to upvote/downvote based on agreement when a comment has lots of upvotes, but we shouldn’t vote someone’s contribution down to zero or negative unless it’s blatantly incorrect or trollish.)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE often get a runny nose when eating even regularly hot food?,"If you mean hot as in spicy yes.
In fact I have terrible nasal allergies and instead of taking meds I will just keep a pack of spicy candy or eat peppers to clear up my sinuses."

DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE go to cross the street, but then you see a car coming, so you pretend that you WEREN'T trying to cross the street so the driver doesnt try to stop to let you cross?","I often do that too, but more because it always seems to come to that drawn out point of confusion of who’s giving way to who, and its just quicker and safer to make the car driver think youre not crossing so they hurry up and go already jeez"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE despise when people are careless or inconsiderate with spreading their illness?,"Until relatively recently (COVID) it was seen as strength of character to come into work when sick. Taking days off was seen as weakness.

I hate it too, but also bear in mind people often have limited sick days, and they're also not firing on all cylinders when ill, so they might be more careless than normal."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel content being unambitious going through life?,"Totally agree with you! As I get older it feels like I collect responsibility, sometimes I fantasise about just disappearing and living in solitude"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel there are too many bullies on Reddit?,"I find it more civilized here than Facebook.

Reddit has a lot of young people and kids can be cruel... But they should also be corrected for bad behavior."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Not Have Interest in Sex?,"For me it was me chasing affection and once we smashed and the sex was done i realized it wasnt more than a hollow fuck. I needed someone to reachout and care so id look for partners but it only made me feel more hollow inside. Moral of the story , fuck when you like , and get yourself in the right headspace and understand what your role is in every relationship you carry."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Consistently use “too much” toilet paper?,I installed a bidet.  Cuts down on paper usage and cleans better
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else not toast Poptarts?,I eat my pop tarts raw as nature intended

DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE that graduated from school still have dreams that they’re about to fail an important test and, even after waking up, lack the insight that it was only a dream and feel obligated to return to sleep solely to set things right in the dream (ie. study and not fail the test)",I've been out of school for 15 years and still have these dreams. I believe it relates to stress and/or feeling out of control.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else really not do well on a poor night's sleep?,"Yes, idk how so many people are functional"
DoesAnybodyElse,IAE one inconvenience away from a mental breakdown?,All the god damn time! I'm one minor inconvenience from raging 2007 Brittany Spears style.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find people who make ""self-help"" their whole personality so obnoxious?","I tend to find these people run on toxic positivity a lot of the time, which I also find obnoxious. Life suck sometimes, and it’s okay to be sad sometimes. You’re not a bad person or weak because you can’t find the silver lining in every single thing that happens to you."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else think that this is the beginning of the end for Twitter?,"I do, as someone who's used twitter fairly regularly for the past 2 and a half years, I won't mind if it goes under. Granted, another platform will surely take the same concept, as TikTok did to Vine, but Twitter's moderation has always been horrible so hopefully whatever comes next will be better."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like anyone can do the job you do even without a degree?,"Yes, as someone with a uni degree myself, but I'm currently trying to accept that it's ""imposter syndrome"", and many of my peers feel the same way."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else “Know What They Mean In Their Head” but you just can’t explain what you mean… is that a symptom of ADHD?,"It is not a symptom and is very common. It is just a sign that our brains often do not think in English, and things can get lost in translation."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a life so simple that you don’t know how to relate to new people because you don’t know how to describe yourself or what you do…because you don’t really do anything?,"I get this way often and when people asked what I did,  I’d just say “nothing if I can get away with it”.  It always redirects the conversation to other topics.  I recommend finding something to do, anything really.  Boredom got me in a very bad place mentally and it’s a self feeding cycle that’s tough to break."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE prefer having apps on dark mode,DAE breathe oxygen and drink water?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever feel like you have nothing to say and can't contribute to conversations,"Yes, only for like my entire life lol"

DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else notice how often ""woman"" and ""women"" are swapped and used incorrectly on the internet lately?",I notice all the time and it drives me crazy
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get tired of politics intruding their lives?,"IMO, the solution is not to escape politics, it's an important part of human life; definitely do not become politically inert, that's what those in control want. But, it's also very important to not let it take over everything and keep control of your life.


1) Be respectful and rational. The worst happens when people drop at least one of those.

2) Take breaks. Not everything you do needs to be about the current thing (politically).

3) Learn (books, videos, articles, whatever). So that you become less trapped by the current political storm and you can respond to it more appropriately."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get sharp sudden pain below their sternum?,"I am very much not a doctor, but your description reminds me of [precordial catch syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precordial_catch_syndrome)."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want an Animaniacs song that's just all of Trump’s legal issues?,Is this something you’re actually offering?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just get a wave of sadness out of nowhere?,"Sometimes mixed with self hatred, yeah"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE, upon learning that someone died, want to know the cause of death so you can determine how at risk you are from that particular cause of death?","No, I want to know out of pure nosiness"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like the ""Good Ole Days"" of the Internet are behind us?",All my flash games are gone forever. All of my chat sites are dead. Most of my favorite pirating stuff turned to shit too. 2012 were my favorite years
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE become extroverted and talkative around shy people but revert to their introverted self when they're around actual extroverts?,"Yeah I'm like this, it's kind of like code switching but with your personality. For me there's like a need to balance out the energy of the people around me."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sit on the toilet with their phone well after they are done peeing/pooping?,Literally as im reading this
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think most celebrities are not good, kind, loving people but actually narcissists and psychopaths?","Yes but I believe they weren’t always that way, it would be hard not to adopt those traits being such a high profile person with money and power"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE use their signal all the time? Like even for turns where there's only one option,"It’s a good habit to keep doing in any case, and you never know you might have missed someone. Indicator lights are for others benefit."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE fucking love storms and want it to get as aggressive as possible without your house falling apart?,"Only if I'm off work, which is one day a week. I absolutely hate having to drive to work in severe thunderstorms."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think the blackout did absolutely nothing, except cause inconvenience for the average user?","It did something alright, it made me realize we absolutely fucked if this site ever goes down considering how many searches I made in that 2 day window that I couldn't get an answer to because the best sources were all reddit.

Seems like all search results are these days is:

Static website with authored content

Static website with authored content

Static website that copies content of one of the first two

Blog that's either clearly shilling or is also a plagiarized copy of the first two sites

And so on"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have those moments where you could have sworn you lived through that exact moment before?,this post is giving me Déjà vu.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they arent doing enough in their day to day life ?,"No. My ultimate goal in life is to read books I like, listen to music I enjoy, drink some wine and travel occasionally."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE forget how to spell a word so you change your whole sentence?,No I find a synonym
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that all cryptocurrency is dumb and should just be deleted,"Eh I don’t care if others want to gamble. It’s not an asset class I would invest in, though."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find the sound of other people kissing repulsive?,"I dated someone who hated all mouth noises pretty much. Chewing, kissing, lip smacking, even beat boxing, it all drove her crazy. It’s definitely a thing."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wipe their ass so much that it bleeds after every shit?,"Everybody’s suggesting a bidet, which is cool, but if a normal heavy wipe is leading to a lot of bleeding, you probably have hemorrhoids. There is a laser surgery kind of like a dental surgery that can cauterize the blood vessels down there and minimize the problem. It’s a common problem with mothers and it’s really worth it to see what is available to make you more comfortable. Look into it, you’ll feel better just to know what the problem is."
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE noticed the bacon restaurants use on sandwiches is almost never crisp and usually tough and chewy?,Ask for crispy bacon
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get irritated by unnecessary sex scenes in movies and TV?,Yes and also the kissing noises! I’m not even bothered by noises - but were they using a dogs licking their balls soundboard or what the f?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE smell their dogs paws?,I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ME! I don't smell my dog's paws directly but he's a chihuahua and likes to burrow under covers with me when he sleeps and all his heat insulating his body scent makes the air start to simmer with the scent of CORN CHIPS and I thought I was crazy! Glad to know I'm not the only one who thinks so haha!
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE acknowledge the fact you are looking older, but when you see someone for the first time in a long time, you can’t believe how much OLDER they look?","When my wife and I went to her 40th high school reunion, the first one she had been to, she wasn't sure we were in the right place because there was only old people there."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE gets ""jumpscares"" when almost sleeping","Not sure whether being able to put a name to it will help, but it's called a [hypnic jerk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk).

There's quite a bit of literature studying them and suggestions on how to reduce them, but as far as I know, no way to 'cure' them."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not give a shit about whether or not they're conventionally attractive?,There's more to life than being really really ridiculously good looking
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it really comforting and relaxing when you can hear that the washing machine or dishwasher is on?,"When I was little my room was next to the laundry room, and my mom would start the washing machine at bedtime now it is very comforting to hear."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel more empathy for animals than humans?,"I feel more empathy for people and animals who can't take care of themselves. Whether it's a dog, cat, raccoon, or human. If they can't take care of themselves and depend on someone else for regular help, then yes. Yes I do."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE still think 2019 was LAST year?,"i’ve recently come to terms with 2021-2 being last year, but as of a month ago, YES"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have no “childhood” friends?”,"I moved around a lot when I was kid. I went to four different elementary schools in three different states. So definitely no childhood friends here, and I think all the school-switching may have been one of the things that affected my ability to connect with people and make friends."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not feel their age?,I'm 34 and I don't feel like I'm a day over 18 to be perfectly honest. We don't all age equally it seems.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel sorry for children being born today because of nostalgia?,"Well, they'll just have their own nostalgia on things we won't really understand."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE hear their neck ""creaking"" when wearing earplugs and moving their neck?",I hear my neck cracking without earbuds in. For me it’s just cartilage tho.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else typically not care if you go to a restaurant and find one or 2 hairs in your food?,"I know accidents happen. I could probably get over finding it in my food, if it wasn't super long. But if I find in my mouth, that whole pull and pull but it just keeps coming. 🤢🤮"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think the Superbowl is overrated?,"I'm English, I have never seen the owl, nor do I know what makes it so superb."
DoesAnybodyElse,Dae have no interest in travel?,"Honestly, I get this. Im traveling right now and I can’t wait to be home. I miss my bed, my cat, my routine, working out at home, all the clothes options, etc. I hate flying. I hate spending unnecessary money on eating out and drinks. Hotels, ubers, etc."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the internet makes life move way too fast these days?,"The older I get, the more I understand why the Amish decided to shun electricity in their private households. Not that I would avoid the internet entirely, but I prefer to keep it on my stationary computer so people dont expect my constant availability. Its not like ""internet=bad"", more of a ""time and place for everything, and the dinner table doesnt need social media"""
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever just sit and admire their partner’s beauty?,"I do.

She hates it, lol.

Sometimes I just can't help but stare at the woman I love and puzzle over why she loves me in return."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE miss quarantine during COVID year of 2020?,"No, because I wasn’t able to quarantine. I had to go to work and make very little money all while servicing ungrateful, nasty people. I was spit on at one point for enforcing wearing masks. I could barely make rent and was at a higher risk. Oh yeah, and people were dying. So, fuck no."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE notice that the grocery stores are selling less variety of most products and every week prices are increasing?,It makes me not want to go grocery shopping anymore.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE try to clean the toilet by peeing on the dirty spots?,mention the TOILET BOWL
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE despise attending weddings?,"Traditional weddings in themselves don't excite me. Picking out  the right gift, getting dressed up, eating the same shite food, cheesy dancing, cash bar, milquetoast pinterest/etsy flair, sitting at the rifraf table (somebody's college roommate, brides single uncle, grooms friend from work). etc gets old fast. If it's not for somebody I really care about, it's hard to enjoy. 

That being said, I've been to some kickass weddings recently. One of my friends had a wedding at a pub venue. The alt rock band he's in supplied the music, there was unlimited brews on tap, and of course pub trivia. We did an escape room for the stag party. So really, weddings can be alright. They just often aren't"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE only sleep on one side of the bed, even if you are the only one in it and there is plenty of room?",Way easier to get out of bed that way.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE, when finally getting out of a long line of slow traffic, accelerate quickly to ""prove"" to the other drivers in the line that you werent the one causing the slowdown?",Yes. You ever find yourself behind a slow moving vehicle and get a little further over toward the shoulder so they can see you're not in the front?
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE wish movies came with a ""Violence Towards Animals"" tag?",doesthedogdie com does just that
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE put their creamer in first when making coffee?,"When I used creamer, this is what I would do.

Pouring in the coffee second helped to mix the creamer in."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE eat their french fries plain without ketchup or other condiments?,always. only salt is needed bc i’m not a sauce person.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel irrationally angry when someone unexpectedly adds an unknown person to the plans that you've already organized?,"YES!! Had some people over to my house recently and only invited 10 people…2 of them invited like 3 people each, which in turn they invited someone."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE still wear a mask and why?,Im just ugly
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE accidentally screenshot their Lock Screen everyday?,My girlfriend went through her camera roll the other day and deleted about 20 screenshots of alarms going off
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not like Girl Scout Cookies?,"When I was a girl scout I remember people just donating money if they didn’t want the cookies. I remember a kind old man asked me what my favorite flavor was and bought that box and immediately gave it to me. 

Yes the cookies are not the best but they help raise funds for these girls to do awesome things. I grew up poor but was able to still do cool events with Girl Scouts because of the money we raised from cookie sales"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel it’s cowardly to advertise on Reddit with the comments turned off?,"Any time an ad allows comments it gets absolutely flooded with copypasta’s so i understand it from a brand perspective. that being said, the ad’s i pay the most attention are the ones with comments because they’re absolutely hilarious.

i also think it was more common for ad’s to have comments enabled a few years ago, i definitely see it less than i used to."
DoesAnybodyElse,IAE only getting ads on Reddit for the military and Jesus?,My ads are in Spanish for some reason. I don’t type in Spanish or go to Spanish subs or do anything that would warrant ads in Spanish
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever think about how good cats are at standing on your most tender spots,5:30 am: cat stands directly on my full bladder to tell me it's time to get up and feed him
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not care about the missing Titanic sub because it’s the ultimate in “rich people problems”?,"My lack of care isn't so much about it being rich people problems, but the fact that they decided to get into this contraption knowiing the risks/dangers."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the reason they don’t want kids is because they don’t enjoy life enough to want to bring someone else into this miserable world?,"Yes, 100%. I often wish I was never born, so I can’t imagine bringing another life into this world who may end up feeling the same way."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have a cat or dog that sleep practically all day, and only decide to be annoying AF at night when you want to go to sleep?","Ok so there's a distinction here. 

Cats are night hunters. They will go to sleep with you, wake up after a while, do their thing, and go back to sleep before you wake up. They can be noisy, yes, but it's their nature. You have to adapt on each particular case.

If a dog is hyperactive at night then there will be another reason. Most likely sounds you can't hear but he does. Are there any other pets nearby he can smell or hear? Are there cats moving around? Birds? Etc.. 

The most common solution is not to have a single pet, having someone to play and to take care of generally keeps them busy enough to distract them from other sources.

If both pets get engaged with something you better believe there is something even if you can't see it or hear it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE randomly break the fourth wall in case you’re stuck in the Truman show,I break the fourth wall by “Buellering.” I share my inner monologue to an imaginary camera to let them know my thoughts.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like 2022 sucked?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE play music in their mind almost all of the day?,"The same thing happens to me, and sometimes the same song can buzz around in my mind for *days,* and it can get quite *Quite* annoying sometimes."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have a teen daughter that sporadically undermines you, talks to you like they would a classmate/kid? What do you say or do?","You can’t pull an authority move on a teen girl without some repercussions. They are navigating independence and coming down on them with strict punishment will do one of two things. Make them resentful or make them liars. If you talk to them and tell them exactly why you are upset by their behavior and work out a compromise that both of you find acceptable, you teach them how to negotiate with other people."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find it annoying that there doesn’t seem to be any middle ground in politics anymore, just two insufferable extremes?",Can you please tell us what socially progressive and fiscally conservative means to you? I’m curious about your political positions.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else find most of the content of Tik Tok just really lame?,"I did at first but i think you have to get really invested beyond the surface level to get to the content that’s “addicting”. I’ve learned a wild amount of information from TikTok about things like history, cooking, gardening, medicine, etc. 

Today I watched a neurosurgeon explain why Tua Tagovailoa’s hands went up to his face and clenched like they did when he got a concussion earlier this week. I also watched a man have a stand-off with a llama while kayaking. There’s a very wide variety of content."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else prefer the hot over the cold?,"As a rule man is a fool

When it’s hot he wants it cool

When it’s cool he wants it hot

Always wanting what is not"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get disgusted when the shower liner clings to you while showering? 🧼,Get the ones with magnets at the bottom.  Even if your tub isn't metal the wgt. Will help.
DoesAnybodyElse,"IAE sick of how unbelievably shitty autocorrect has become, especially when it doesn’t recognize obvious contractions like ive/I’ve?",The worst is when it corrects a correct word for you but then misses obvious typos that are not in any dictionary.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE drive legally in video games?,I got a 9yo son and he spends almost all his time in Roblox driving everyone else around in a bus or helping people learn the game or build their house. His older brother let him try GTA once and he wanted to go to the grocery store lol
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it’s normal to brush their teeth in the shower?,"i love doing this so i’m as clean as i can be for one moment. and i enjoy the primal feeling of making a mess while brushing my teeth in the shower, letting it all run down my arms, not worrying about it. very liberating and pleasant."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel self conscious about using the word 'whom' correctly in a sentence because it sounds pretentious?,Nope. I literally just used it in another comment about half an hour ago. No regrets.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it's weird that in our cars we can reach and touch the other side but in busses we can't and they both can fit in a lane...,I think it's weird *now*
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE never, and i mean NEVER answer their phone whenever a random number u dont recognize is calling u?","Yes, never.  If someone needs me they will leave a message."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sleep on a mattress on the floor?,We got tiny steps for our dog. Or a small ramp would do it.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a good time and then see their reflection in the mirror and get depressed for the rest of the day?,"I  mean...yes, but for the next 5 minutes..then I forget about it"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like some people can find a way to justify their beliefs for anything regardless of how much evidence you can provide to refute their claims?,"All the time, the thing to learn is to give up early, save yourself a huge load of time that way."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE buy an extra order of fries in the drive thru to eat on the way home?,This is the first DAE that I’ve seen that is truly worth asking
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE randomly realize in the middle of a conversation that it's physically impossible to look the person in BOTH eyes so now they're focused on darting between both eyes instead of on the conversation?,I just look at the bridge of their nose.  makes them think I'm making eye contact.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they’re just not cut out for this world?,"For a long time (and still sometimes on hard days) I’d ask the stars why they put me here. Like earth wasn’t my home planet and I just wanted to go home.

Im sure it has something to with undiagnosed mental issues I have from childhood making me feel like I can’t connect to other humans. That im built different and wish others worked like i did. It doesn’t go away. But at least you can take solace in the fact that you’re definitely not alone in this feeling."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE shake when they yawn?,"Oh yeah, and most the time those are the most satisfying yawns"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ignore calls on purpose?,"I hardly ever answer phone calls, mainly because i hate phonecalls. If it's something important they'll leave a voicemail and I'll call back, otherwise they can send a text"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get really anxious & regretful after having conversations with people? & DAE then spend the rest of day thinking I shouldn't have said this now I look like a idiot?,"When was the last time you spent half a day thinking about how a certain person said something that sounded a little bit weird?

I bet it doesn't happen.  Now, understand that people will not be filling their head with your details either.  Let it go and nobody will remember it.  They are all too busy thinking about themselves.

Besides, do you really want to let someone into your life who spends their day nitpicking others?  Don't give them free room and board in your head.

Nobody's perfect.  You're not an idiot.  You're going to be okay."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have random sentences repeating in their head?,"Yes I have it too. I tend to notice that the phrases will start during a certain task. For example, when I blow dry my hair, a certain phrase or memory would pop in my head. I was super annoyed by it so I actively decided to make a new “associated thought”. So now when I do my hair, I think of that new thought instead of the old annoying one. I wonder if it’s OCD related where there’s a really strong “pathway” that the brain loves going down. But I’m not a neurologist/psych so take this with a grain of salt"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE enjoy music strictly for the sound and not the meaning of the songs?,"I used to be that way. When i finally started actively listening to lyrics, it soured a lot of stuff for me.  Now I listen to instrumentals that go hard and it's my happy place."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE absolutely refuse to make two trips carrying the groceries?,I string the plastic bags like 12 deep on each arm if I have to. No second trips
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get tired of constantly hearing about Elon Musk?,I didn’t hear about him today until you posted about him. Thanks!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get turned on by emotional intimacy,Almost everyone.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE pretend they’re a famished survivor in a post-apocalyptic film when eating soup and bread,Whenever I have a cup of tea I hold it with both hands and dramatically smile like I’m in a commercial for menstrual cramp medication.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have reoccurring dreams that they failed a class in highschool or college...or both?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel it in their teeth when someone touches cotton or rips it?,"Yes I get this it’s definitely a thing, another one for me is styrofoam rubbing on stuff hate that"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wonder what it's like to die?,yeah and everytime i do i get a damn existential crisis
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Feel strange or even embarrassed when hearing their own voice in a video?,"Yeah it's a pretty common experience. We hear our voices differently when talking. 

There are some jokes around it. A store had a sign that said ""shoplifters will be played a recording of their own voice"""
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they’re always one conversation or event from slipping back into depression?,"I felt that way for a long time. I chocked it up to “cheraphobia.” 

Eventually I talked with a psychiatrist and got on meds for my anxiety and depression. Having someone to talk to and medication really helped.  

I’m in no way cured but I fell like I’ve stepped from the ledge to more stable ground."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does Anybody Else go shopping during the Super Bowl because you know no one else will be in the stores?,The five people who are with me at the mall during the Super Bowl please raise your hand!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever think if they were a bit more of an asshole then they’d go further in life?,"I did better when I was more of an asshole. As soon as I stated being nice and following the rules, people took advantage of me. I may go back to being more harsh, although I’ve truly mellowed out in older age so I kind of don’t want to."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE who smokes weed only like getting a little high?,I prefer a mild high. I’m a daily smoker so being able to function normally is a priority.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they can't turn their overthinking off?,"I would say you need to try meditation. Learning to be in stillness is as much a discipline as running long distances, and you won't be able to manage it the first time you try and maybe not even the 7th time you try. Most say it takes around a month to really figure out how to get themselves into the meditative state. There are those that teach it as well as apps. If you decide to try, set the time aside and commit to it on a regular basis. I can't properly quantify how much meditation has helped me, and maybe it won't help you, but I thoroughly recommend you give it a try."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Really like Blue Cheese,"Yep! I'm not a ranch fan, I far prefer bleu cheese!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get these feelings of wanting to start over?,I think that’s about as common as masturbation.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE 's dad not want to admit he's sleeping while watching TV?,"My dad used to do this all the time when he still worked. Now that he’s retired, when I’m visiting the house and he nods off, he can finally admit that he was indeed catching Z’s. 

I think he denied it so that we wouldn’t feel bad for him being too tired to relax, watch TV, watch a movie, etc, with us. He worked hard and we appreciated him for that. There’s no shame in being tired when there’s a good reason to be.

*Edit - I think it could also be a physiological thing. Possibly, your dad wishes he wasn’t too tired to do simple things, like watch TV, so he rather just act like he was “resting his eyes.”"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get upset from seeing trash on the side of the road or etc?,the most shocking to me was seeing the trash on the front lawn of a church.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ask the person to repeat themselves even though you heard exactly what they just said?,"My ears hear it but it takes longer for my brain to hear it. At that point, I’ve already said “what” 🤷‍♀️"

DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE skip videos when it says, ""Wait for it""",Every single time
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think about the people they've never met?,When I’m out and about and see someone through their car window or walking around a corner I often wonder what kind of life they’re traveling off to lead.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE ever pick their nose so habitually and aggressively that they leave a little wound that scabs over -- but then the scab feels like another booger, trapping you in a never ending cycle of scabooger picking?","
Sort of.  In my late thirties I started getting nose bleeds from the inner lining of my nostrils being dry and irritated. The dried blood is super irritating and it hurts. It feels like daggers forming in there. Picking them temporarily relieved the pain so I could concentrate but then they would bleed, clot and harden. I saw an allergist and an ENT and nothing worked. 

Eventually I googled or read on reddit about a humidifier helping. The solved it. I run it pretty much every night now and it stopped not only the irritated nose lining but also stopped my lip from splitting and bleeding too. Also, And my mom(an RN) told me to put antibiotic ointment on the sores which was a decent temporary fix. But the humidifier solved it from reoccurring completely."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like sleeping with a fan blowing on them but being burried under the covers?,[removed]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like to drink milk by itself?,Liking Milk is normal...hating water is what seems weird...
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Does anyone else sometimes feel like they’re caught between a generation of bullies who thought you were too progressive and a generation of bullies who think you’re not progressive enough?,"You're literally describing the internet. Real life, imo, is a lot more nuanced and open minded (generally).

The internet is where a lot of people go to misplace their anger. You won't get away with most of that kind of behaviour in polite society."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like every year in the 1990s and 2000s feels discrete and distinct from one another, but that everything from 2010 and on feels like one big blur?",Let me use my magic powers to guess what years you were in grade school and what years you were not.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE notice that no matter what the subject is, there's somebody that will be offended by it.","Yep, and theres even people getting offended by the fact that other people are offended by things that the aforementioned are not offended about."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Have A Near Constant Internal Dialogue In Their Head?,"Is that not like, our default setting? 😬

I just assume everyone is like this."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they have some undetectable chronic illness that makes them physically weak/sensitive?,"Could be a heart issue. I'd get my heart checked if I were you. How's your blood pressure? Do you get dizzy easy?

Even if it's a no & your BP is good I'd still get your heart checked. It could be as simple as upping your sodium intake to raise your BP a little. Or it could be serious. Heart problems can cause what you are describing. Just because you're young doesn't mean you're safe from heart disease.

I am biased. My aorta popped a few years ago. My whole life my Dr's told me BP is a little high, nothing to worry about. I had to have emergency open heart surgery in my late 30's. If I'd gotten myself checked it would've just been a pill or 2 in the morning instead I almost died from an aortic dissection."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever wonder if purgatory is actually real and that we’re currently living in it?,I feel like this all the fucking time.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever feel like staying in bed and not wanting to face the world,"Meeeee since childhood

Bed is my world"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE use cruise control every second they can?,"I feel like traffic would be SOOOOO much better if everyone used adaptive cruise control. Right lane, set it at the speed limit. Left lane, a little higher. And then we're all cruising along, not someone going 15 over then 5 under every few minutes. I was going 72 in a 65, passed a lady in the middle lane. She realized I passed her, she started going 75-80. She comes up next to me, realizes she is going too fast, slows back down to 65."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE much prefer eating out of bowls instead of off of plates?,Plus stuff can't fall off the edge
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get scared they're gonna get stabbed whenever they hear someone walking behind them?,"No, but I still don't like people walking up on me fast. I will absolutely turn around over my shoulder and see what they are up to, and I don't care if it's weird."
DoesAnybodyElse,"Has anybody else noticed that a lot of people who make self uploads onto ""wholesome"" subs are peddling OnlyFans/NSFW content?","Not necessarily wholesome, but the cosplay subreddit has turned into an onlyfans advertising subreddit"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like time is going faster with age?,"They say life in your 20's goes by at 20 miles per hour

30's at 30 miles per hour.

40's at 40 miles per hour, etc.

For me, life passes passes by in terms of garbage day.  Garbage day here is Wednesday.  It just seems that it's garbage day and next thing I know, it's garbage day again.

Sigh."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like 2018 was the last good year?,"It seems to be. 
2019 had a cancer diagnosis/treatment. 
2020-2021 shall remain unspoken. 
2022 had me involved in a motorcycle crash. 
That being said, I still start each new year with cautious optimism of a good year ahead and 2023 is no different. I’m still cancer free, good health and still around to celebrate birthdays."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE go through so much in a short pint of time that instead of feeling sad, you feel nothing?","Disconnected? It's very common with anxiety and depression. I felt like I'd basically checked out and couldn't feel sad, happy or anything. I figured it was voluntary and a way of coping by switching off. Please OP, speak to a mental health professional."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE miss buttons?,"Good god yes I do! Mostly for all of the satisfying “click”, “chuck”, “snap”, and “ca-thunk-a” noises they provided."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE cum in their sleep?,A study published in 1986 indicates that 85% of women have experienced a nocturnal orgasm by the age of 21. Read more [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_emission)
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE grab door handles where you think the fewest people have touched them?,I push with a fist and pull with a pinky.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel guilty when they get sick?,"If it’s a lot of guilt, that might be a sign that you’re a little too giving. One of my friends told me that guilt tells us about our morals and values, and thinking about that has actually been super helpful while trying to figure out my emotions"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think of something they are going to do/search etc., get distracted by something else and then try to trace back all the thoughts they had and things they were doing a few moments before to remember what they were going to do?","Happens to me frequently. Sometimes I can just retrace my steps and something I see sparks the lost memory. Or while scrolling online, just scroll backwards. 
And then there are times it just doesn’t come back. Doesn’t happen often, but I notice it happens when I’m doing / thinking of several things in the same timeframe."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE avoid wearing clothes or shoes that you really like because you’re afraid of ruining them?,"Yup, I don't want to ""waste"" them. It gets hard now because I work from home and I really want to wear them, but what's the point when no one else will see them?"
DoesAnybodyElse,IAE fucking sick of how difficult it is to post anything on here because of insanely strict the moderation is?,"My favorite is when you make a post and it appears in your profile as if it's been posted but never actually shows up on the subreddit, and you get no notifications as to why."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE delete their posts when it doesn't make the cut?,"No.

I'm one of those who deletes *before* posting though because 'ah fuck, who gives a shit' or 'why am I trying to educate some internet random? """
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE not want children, because you feel like life is already stressful enough?","First I was like that too, but then I see poor people where i live keep pumping out kids like there's no tomorrow. 

Then i also see rich people here getting married and celebrating their pregnancies and first birthdays and second childs.

I think this condition is only affecting middle income people..."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE read Wednesday as wed-nes-day?,"No, but sounding it off in my head like that is the only way I remember how to spell it."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else type a comment just to delete it?,Most of the times when I do this i realise how dumb I sound
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have recurring dreams for YEARS of an unknown place but you keep going to it in your dreams?,"I used to dream of a weird beach where I start off on top of like a bike path on a forested cliff and I run down to the beach and get on a train and a shark chases me through the train and I get off and there's this unending pier, and at one point on the pier I look down in the water and there's a duck swimming underwater like a turtle and I look up and there's a turtle flying like a duck. And then there was this huuuuuge gap and I'd always try to run and jump it but I'd always miss and instead of hitting the water I'd fall into a lava cavern with a bunch of narrow rocks and eventually I'd fall in and wake up. But one time I made the pier jump and woke up and that was the last time I ever had that dream."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else experience anxiety/fear when about to look at their bank/checking account?,"Yep lol 

Overcoming the anxiety only happened when I ,,, actually had money"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE constantly shake their leg when sitting down?,"Yup…..ADHD  and anxiety are a bitch. I was just shaking my leg, when I read ur post."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a job that pays well and is too stressful but you can't leave because you were lucky to get it and you are not qualified to do any work in the same pay range?,"I am a 911 dispatcher, I know I have skills I just don't know how to translate those skills into a different type of work without a big pay cut. I'm trying though, because I need to get out. The stress is going to kill me otherwise."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE very short and get irritated with loved ones (family and spouses) but have endless patience for friends/colleagues/strangers,"Yes, I’m glad to see I’m not alone. I feel terrible guilt over this."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE always skip through “previously” “next time” and “coming up” clips in tv shows?,"I consider next episode previews to be spoilers, and it pisses me off to no end when a show has them."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have trouble enjoying things because you see everyone else as creative but you aren't?,"Comparison is the thief of joy.

Don't worry about other people, or you'll never be happy. You do you. In time, you'll find that you are just as creative as others. More than likely, the people you look up to feel the same as you. We are all very good at hiding our insecurities."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just want to be touched sometimes,"I miss being held, having my back rubbed, having someone -anyone- hold my hand. My body feels so lonely some days."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else have absolutely no qualms with taking a massive dump in the bathroom?,Literally what the bathroom is for. People who make fun of people who are using the bathroom for it’s intended purpose suck
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE love the sound of tires over gravel?,"Oh HELL YES! I think it does have something to do with hearing it from youth. I lived in Europe where we had dirt roads so I was always hearing it. Now, I miss that sound and it's a real treat to hear it. It's like ear candy, I love it and I know exactly how you feel."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Have weirdly strong suicidal thoughts when thinking of old embarrassing memories?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get heavily affected by getting scolded at, even if they don't care, to the point that they still think about it hours later?","Yeah, I have a weird thing with authority figures where I need them to like me. I don't care what strangers think, but if they're my boss or professor, I can't handle thinking they are disappointed in me."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not really uncontrollably laugh anymore?,"Yea, I used to laugh like crazy in my 20s and younger. Not sure if it’s because I’ve been exposed to more things, if my humor has changed, if my humor hasn’t changed but what is considered funny has changed, or if I’m just running on a chronic mild depression lol."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE can’t eat your food until you’ve found the right thing to watch on TV?,"YES!!! I usually prepare something to watch because of that, I just need the combination of good food and good entertainment."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like animals more than they like humans,"I did most of my life, and I still love animals but I realized I had to ditch the “I hate people” attitude because that mindset was turning me into the very thing I claimed to hate: a shitty person."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a friend who puts zero effort into the friendship?,"Yeah, I have had in the past. I cut them loose."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE thinks it’s crazy that plastic surgery is so trivialized?,And everyone is starting to look the same 😣
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Say answers out loud when watching a TV game show alone to make everyone knows you got it right (even though no one is there)?,If you don't say it out loud you don't get the point
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else find it annoying when misused words become standard?,"Not sure if it counts but ""could care less"" as opposed to ""couldn't care less"" The former implies the opposite of what the speaker is trying to convey. 

Although it's been used wrong for so long now it's almost...right?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE enjoy the autumn time change because they're sick of seeing daylight?,Time change = dumb
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think they could have undiagnosed adult autism,"I just got a formal diagnosis of autism, and Im 29 years old. Ive had different providers speculate I was on the spectrum almost my whole life, but never got any kind of testing. My sensory issues and communication style have been major hang ups in previous work environments, so I finally bit the bullet and got tested so Id be protected at my newish place of employment.

Im very happy I got tested. The place I went gave me a ton of supportive materials and practical suggestions for navigating some of the issues I have faced due to my neurodivergence. 

I believe a lot of people fall somewhere on the spectrum, though it oftentimes doesnt affect someone to the point of seeking a diagnosis. It sounds like you are running into enough discomfort in your household that it may be worth looking into. There are plenty of places that test adults, though it is typically not cheap. For reference, my initial appointment was $150, and then my testing appointment was $700. 

Perhaps if you get a diagnosis and share the journey with your husband/family, they can support you correctly and better understand your comfort levels in certain situations."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE shower and get ready at night so that you can just wake up and go to work?,I never got this. Doesn’t your hair get all messed up and bent while you sleep? What do you do with it in the morning?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find Discord confusing to operate?,"Yup! I’ve tried several times to get into using Discord, but the user experience is balls. I feel the same about Snapchat."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find tans on people unattractive?,"What about I am outdoors all day hiking, working in my garden, tending to my lodge tans?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE go to bed and lie on their side but sometimes forget how their arm is supposed to be positioned for it to be comfortable and for it to not fall asleep?,"I sleep on my right side. I cross them in front of me, across my chest, like the cliche old vampire movies. Right arm on left shoulder, left on right. Nothing pinned."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a piece of pencil lead stuck on their skin?,50 years ago I was accidentally stabbed in my right forearm with a pencil. A small gray spot remains to this day.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have this weird fear that people can read your thoughts?,"Yes, yes I do."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE miss the days when How-To articles were predominantly in written form rather than video?,"I'm so with you on this.

 I'd rather spend five minutes reading a game walk-through article over watching a video that is SO MUCH longer than it needs to be.

A video showing where a button is located has NO REASON to be TEN MINUTES LONG.

 Another thing that annoys me off is when I find a short video (1-2 minutes), I click on it and find out almost all of it is just the intro and outro or the creator TALKING about what they're about to do instead of actually DOING IT."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find themselves listening to music from years ago and not finding anything new that they like?,"It's just called getting older.

Everyone thinks the very best music came out when they just happened to be the most emotionally attached to music.

Except me, because 1994 was literally the best year in music."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get overly disgusted by the sound of chewing?,"Absolutely but I get intense rage at the sound, want to throat punch anyone chewing in a 10ft radius ha"
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else have depression that hinders goals such as education, and people still wonder why you are so far behind, even after explaining to them why?","I have ADHD that causes most of my dysfunction and depression. However, recognizing it and learning how to work with it has been a great help. Sometimes simple things like being able to work from a different location. I would spend days on a task that would take me an hour or less in my productive times. So instead of sitting paralyzed and getting further behind I started changing my environment. My boss and coworkers hated it and bitched at everything they could. The results don't lie though. I spend more time happy and productive. I was finally able to thrive around here, even outshine my peers often. I no longer sit at my desk and stare frustrated that my brain just won't cooperate. 

It has been 6 months since I put my foot down for my own needs. I have gotten a 35% raise, the second biggest office in the building, and was just recently asked to speak at a conference on my employers behalf. 6 months ago I was a mess of imposter syndrome and ADHD paralysis. 

Find what isn't working and change it. You can do this."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE miss that short window of time from late 1999 to before 9/11 when the new millennium seemed awesome and exciting?,"Ya, I wish I would just wake up and it was January 1st, 1999"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel they have never found 'their people' and that you have somehow not met all the people you may have clicked with,"I'm 50, I've only met one of my people. She is my bestie. We search for others of like mind, but so far, no luck"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE really like the smell of hardware stores? Menards, ACE, Lowe’s, and Home Depot smell amazing.",Yes!!!!! I do!!!!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think porn is absolute garbage and not sexy or stimulating at all?,"as a girl I’ve always hated porn. i NEVER understood how other girls get off to porn, it’s always seemed ridiculously fake, unrealistic and honestly cringe as fuck. 

there’s always way too much dick sucking in straight porn too, and it’s almost entirely focused on the male gaze between the angles and the fact that the girl is the only one moaning 99% of the time. also a lot of time the guy looks like he’s actually hurting the girl and like it doesn’t feel good at all.

maybe I haven’t watched enough because I could never really give it the time of day, i just think it sucks and frankly… if I’m not the one being füçked idrc 💀💀💀 I don’t see the hype with watching other people have sex it’s like “okay and…”"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like being a woman just seems so complicated?,And just when you think you have that part figured out.....BAM.... menopause! Fun times!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get the feeling that a pill is 'stuck' in your throat even if it's not?,"yes. usually it's because it is, though."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get pissed off by stray hairs touching their skin?,"Yes, in my bra, buttcrack but especially that ducking underarm tickle. I just feel myself come unglued lol"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like some people just aren't meant for relationships?,"Yes. Me, for example. :‘)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get a weird kick out of peeling dried glue off their hands?,"Yes, many people do. 

Unfortunately, most of us got mental health issues as adults, lol... Good luck"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE regret not trying hard enough from a young age?,"You've not ruined your life. You are comparing yourself to others and this attitude makes you think that you've done bad. People take different roads to get to where they want, and sometimes you need to touch rock bottom to know where the surface is. I'd see it as warning that something in you is telling you that you need to change, maybe your attitude, maybe your goals, who knows.   
Don't confuse money and professional success with being content with your life."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE genuinely not wanna do anything in life?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE read the TL;DR even though you read the whole thing?,Every time
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE, sit in their rooms naked after taking a shower?",Yes. Air drying is the way. That way I can clearly tell the difference between when I am still wet and already sweating lol
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE whistle by sucking in?,Omg i found my people
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel no urge whatsoever to visit any bands' concerts no matter how you love a band?,A concert has sounded like an absolutely terrible time to me no matter how much I like the band. I would hate to be surrounded by people in such a loud environment. That seems like an absolute nightmare.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE kinda wish the human population was more like a billion or fewer people rather than near 8 billion?,"I understand your point, but the education and work opportunities would remain approx. equally competitive, since there’d be less job openings and universities in general"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE brush their teeth while in the shower?,I have adhd and this guarantees I don’t forget at night.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE speak gibberish to drown out unwanted or embarrassing thoughts?,"I even try to shake it off, toss my head around d a little to wiggle it out of me!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it’s idiotic how many people subscribe to the two party political system?,"For anyone who doesn't know, the two party system is the result of our first-past-the-post election system.  If there are more than two parties, the two parties that are closest to each other will cannibalize each other's votes and you can (and do) end up with situations where the winner is actually the group that is the least popular.  

As an example, say there are 5 parties, 1-4, and 5.  1-4 are all fairly similar but may differ on some major issues.  5 is by far the least popular, but they've carved out their own niche and none of the other parties are like them.  On election day, 1-4 evenly split 75% of the vote,  while 5 captures the remaining 25%.  Since 1-4 each got less than 20%, that leaves 5 as the winner, even though only 25% of the people would have picked 5 as their first choice.  To prevent this from happening, 1-4 join together to form a single bloc, since they are far more similar than different, and suddenly, you end up where we are now, with only 2 parties."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel too emotionally blocked off to listen to new music most of the time?,"Whoa. Yeah, exactly this. Even from artists I loved before. It’s not even that I don’t think I’ll like it, it’s like “ugh but I’ll have to listen to it,” or almost like I feel bad for the music? In the same way I’d feel about getting a text from a person I know I should respond to, but know it’s going to be a whole conversation. 

Maybe I’m just an emotionally shut off asshole?

Even with songs that put me in a good mood in the past, sometimes I feel like I don’t have the energy to get in a good mood, or any mood, other than just what I’m doing anyway. 

Sorry for taking this one over with my own issues. I didn’t realize I did some version of this until now"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE cringe at the constant ""this."" replies","I also hate when people say something and follow with ""now read that again."""
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE not watch a movie because it's ""too long"" but end up watching 3 hours of YouTube",I did not expect to be specifically and viciously attacked like this just scrolling through Reddit.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have strange childhood memories where you're not sure if they were things that actually happened or were just vivid dreams?,"I have a vague memory of being taken by grandparents to a toy store at age 2. Everything looked huge , the toy shelves looked like towers to me higher than I could reach. I felt overwhelmed and wanted to leave. I thought it was a dream until my grandma told me she did take me to a toy store and I had a meltdown and she could not figure out why."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get weirded out when their MIL sits on their husband's lap?,I've never seen or heard of a mother doing this with her adult child
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE become instantly uninterested in a product after seeing an ad for it?,Only if the ad is incredibly irritating
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE actually enjoy their life?,People who are enjoying their life tend not to post about it on the internet because they're busy enjoying their life. The people who aren't enjoying their life tend to post more because they want to feel less alone.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE wish they could ""show"" other people their memories instead of explaining or talking about them?",Did you see that episode of Black Mirror?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they're constantly doing something wrong?,I always feel like this. That’s what anxiety is. It can be subtle and it can also make you invent ridiculously extreme scenarios to the point where you believe they’re real.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that /s ruins the joke?,For the longest time I thought it meant serious
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE consider people who don't need mental/emotional medication (Zoloft, Xanax, etc.) lucky?","The treatment of mental and emotional issues is dynamic, not static. I used to take Xanax for my anxiety, but I no longer do. Sometimes situations change, and sometimes we pick up new tools to handle stress, anxiety, and depression a little better. And then other times, people find a medication or treatment regimen that meets their needs and they can live a more normal life."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel dumb after sending kind words and getting no response?,"In corporate we always say, “assume good intent” to help with these kinds of situations. Assume they were just sick or busy or whatever and get on with your day, mental health intact ❤️‍🩹"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think people who workout in the sauna should be canceled?,People do this???
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get shooting pains in your butthole from time to time?,"Rarely but usually it's when I'm on my period, it's a weird uncommon symptom apparently"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Miss being super horny?,"Homie seems to only be responding to the chicks and he’s sketching me out wicked hard.

The answer is a hard “no”; because I don’t think you have the right idea of what you’re asking to begin with, and you’re asking mad weird questions after."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE pretend to be blind in the dark at home to see if they can still navigate their way around. Or close their eyes when they're walking to see what it's like if they were blind?,"Yes I definitely do, just to test my senses and be random.  I'm glad I am not the only one who normally does this."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever sit on the toilet in a locked bathroom simply as an escape?,I sometimes do that at work...
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like halogen headlights have the same effect on other drivers as using brights?,"yes, it's gotten out of hand. There should be regulations about it at this point"
DoesAnybodyElse,"IAE sick of the corny internet phrases that get overused like “woodchipper go burrrrr,” “my sweet summer child,” “sir this is a Wendy’s” and “found in the wild?”",I also choose this guy's dead wife
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE Get ""buyer's remorse"" after making a large purchase, even if you needed what you bought?","""satisfaction is the death of desire """
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else do the courtesy flash? (warning opposite traffic there is a cop ahead) Is this still a thing?,"I do it to warn of animals on or near the road. Deer, cattle, etc."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else strive to achieve the blessed 'Ghost Wipe' after a poo?,"It's amazing if it happens, but to me it happens randomly. Actually had it yesterday. I can go weeks without it. It's just a nice surprise.

I have more of those days that you keep wiping and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just shut everyone out when there’s too much to process?,"Yes! 
When I receive too much info to process(mostly just sounds,people talking or a conversation I am not interested in), I just concentrate on a random object,usually something small and unrelated. I forget about everybody else and I feel like am floating in thought, alone. It is surprisingly calming but it does sometimes make me miss crucial information exchanges in conversation or my queue to talk :)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever get sick of how everyone uses the same expressions on the internet ad nauseam?,Love that for you
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE given up on their big dreams and are now just chilling with how life is?,"I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up.

I'm 40."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE habitually bite tiny bits of skin off the insides of their cheeks?,Was doing this AS I READ THE POST 😂
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that suicide (perhaps assisted) is a no-brainer if they got dementia, lost their legs, or some other major downgrade in quality of life?","I always figured if I knew I was gonna go out in a bad way I’d try out crack and heroin. Maybe at the same time. With hookers. I ain’t trying to ride it out for long, but I want that last ride to be a good time.

Edit: Damn y’all. I’m not suicidal. Read for context. There’s a sharp difference between avoiding meaningless suffering versus the depression finally getting my ass."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that Valentine’s Day is stupid ??,"I love it. Married 20 years and I think it's a fun, happy day that makes people feel warm and fuzzy. 

Yeah you can celebrate love on other days too, but why not this one as well? It doesn't have to be cliched or expensive - you can make it what you want. 

I love seeing people buying flowers for each other, going to dinner, heart balloons in shops, etc. 

I feel like the people who hate it are the same people who complain about Christmas being too commercial or Halloween existing. To me they're all just fun things to enjoy throughout the year."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they're not allowed to go to family oriented places alone?,"Its definitely not sad to go enjoy whatever it is you want to do alone or with people.    If anything it's sad that you're not doing these things because life is too damn short to not enjoy yourself.   

You probably don't want to be handing out free candy to kids or anything creepy like that but if youre just minding your own business having fun nobody should be bothered."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE not understand why so many people commonly misspell “lose” as “loose”? There are other common misspellings that I understand, but those two words don’t even sound the same.","Lose - pronounced /luːz/

Loose - pronounced /luːs/

Really quite similar, especially when speaking quickly.

Many languages feature ""final devoicing"", when voiced consonants (such as /z/) at the end of a word are replaced with their voiceless counterparts (such as /s/). [Some English accents/dialects have a limited form of it too](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final-obstruent_devoicing#English). So, people who had those as their first language may make this mistake.

My first language is Russian, and I got so used to mistakenly devoice final consonants, that I over-correct and pronounce both words as /luːz/. In fact I only learned about the difference in pronunciation from your post (thank you!)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get excited when you notice a movie or show was filmed where you live?,When you’ve lived in Toronto you start to notice how half the films set in New York look mighty familiar lol.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get that shitty anxiety hot/cold thing?,"Especially in the mornings before leaving for the day. I’ll be cold but sweat straight through my shirt before I even do anything. It’s not fun, but you are not alone

Edit: I am writing this from the parking lot of the dentist. A whole 45 minutes early because waiting to leave the house kills me"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE close cooler doors that were left slightly cracked open in convenience and grocery stores?,"Of course, it's just common courtesy. I used to hear the door-open alrm on a cooler at a store near me everytime I went so I would walk over, look for an obstruction then close the door. It just didn't have a strong auto closing mechanism and I guess the customers didn't want to push it all the way closed. I told an employee about it and eventually it stopped happening. Can you imagine how shitty the world would be if everyone, every time had the attitude of ""that's not my job so screw it""."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that Daphne from Scooby Doo is “the hot one” not Velma?,"I think Daphne *was supposed* to be ""the hot one"" haha"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get random stinging sharp pains like a needle pinprick for no reason randomly?,Voodoo doll has entered the chat.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Use Their Hands to Squeegee Themselves After a Shower,"Not the only one, I do it too! IMO it speeds up the drying process because you get rid of the bulk of the water. It's like the difference between putting a paper towel on a damp countertop VS a big puddle."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else feel like pre- 2012 was a whole another universe and is distant past from now?,"I hear you; technology has evolved exponentially since then, so it's no wonder it seems like a different universe now"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE catch a glimpse of themselves in the mirror or in a picture and for a brief moment realize that you look nothing like the image that you have of yourself in your mind?,"Where did that old, fat, bald man come from?"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else listen to the same song over and over?,I once listened to Dark Side of the Moon CD for 2 years straight.  I left it in the cd player in the car and it would just pick up where it was before I turned the car off.  It was on repeat for about 2 years.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE really notice when written and heard words coincide? For instance, say you’re reading a document for work that mentions the benefits of a new initiative, and just then you hear on the radio that the government will be paying benefits to a particular group.",This happens to me a lot and when I’m with someone I’ll point it out. It’s almost like a sense of deja vu. Obviously it’s not the same thing but it has that almost supernatural feel to it.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have close family they've cut off because of the family member's aggressiveness about Trump? How are you coping?,"Not because of Trump per se, but my mother got sucked into QAnon and a bunch of other conspiracy theories. And since QAnon imagines Trump as a hero fighting an underground Satanist, cannibalistic pedophile and sex trafficking ring, she is naturally very protective of Trump. We're not in America and she doesn't read or speak English, but apparently the word of Q gets translated.

The final straw that made me cut her off was when she threatened to kill herself if I took the COVID vaccine, as she believed it was a poison devised by Bill Gates and the rich elite to sterilise and kill the masses."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that if we had shorter work weeks there would be more time for “living of life things” and maybe, time wouldn’t fly by so fast.",I do think a shorter work week would make life more enjoyable it could also encourage more consideration of how we think about each other less about position in the workplace and more about community.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE live in the extremes w/ depression? I don’t eat until I’m about to pass out from hunger, I have to force myself to go to sleep every night, I have trouble taking showers if it isn’t absolutely necessary, I have trouble cleaning regularly, I wait until the very last minute to do anything, etc.","Yes to all of the above. Its horrible. But you just have to not give up and keep plodding along. I can go weeks without stepping foot outside my front door. I don't shop in shops I do everything online. Other than seeing my sister and nephews every now and then I avoid social interactions as much as I'm able because I just don't have the mental endurance to be able to listen to people's shit. I get so angry. I feel okish sometimes but the majority is torture. But I will no give up and neither will you.

Better things are coming 🤗"
DoesAnybodyElse,Dae have a box full of stickers that they don’t want to commit to sticking to things?,This is basically every sticker I've ever gotten.  I don't understand why people like stickers.  They just cause me endless anxiety.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE dread the idea of having to work all their lives?,"Yes, I’m 26 and idk what I want to do for the rest of my life. Terrified of choosing something I’ll absolutely hate and then I’m stuck 😅"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have an internal monologue where they refer to themselves as “we”,"I don't really know what determines it, but I use almost all pronouns interchangeably in my inner monologue. We, I, you, dude, he, etc. Whatever fits in the moment I guess"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have a lot of trouble getting up in the morning, but once you’re up you have a lot of difficulty getting back to sleep, whether it’s for a nap or bedtime, because you’re too wound up and can’t get your brain to turn off?","Only time I get like that is if I didn't to enough in the day to use up my energy.

If I walk my 10,000 steps and I work and cook and clean etc then I sleep like a baby."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE make random bets with themselves, like if you can put all the food away before the microwave stops you win $1000.","sort of but it's more along the lines of ""if you can get this done in X amount of time, you can then do X thing after"""
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it impossible to do anything before an appointment/social engagement?,Yep I totally get this. It’s why I hate having meet-ups and stuff late in the day. It’s like the whole day is given to it and I can’t do anything else.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Feels like they don't feel caffeine?,"If you drink enough of it, especially strong coffee like espresso, you down-regulate caffeine receptors (meaning less of them become available) so the effect of caffeine diminishes. Take a break from all caffeine (including soda!) for like a month or 2 and it should affect you more once you drink it again."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE always have a feeling they’re gonna get robbed before a tinder date or hookup?,"I often think that, but then I remind myself: what are the odds of both of us trying to rob the other?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE click on posts to read only to immediately leave when you see how long the post is?,"If it's broken down into paragraphs I may read it, but if it's one big wall of text, I'm out."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE who is an adult, feel like they are mature but combined with a child-like personality?","Definitely. I try to be responsible with my job and mortgage, but on my off time, it's a funny mix of adult and kid hobbies. I still love comics, cartoons, video games and board games."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have recurring nightmares about forgetting an exam/assignment or a whole course from years ago and having their diploma taken back?,Yep. Except mine is always college level. I’m registered for a Tuesday/Thursday course and it’s finals week and I seemed to have never attended any classes or complete any assignments.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think TikTok is by far the most narcissistic “hey look at me” social media platform yet?,"Not really. It doesn't feel any worse than Instagram. I think ever since Instagram and Twitter changed the dynamic of social media from ""friends"" to ""followers"", the point for most people became having as many eyes as possible on them. 

It blows my student's minds when I tell them how Facebook was originally designed to enhance your real life. All your friends were people you know in real life or people at your school that you wanted to get to know in real life. 90% of my Facebook friends today are still people I've met in real life and the other 10% are friends of people I know in real life. 

We would literally go through our Facebook friends lists and DELETE people that we never interacted with online because that was the point. People write their Instagram/Twitter handles on sidewalks and bathroom stalls because they literally want anyone to follow them to raise their number of followers."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think those who don't obey traffic laws have low intelligence?,"I think it's more of a disregard for society and it's rules.  For the most part, things are designed for safety in mind.  That shoulder? It is used for emergencies, not for someone who only thinks of themselves to fly by traffic."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Get Money From Their Parents Even When They Don’t Ask For It?,Hey it's me your long lost sibling.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have an absolute crippling fear of death or dying? If so, what are some ways to cope?","I once fell off a boat in the middle of the ocean on a fishing trip. The waves were rough and choppy, the currents were strong. I can swim but am not the fittest person in the world - I also wasn’t wearing a life jacket. The boat couldn’t reverse to come and get me because there was a massive rock just behind where it was. To top it all off, we knew there was a massive shark lurking around somewhere, because it had bitten off the body of the 200lb tuna we caught earlier, leaving us with just the head.

In that moment I thought I was going to die. I saw my dad’s face full of fear looking back at me from the boat. I kept swimming but I fully accepted the fact that I was only a 5ft tall, 20-something year old woman in a vast and ancient expanse of water that existed long before I did, and will continue to exist into the future long after I die.

I knew I was powerless. But I kept swimming, and the skipper eventually found a float to throw at me. I hung onto it while he dragged me back into the boat. 

That day taught me that when the time comes, you won’t even be thinking about your fear. You’d either experience an adrenalin rush as you’re trying to survive, or saying your goodbyes to your loved ones, or it just happens and you won’t even realise it - depending on the circumstances in which you die. 

So don’t waste the moments by which you can enjoy your life through worrying about the day your story in this world comes to a close. And remember that your story is never really closed even when you’re physically not on this earth - even if you don’t have children, you would have contributed many things to the lives of many people, more than you realise. Every time you do something as simple as saying something nice to someone, you leave a legacy in this world that will carry on. Your body will decompose and feed many organisms that will in turn live on and play their parts in the circle of life."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE Did anyone else view a person they saw with a facemask on a certain way and then when they finally saw them without it, see them differently?",Yeah some people have really attractive eyes.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE (USA) Think it's a huge waste of money and resources to have military fly overs before major Football games?,"From a cost perspective, these guys are going to clock hours anyway, so the fuel difference is net zero. They get a chance to train how to synchronize in time and space to achieve effects. From a military perspective, it's good training."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like the more advanced we become as a species, the higher the population of idiots becomes?","The more a society advances, the more specialized individuals become. We need to do more specific jobs that need a more specific skill set, rather than before when we needed to know all the general survival skills to carry on when we lived much simpler lives. I think education rates are growing, our jobs are refining and we know more as a collective species, but less as individuals because we don’t need to know as much to survive now, and this is a natural part of society formation IMO."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like to lie down on their back and traverse their place by sliding across the floor instead of walking when home alone and drunk/high/really tired?,No. This is insane. But I support all lifestyles so good for you.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE leave their stove light on 24/7 to serve as the kitchen night lite?,Nope. All lights off at bedtime. I ain’t runnin up the light bill while I’m unconscious.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think AI is going to make the internet suck?,"It already has 

Don't remember the last time Google took my wildcard search terms into account, gave me relevant results, or didn't fill the first 20-ish results with ads. r/TIHI 

The dead internet theory is closer every day"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE plan a whole productive day in their head and then do none of it?,"Yes. All the time. Took yesterday off so I could go to a better grocery store than my local one. Did not go out of town, but did get groceries local. I’m late in the day today as I’m building a freezer lasagna for my elderly parents. Past me has so much faith in now me. I’ve learned to just go with the flow and try not to beat myself up too much."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it's awesome to live alone near a swamp with almost no people around?,Found Shrek’s alt
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think negativity on Reddit is extremely toxic?,"Reddit is kind of like a mini internet, so it has many qualities. Sometimes it’s very enlightening and sometimes a good way to share a niche hobby or love of a particular game or show. Sometimes anonymity allows people to talk about things like sex in a way that is normally difficult. (And So. Much. Porn.) But sometimes conflict breeds engagement and it’s a snowball of detached people feeding each other’s dumbest, meanest, or most addictive qualities.

The most impressive good thing I’ve seen on Reddit was when r/fountainpens got an ink named after a user who sadly died of (I think) leukemia because he’d been posting updates about pens when he was receiving treatment. His gf gave the news that he died, the community was really sad, but found a company to make the ink and it’s proceeds help fund research. 

BUT: Reddit is not a great substitute for a therapist. Most people don’t know what to say when somebody starts talking about being suicidal, etc.

Also, Reddit puts out what you give in. If your posts are negative to begin with, it’s not going to foster something inspirational. For example, your post here is attracting a lot of banal “yeah social media is horrible, everyone’s a hypocrite” comments. Which sound a bit teenaged and oversimplified to me.

From you recent history, OP, it seems like a lot of what you do on Reddit is talk about really heavy mental health stuff or vent about things you don’t like. The former may get you limited advice because people aren’t experts and they don’t know how to help. The latter can sometimes be satisfying, but may also just attract more negativity, since that’s where your starting. I may not have the right impression, and I’m not trying to be intrusive, I just wanted to get a sense of where you were coming from. 

But my advice is 1) find subs that are about things you *do* like  2) limit your daily time on Reddit; reduce it by about 1/3 at least. If you are already depressed, social media of any kind can be like quicksand."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get weird moments when they suddenly notice they exist and that everything happening is real?,"It's just a side effect of the server you're on getting a new patch applied.  I wouldn't worry about it, it's a minor glitch and shouldn't cause any serious problems."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE start putting their pinkie out as a kid because Patrick said it was fancy, and still does it as an adult because it's become a habit?","Patrick, the OG influencer."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Shower with their glasses on?,this is the third or fourth funniest thing I've read today
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a hard time watching other people work when they dont use shortcuts on the keyboard or in the software.,I had to show someone that holding shift allows you to select multiple files at a time. I’m an engineer. So were they. I thought they were joking at first about not knowing that. 🤦🏻
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever put Bugles (the chips) on their fingers and pretend like they're a rich old lady talking to their friend Edna at an outdoors café during brunch?,"Yeah, EVERYONE"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not find conventionally attractive girls hot?,Just don’t ever ever EVER tell your partner you feel this way. It’s not a compliment to call someone “unconventionally attractive”
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not care about their own birthday?,"Yup, me too.  I also don’t really care about other people’s birthdays.  🫤"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have ""music cycles"" when listening to music?","Yes, I do the same thing. Right now I'm on a Moody Blues kick. A couple weeks ago it was Buena Vista Social Club. Before that it was Waylon Jennings."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like to randomly put their arm up in the air while in bed?,Ugh my husband puts his hand on his face while he is sleeping. Arm falls. Wakes himself up. Repeat another 20 times. It’s so aggravating
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE (female) not know how to hook their bra without looking?,That’s how my wife does it.  At least I’ve never seen her do it differently in the 20 years we’ve been married.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a uncontrollable urge to create something and then can't do shit.,"Every time I watch a crafting video on youtube or shop at a ""Michael's"" I get the craft urge. I have less than no talent. And even less patience to create something."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE only sleep soundly when there's a pillow to hug or squeeze between your legs,And a fan going
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE: Randomly get the urge to pee after you pee?,"I do.. kind of. I finish and get out of the toilet and then after maybe 5 min im like oh i need to pee again, but i just ignore that and it goes away soon after"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE stop watching movie franchises after two or three because it feels like they're just milking it?,"I feel like the fast and furious movies and a lot of the action ones that come out today are our equivalent to Bollywood movies.they are over the top, unrealistic shit happening all at once."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel completely repulsed by eating contests?,"    Tons of people don’t have enough food to eat

This was a lifeline for me at one point in time. I was homeless at 14, and was living in squats (didn't want to go into the foster system) while going to secondary school. If I hadn't eaten for a day or more, I could go to a place that did those 'eating challenges' where you get your food for free if you eat a certain amount in a time limit (and a photo on the wall). Even at 14, I was tall and wide, so never failed one of those challenges.

My ugly teenage mug was on a lot of London restaurant walls in the 00's."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that babies are really ugly?,"When first born, their placenta face-pack does them no favours, but many babies grow to be cute.


You must however say all babies look lovely to their parents. It's the law."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE notice people insult others with things that are true about themselves,People who insult others are often insecure. They think that putting others down props them up
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE prefer room temperature beverages over cold beverages?,Yes. My wife thinks I’m a serial killer at the loading screen because of it
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE look forward to mornings specifically because that’s coffee time?,Cuz I can have my oats that I love so much
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE experience this weird adult “homesickness”?,It can feel that way where you’re experiencing major life changes .
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wish they spoke fluent Spanish?,I live in an area that borders a Hispanic area. Ive heard “gringo” while I’ve been shopping twice and I’m glad I don’t understand because ya boy is sensitive these days :(
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE sometimes suddenly have a period of very high energy and concentration that lasts a few hours, and after it ends you have very low energy and concentration and a headache for a few hours?","I have ADHD. There is no other types of energy lmao. 90% of the time it's depression, 10% of the time it's HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA RIENRIEJEJEJER THIS IS AMAZINGJEIENRIEEJRINDIWNEEJJEJEURHFHRJDFJRJDJRURRJRJFURJRJFFNDNRNRNRJEJR"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE still miss cigarettes even though a significant amount of time has passed since you have quit?,10 years I smoked a pack a day. 10 years I have not had one. If I found out I am dying tomorrow.. I am driving to the store buying them and smoking until I am gone.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like a retired child rather than an adult?,I JUST got a job for the first time at the age of 26 and I just feel like I’m playing dress-up quite honestly. I feel like I don’t have any business being an adult.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the neck of their shirt makes them feel claustrophobic?,"OMG yes! Not just the neck, but the whole shirt. 

That is why I only buy clothes that are 2 sizes bigger than my actual size."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE talk to themselves? Like a lot?,I'm doing the same thing but I'm becoming worried about it because sometimes I can do it a lot. I will just imagine a conversation with someone in my head and I will answer out loud like the person is really here
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE need to jerk off 3-4 times a day to relieve stress?,"I went through a period where I was not too different from that. 

It's definitely a bit of an outlier at that frequency. I was abnormally high, but still a little lower than that, more like masturbation twice a day morning and night, with occasional bathroom jerk sessions on stressful days. Sex was usually one or two times and I was done. But, if it's not causing him to withdraw from sex with you (which it kinda sounds like the opposite) and he has found a system that works for him that's totally healthy.

Sex drives vary a lot from person to person, but the male sex drive between puberty and 30 can be REALLY intense and it's definitely not a good idea to try to shame or suppress it into something less. 

I'm guessing he's younger than 25?

Things for me definitely slowed down a lot between 25-35."
DoesAnybodyElse,IAE embarrassed of their music taste?,"I'm a musician and a guitar teacher. Like the music and fuck the people who put you down for it. I'm old and I like rap, people my age don't like it. So what...Get over it. The truth is most people don't pay much attention to what you listen to and if they do, it just shows they are not as intelligent as they think they are. And maybe more insecure as well."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they’re always an outsider no matter the group?,"Yes, absolutely. In fact, I've always felt alone thinking I was the only one who could never fit in anywhere. Glad I'm not alone in this, at least."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they're incredibly uninteresting?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE hear a high-pitched sound in their ears when nothing nearby seems to make it?,Tinnitus.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have the urge to abandon their life in a developed society and move to some uninhabited island,I do but then I remember that it would be really hard to survive. I'd be one injury from starvation or one bad meal from dysentery.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like their life is pretty much over?,I have more years behind me than ahead of me. One of my two sons died last year. My other son has a son of his own. If it weren’t for them I wouldn’t have a reason to get up every day.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE refuse to watch a video if you get a long ad or 2 ads?,Oh dude the moment there's a hint of an ad I'm out lol
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think people should NOT be allowed to take their shoes off in public spaces (gyms, classrooms, movies, etc.)?",But I don’t want soggy trainers when I go to the pool 😔
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE laugh when they get a “A concerned Redditor has reached out” message from Reddit?,It's the third-level downvote.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE genuinely enjoy not working?,"I *love* not working, it’s kinda my thing, then again I am a McFlurry machine"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE always throw away the first square of toilet paper in public toilets?,Honestly I've never thought to do this but now it's permanently etched into my brain.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE hear their heartbeat in their ears ? I have irregular heart rhythm and I can’t bear hearing it especially at night when I’m trying to sleep…but the Doc looked at me like I was mad when I mentioned it…,"Pulsatile tinnitus. I used to have it, but it resolved on its own. I'm a little surprised that your doctor didn't pick up on that."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE need to feel the same thing on both sides of their body?,"Could be OCD, im not properly diagnosed cause I havent been able to get in contact with a psychiatrist, but a doctor once said he thinks I have it and I do too, ive got similar symptoms to that."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE use toilet paper as tissues like Kleenex?,"Day to day, sure, but if I'm sick absolutely not. I need Kleenex with Aloe and Vit E, or Puffs Plus with lotion. I've had way to many Raw noses while sick to even bother with anything but the good tissues. 

I never grew up with tissues or Napkins, I'm not sold on napkins unless it's a ""nice meal"" but tissues are necessary thing in my home, but I'm not above using toilet paperm"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE listen to music, audiobooks, or podcasts to block out the shitty thoughts inside?",Yep. Except I use them when trying to sleep. My mind tends to wander to dark places. I try to keep them positive.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a yearly “war” with fruit flies?,"I work in a bar, so yes! Good tip for at home, leave a shot glass of wine out where they’re most annoying, they’ll go for the wine and drown themselves."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE hump their boyfriend,"Yes I also find it hilarious for some reason. I try to get him to admit he’s impressed by my thrust skills, but he is yet to confess."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE read Florida Man headlines and pretend it's the same guy doing every ridiculous thing?,It’s always De Santis
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE report the “He Gets Us” Reddit promoted posts as offensive?,"If you downvote it, you see it even more often."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a pervasive feeling that they are not “living” but just waiting for their life to begin?,"I have felt that way off and on my whole life. I used to refer to it as “camping out”. Not really home, if that makes sense. Now that I’m older I realize that life is what you make it. There aren’t any rules. There are so many choices you can make. The hard part is being ok with the choices you do make. Nobody says you have to see the world. If you’re happy staying in your little nook, that’s ok too."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wish they had a best friend again?,"35 here. I haven't had a best friend since highschool. 

I do really miss having a buddy to hang out with. Nowadays I try making friends but it seems as if everyone is too busy or uninterested."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like they faked their way through school and university, and now that they have a job, it's difficult to actually work hard?","I can relate, and I second the advice to find something you love. School was “easy” to get good grades because I generally liked school. My job now is hard because it’s monetizing my intelligence to do things I don’t personally care about."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel empathy for inanimate objects?,"Yes, ever since I was a little kid lol"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else sometimes forget what year is it? (no joke),"No, but I do remember 2019 like it was just yesterday and have simultaneously erased most of 2020 out my mind."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not have any close friends and figure they probably never will?,I have my husband. We occasionally hang out with his friends. Most of the friends I had growing up either moved away or we went on different life paths. Plus I am super introverted/socially anxious. I don’t have a lot in common with anyone.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think tipping culture is getting out of hand?,Everyone thinks this.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE enjoy being in a parked car in the rain?,"Absolutely, rain makes just about everything better! Not to mention, that being in a parked car in the rain is even better when you’re steaming up the windows with somebody."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have those moments where in a group or 3 + people conversation you are not even looked at or spoken to. And when you say something you either get ignored or people stare at you like you broke a script?,"Yes. It’s also why in a group setting if I’m actively engaging in a convo, I try to get everyone involved at some point so others don’t feel left out. It’s a terrible feeling when it seems like you aren’t welcome to shoot the shit with everyone else."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE randomly wonder how would people react to my death?,"I remember in year 10, a girl in my science class suddenly passed away during the summer holidays. They wanted to tell us when we returned as yesr 11's. This girl was relatively quiet, nice, and kind. She always kept to herself, and I wasn't sure if she had any friends in our year. But I remember when the news hit in assembly, everyone remembered her. Like even the ones that never spoke to her remembered her. They remembered her kindness, her quietness, the way she smiled, everything, yet they never spoke to her. 
It made me realise that although we do not know what impact we have in the lives of others , once we pass, everyone will have some memory of us. Whether it be our smile, our voice, our kindness, the way we sat... whatever, they will remember."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like Trump and his co-conspirators won't spend a day in prison?,Some of the co-conspirators - maybe.  Trump - nope.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think oven baked is worth the wait over the speed of the microwave?,"Yes. Thank god for the air fryer. I can bake without preheating!

Edit: pizza rolls are actually really good in the air fryer. I didn’t know they could be so delicious."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE randomly get grossed out/nauseous by what they’re eating ?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Forget someone's name by the end of the conversation?,"99% of the time when someone intruduces another person to me or i just met the person, i will not even forget, i will literally not retain their names, unless i hear other people calling them a bunch of times, i will not know, sometimes their faces too. Is just strange because i have a very good photographic and hearing memory, but unless its practiced i wont retain."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feels apathetic to a lot of things? Including problems in society/society itself?,"I vote - but everything I can’t actually change I just don’t trouble myself over any longer. I take care of my circles (family, friends, even friends of friends) and help out where I can (send people a fiver or tenner on here for example) but that’s that. 

I need to reserve my mental energy for where I can make a tangible difference."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just dread returning to work after the holidays?,I dread returning to work each and every day I have to return to work.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE set their phone down for a bit when a long, unskippable ad comes on so that they don't have to see it?","I set it aside forget to add ignore the ad and hate them intensely while I stare at the screen.

I will never buy your product now"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE keep their phone in do not disturb mode 24/7?,"Yes, but I have my husband on emergency bypass because we text throughout the day about mundane things like what we want for dinner or plans for the night. Everyone else is on silent and do not disturb. Too much sensory overload otherwise!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get depressed when looking at old photos?,"I've struggled with those emotions for many years.  For example, I cannot reread letters my husband sent me when he was deployed.  I cannot read the diary he kept while he was deployed.  I cannot drive past my childhood home, look at photos or watch old videos.  I would get upset for days.  So, I do not look back.  Do whatever works best for your well being.  🫶"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the powerball lotto should change their odds of winning so that more people win smaller jackpots? I mean 2.04 BILLION dollars for one person is asinine.,"Larger jackpots drive sales.

The odds of winning were less difficult years ago. However, winning a few million, although life changing, didn't draw the same amount of hype. By making it harder to win, and increasing the jackpot with each subsequent drawing that results in no winner, people became more aware of it, and sales increase. People who do not traditionally gamble or play the lottery go out and buy tickets. It's still an infinitesimally small chance of winning - but the reward is far greater."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else find modern interiors boring and uninspired,"They can be done well. I really appreciate the lack of visual ""noise"" that tends to come with modern interiors. Though, I much prefer warm modern over some of the more sterile, ""fancy office lobby"" type moderns out there.

^(Edit: fixed format freakout.)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sit around doing nothing all weekend and then regret it on Monday morning?,Quite the opposite. I feel I've wasted my weekend if I'm productive.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like everything they do feels like a chore?,If TV feels like a chore it's depression.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE worry they don’t react sad enough to tragic things happening to them and worry it makes them look like a psychopath?,"Hundred percent, I have a cousin who died, she was murdered in a drive by, and it’s very sad yes but I don’t know I didn’t really cry or feel much other than kind of bewildered that I’d never see her again… I also just found the whole thing eerily sad and less devastating then I think I should’ve found it."

DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE immediately crack up and think of South park when a ""tough"" biker pulls up by you at a light?",Fags!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like crying when they see an older person with a slouched back still working a physical job?,"I am 70, just retired after working 52 years.  As a cashier what choked me up was seeing some of my older customers  as they struggled with fingers twisted and swollen with rheumatoid arthritis.  I had some problems with stiffness, but most of that has disappeared since I am away from that store.  I still think about my elderly customers and wonder how they are doing."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want to go back to the 1980's and leave 2023?,And have all the shit that went down between them and now to go through again? Well I did get more sex in the eighties.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE struggle to post to showerthoughts because they always fuck up the wording and get an automated mod response?,"Tried to post there one time, several years ago.  The automod removed my post for some stupid reason.  Never posted there again and unsubscribed.  I don’t miss it at all."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE worry about retirement? I'm 34 and have little savings.,"Also 34, zero savings.  So far my retirement plans include dying."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE like to sleep in a cold room, bundled up under a lot of blankets with just their feet sticking out?","Yes to all apart from my feet sticking out. I may be an adult but the monster under my bed could still get me, and I don’t like having cold feet."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get really horny when angry?,Quite a Dangerous combination you got there 😅😅
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get creeped out when a random vehicle parks in front of your house, sits there for a few minutes and then drives off?","Definitely. Though one time I caught someone smoking a bowl, so that’s one reason."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feels it's impossible to take a quick shower even when you're rushing?,"Yup! If I have to choose between no shower, or a shower less than ten minutes, I will choose no shower. I realize this is crazy but if I go into the shower thinking “it will only be 5 minutes “ THEN I AM LYING TO MYSELF."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE skip videos that say ""wait until the end""?",Yes I’ve been betrayed one to many times
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else have associations with unrelated things, such as colours to certain numbers/months of the year?","There's that meme where it says something like ""6pm, 7x7=49 and Thursday all have the same energy"" and tons of people agreed. I disagree because 6pm is green, but yeah 7x7=49 and Thursday are related to October just because they're all orange.

I sound totally deranged but if you know, you know I guess"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not enjoy being around people for extended periods of time?,Yes.  I got about an hour of social time before I just want to be home.  People are exhausting.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Not care if there is a hair in your food?,"FINALLY. my bf and i have talked about this before. of course if it’s my own hair i don’t care. when going out to eat and i find a hair in my food, i recognize that it’s gross but i honestly would rather just pick it out and keep eating instead of sending it back 😭. i know it’s gross, it just doesn’t bother me THAT much. like dropping a chip on the floor (in a not high traffic/shoe area). yeah it’s gross but if i want it i’m gonna eat it. idk why i think this but when this happens i always think “if i was stranded on an island and the only food available had a hair in it, i would 100% eat it” and that’s my logic/excuse for being gross"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not feel hungry in the morning,Yes. I usually wake up nauseous at the thought of food.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel scared they are being nice to people just to get them to like you but inside think you are are very bad person?,"If the only reason someone is nice to me is because they want me to like them that’s fine. I get it, people need to be liked. If they secretly want something from me and are trying to get me to lower my guard that’s a problem."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE consistently fart as loud as possible when alone?,No. It wouldn’t be right for me to deprive my wife of my precious gasses.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE know they're loved but have a hard time feeling they're loved?,"Yes, it feels like the love never gets in, as if my body can't connect to it. I assume it's from emotional neglect during childhood. I know people genuinely love me, but I can't feel it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE start to lose interest in something after joining a subreddit for that thing?,"That, or everyone is complaining about the thing I love and it makes me feel bad."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE talk to their pets like they are human?,My dog and I were just talking about this last night.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel anxious about ever posting anything on Reddit because of a fear of being recognised by someone IRL?,"No.

If I want to? I write something and make sure it is always unrecognizable as something that happened to me, personally.

No one knows my user name (except for my husband).

And? People come from all over the world to either give advice or receive advice on Reddit.

There's nothing wrong with that."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sometimes rather watch paint dry than to get up and do anything productive /go to work?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like to eat cake with milk?,"I can't say I mix both iny mouth at once unless the cake is woefully dry. Ha

I do however like a nice glass of milk to drink between bites in the same way I like a soda with my dinner."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like they're always having to play a character when they're in social situations, and are only their true selves when alone?","Yup, all the time. People must think I’m antisocial, but I’m not. Just worn down by playing the game. Alone time is recharge time, enjoy it without guilt."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a hard time hearing their alarms in the morning? 😬,"Drink a bottle of water prior to going to bed. If you get up through the night to pee, drink another bottle of water before laying back down. 
Potty training is one of those things that are so deeply ingrained in our psychi, almost nothing can defeat it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get irrationally angry when shopping with their mother?,"YES! I don't know why, but after a bit it just pisses me off. she has to go down every. single. Isle. and look at every item. a store trip that should've taken 3-5 minutes takes 45-60 minutes."
DoesAnybodyElse,"WAE as a child really concerned about the Bermuda triangle, like ""hey, why is nobody doing anything about it? what if it sucks us in?""",Yes and I blame Unsolved Mysteries for it!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want to go off the grid and prioritize self-care?,Do it. I've done it more than once in the past. Sometimes you need to just pull all connections and reside into yourself Somewhere Out of Sight
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE enjoy those cattle hoof trimming and cleaning videos?,I watch the hoof gp
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE leave their shoes tied when taking them off,"i typically tie my shoes once, when first getting them."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get hungry after masterbation or intercourse?,I just get super sleepy. Like I close my eyes while cumming and I'm just so fucking sleepy after I'm done. That's usually with masturbation but if I'm with someone they need give me a minute to come back to normal. I usually just take a short nap then eat some snacks after.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Wish cancel culture was dead,Wow you’re trying to cancel cancel culture?
DoesAnybodyElse,dae feel like they cant connect with people,"Yeah, this hit pretty close to home.

We should hang out in awkward silence some time."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE put salt on their watermelon or in their lemonade?,Come to India. Order a fresh lime soda (sweet + salt). Get mindblown.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find it really, REALLY annoying when someone looks at your screen without asking? Computer, tablet, phone, etc?","I have nothing to hide, but yesterday my teen decided to scroll thru my phone for no reason other than it was on the counter.  I was very uncomfortable ."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like therapy isn't helping them?,"As a therapist, sometimes I think this is just a mismatch of worldviews. Example, personally, I dislike having a therapist who works from behavioral perspectives as that focuses on a short term approach, and unfortunately it is super popular right now. I prefer psychotherapy or socially oriented approaches. So try a few different people, look up their profiles on psychology today, and ask them what is their therapeutic perspective."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not remember their milestones?,"Yeah, my entire personal history is a blur.  I have a terrible memory… it’s a little scary honestly"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE randomly feel really disconnected while talking to people,"Disassociation, perhaps?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE pull their wife's / SO's hairs out of their own ass?,"Yes, this is the norm for some of us. I don't know why, I just know that it happens 🤷‍♀️"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE talk to themselves all the time?,"My partner says he hears me talk to my self all the time.  In my defence I was probably talking to the tv, or the toaster"

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have kids that are way cooler than they ever were as a kid?,"My kids would say things like, ""I'm gonna be taller than you, dad.  I'm goona beat you at basketball one day, dad....ect,ect.""


I had the same conversation with all of them, but one at a time, and when it was time.


I said, ""My greatest accomplishment will be seeing you surpass me in everything I've ever done.  I want you to be better than me in every way.  A better student.  A better friend.  A better ball player.  A better fighter.  A better partner.  I just hope you never have to say that you'll be a better dad than I was."""
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Think burning man just looks like a bunch of posers covered in dust?,"In today's world, it looks like an expensive gathering for privileged people."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else go about their lives waiting to be in trouble for something?,"Are you me? I spend my days walking on egg shells waiting to get in trouble. Also on anxiety and depression medicine. Currently there is a feeling in the air at work, I’m waiting for something to happen."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE watch porn without your significant other knowing?,You guys think we don’t know but we do 😁
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not want to have a long term future?,"My Dad passed at 76 last March (2022). I remember him telling me once, “the golden years ain’t so golden”. I believe him. I’ve worked in healthcare extensively and seen what time does. It’s sad and scary. I’m also a few weeks away from 40 now and I question my own mortality more than I use to."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE experience overwhelming feelings of cringe and embarrassment whenever they remember having made a simple mistake in front of others?,"Speaking as a middle-aged old fart, I have good news and bad news for you:

Good news: most of the crystal clear cringe moments you now have embedded in your brain will eventually fade from memory.

Bad news: they will fade because they've been replaced by even-more-cringy incidents and regrets for actions both taken and not taken.

Good news: as you get older, you general care less about the cringe because you understand everyone had them and most other people don't remember yours the next day."
DoesAnybodyElse,IAE completely mindblown by how many people take sport seriously?,"I mean I get it but more in a friendly competitive way. What I don't get is getting so mad you destroy the TV or take it out on others.

I had a roommate who was a Viking fan... needless to say he broke shit every weekend it seemed like. Of course I was ""slightly"" antagonistic because I pointed out they always lose."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE instinctively say something like “come again?” or “what’s that?”, immediately after someone asks you something/talks to you unexpectedly, even though you heard them perfectly fine?","I do generally have to take a moment to process what people are saying, and my default is to say ""...do what?"" (which is apparently kind of a hillbilly phrase) I've been told I'm rude for this and that I'm a bad listener but it's really just my brain and it's faulty wiring hearing most things wrong. 
I tend to feel super dumb when I ask someone to repeat what they said but I understand just fine. Kind of like when you bump into something and say ""ow"" even though it didn't hurt."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think bad parenting when they see a child in a stroller with their eyes glued to a smart phone?,"Parents can't catch a break. 

In a society where 2 incomes isn't enough most of the time, and many kids are in school/childcare for longer than an average workweek. 

In a society where we are told it takes a village, only to find the village doesn't exist anymore for most of us. 

In a society where we're all exhausted and doing our best.

Can we please just give parents some slack? You have NO idea how they parent outside of that brief moment in time you choose to judge their parenting."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE notice that Oreo filling is getting thinner and thinner?,I noticed this as well. Shrinkflation.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE actually like being downvoted sometimes, especially when they know that they're right and they struck a nerve w the ppl downvoting them?",I try to upvote people who have been downvoted for what seems like no reason. I personally don’t like being downvoted but there are times where I stand my ground and eat it.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE not care ""specifically"" about their friends' children?","This is not about caring about the kids of your friends, it's about meeting someone who is important to your friend - kind of like a boyfriend or husband. 

If the friend asked you if you wanted to stay to meet her new partner you haven't been introduced to yet - would you have had the same reaction? Would you have been confused as well? I guess not. 

Her second child was also recently born - she is a proud new momma and you didn't care to meet her child? Did you ask about her family at all? What DID you talk about?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the schedule blackout protest tomorrow on Reddit will have minimal effect,Completely disagree. It’s going to have *no* effect.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get really disturbed when people think politicians care about them?,"Are there even that many people who think this way?

It honestly doesn't matter at all if a politician ""cares"" about you or not. You're not supposed to vote for someone because you want them to be your friend, you vote for them to represent your interests. Whether they ""care"" about those interests isn't important, it's a transactional relationship.

Politician wants votes, constituents want X, politician does X in exchange for votes.

Never in that equation is it actually important if the politician gives a shit about X themselves.

The problem comes from the fact that just because that's how it should work in theory doesn't mean that's how it works in practice and instead politicians only answer to corporations and the wealthy."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE talk to someone else in their head rather than to yourself?,I imagine talking to a fictional character. :‘)
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get physically uncomfortable watching a TV or film scene where a genuinely nice person gets humiliated in a social situation?,"Absolutely. 
I did some reading on this and it’s kind of cool why this happens!
As humans, we have a unique network in our brains specifically built to reward us for good perceived social behaviors and punish us for perceives bad ones (I forget the name of it, I’ll look it up again and update this if you’d like). Having a strong and reliable social network was crucial for our survival during our evolutionary development, so being ostracized could’ve been deadly. This is why we have this unique network; to prevent us from being ostracized.
So if we get attached to a character and they go through something like that, physical discomfort isn’t uncommon at all. When I see this happen, I sometimes have to pause the movie or episode and get a stim toy to play with to relax."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE, during a super stressful situation, only break down and cry after someone shows you a moment of kindness?","I get angry, sad to admit like Hulk rage angry. 

Once I was there due to a piece of shit family member, my wife came and hugged me, I fuckin broke.

6'2 260 lb angry dude and my 5' wife just calmly walked up and held me. 

I've never cried like I did then. 

Sorry long answer, yea I too op have done that."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that plastic surgery looks ugly or just plain weird?,Bad plastic surgery looks ugly or weird - you don’t notice the good ones
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not enjoy being lonely but find it more troublesome to keep and maintain friends?,"Sadly, yes?

I feel lonely all the time.

But I tried to make a friend recently and the relationship expectations are just too exhausting it turns out"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they are surrounded by overpaid incompetent people at work?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get so anxious and overwhelmed that you often feel like crying yet you can’t for some reason?,"Yeah.

Usually when I’m at least a little fatigued, combined with the splendidly overthinking and a cocktail of the rational feeling of needing to be strong for the next workload to come in the next few days, even weeks.

A fatal conflict, which results in somewhat of a self-blocked/self-stunned state of mind (or being) in which I feel somehow paralyzed.

Anxiety at its best, yay."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just straight up drink pickle juice?,I did when I was a kid my brother and I enjoyed it. It's supposed to be good for a hangover also
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wake up with a random song in their head?,All the time. I have music in my dreams as well.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE used to be the friendly, open, childhood genius up until age 11 when the worst depression imaginable hit you like a bullet and you’ve never been the same again?",Yes. Turns out I had ADHD and was never diagnosed correctly until now.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE always check a million times the time you have to arrive somewhere?,"In this scenario I use my alarm to let me know when to start getting ready, or at least when to tell me the time is getting critical. Usually will set it right up to an hour or hour and a half before I have to leave. It's really effective!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not imagine it being possible that someone could have a crush on you?,"Oh yeah.  And if someone ever did say they like me, I'm going to assume it's a cruel joke.  I could get married and still half expect them to suddenly go ""Ha ha, just kidding loser.  I can't believe you thought someone actually liked you."""
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE: ever have gotten into heated debates with someone only to find out you agreed the whole time and the debate only happened because you didn’t realize y’all were discussing entirely different things?,"Talking is a skill, but so is listening."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE take lots of notes and screenshots to remember things but its hard to organize and you probably don’t look at them again?,I bought a white board and put it up near the stairs that I have to use to get down to the garage where my truck is.  Anything I really have to remember is written down on that.  Its hard to miss.
DoesAnybodyElse,Has anybody else experienced a better sex life after stopping hormone birth control?,"I just stopped a few weeks ago because my anxiety and depression were uncontrollable. I knew stopping would ease all of that, but I was shocked at how it affected my sex drive. Things are freaking exciting again! Downside= condoms, but what a difference in libido."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not understand why Billie Eilish is such a huge sensation,"A few reasons, 

- Music and lyrics. She and her brother Finneas are writing and producing some of the most interesting music right now. That's not just my opinion but the opinion of a lot well respected artists in the industry. Thom Yorke, Dave Grohl, Damon Albarn, Adele, Donald Glover, Chris Martin, Missy Elliott all admire her work. I think if you delved into her music a lot more you'd understand. Bad Guy and Ocean eyes aren't a really good representation of her work. 

- Anti popstar persona - People admire her because she doesn't sexualise herself or feel the need to be cute to sell her music. 

- Likeability- I've never met her but from interviews I've seen of her, she seems very down to earth"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get random intrusive thoughts? Like sometimes I just think about hurting people that I genuinely like even though I would never actually do it. Sometimes I scare myself,yes that's perfectly normal
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find the smell of fabric softener nauseating,"I just dislike overpowering smells in general. Like all you need is a little bit but if that's all I can smell when you get close to me back the fuck up and cool it with the scent.

The stronger the scent the worse you smell. You don't smell clean you just smell like chemical. Clean doesn't actually have a smell, it's the absence of smell. We just like to send things because we're crazy."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever get mildly entertained watching your eye floaters?,Me! I remember as a kid not knowing if they were in my eyes or in the sky. I’d look towards the sky and “flick” my eyes back and forth to make them dance.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE need an irrational amount of time to mentally prep for simple tasks/obligations?,"I spend all week preparing for a phone call then miss my chance and plan the best time to call again then worry and keep procrastinating and worrying and some tasks I am embarrassed at how long I've put them off. One of them being finding another dentist when I was scratched off for missing appointments. It's been at least a decade now.

Calling in sick on the day is the most stressful thing I could have to do, anxiety goes through the roof in addition to feeling unwell.

Preparing to tidy my room takes months.

I even have to prepare myself to shower, it feels like such a chore.

Irrational is an understatement."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Tear Up to Really Good Music?,Yes!! What’s worse is I’ll be singing a song I really connect to but I can’t because one verse in and I’m sobbing. True story.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE talk to themselves pretending that they’re being interviewed for a talk show or podcast?,I do it to practice my story telling skills or to flesh out my opinion on an issue.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like throwing up if they get too hungry?,"Yes. I'm the same way and I've mentioned it to people too and they said they haven't experienced it. If I get too hungry I'm almost certain to puke, especially in the morning. Then I force myself to eat and try not to throw up and within 15 ish mins of eating I feel better."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE write up entire, potentially multi-paragraph posts, only to end up deleting them?","Absolutely. All of the time. For the same reason, too. Nothing weird about that to me. Helps me get the thoughts organized and out of my head to write it out. Then, I realize that no one cares what I think and most people are just here to pick fights so, it's just self harm to voice my opinion here. Why ask people to kick me when I am probably already down?"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find Sam smith’s song, Unholy, absolutely painful to listen to?",Absolutely corporate garbage music
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE drink cold milk with whipped cream, and sprinkles?","I worked for Starbucks for 5 years, and I can tell you that many many people start off every morning with a cup of cold milk with whipped cream and sprinkles.  They just add blended ice, syrup, and call it a Frappuccino.

Never let anyone make you feel bad about your Party Milk"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not care about the dreaded age gap?,"Idc about age gap if both are above 25. You're 25 dating 50 year old , fine. I do find it weird when 45 year olds date 18 year olds. Dude my dad is younger than 45. But all I can do is finding it weird. I can't stop you, the law doesn't stop you."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE religiously cut up 6 pack containers before getting rid of them?,Yes I do and that’s why seabirds love and respect me.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not give a crap about St. Patrick's Day?,"As a sober alcoholic i spend the day(s) hiding, eating junk food, and watching movies. It's dog's fourth of July for me."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like you just want to stop existing..?,"Yes. I was literally thinking about this today. Like, I'm not suicidal but I'm just tired of being here."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think Royal Nobility is absurd?,It's an outdated system. I like these titles in terms of fantasy or in historical context but I don't think they really have a place in today's society.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not listen to music lyrics,"Why does this have to be a disorder to be diagnosed? Just enjoy your music! If you ignore the lyrics, then just go forth and ignore the lyrics (half the time, even if you can make them out, lyrics don’t make sense anyway). 

Some people ignore the sound of the bass. The bass, to them,  is just an instrument playing in the background, but it’s nothing worth diagnosing as a “disorder.” Maybe you hear the lyrics the same way they hear the bass line. It all depends on what layer of the music you’re focusing on. 

Just enjoy your music. Whatever that means to you is the way you should do it. 🎶🤔🎶"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE associate certain songs with moments of their life? Like when you hear the song after a long time you are taken back to the very specific moment you associate it with and start visualising the moment for a while like in a virtual reality headset ?,Yep. And it's ruined some really great songs because they're now associated with jerks.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE save the best bite of every meal for the last bite?,"Okay, I'm not alone! My friends make fun of me for eating my fries *before* the burger. I eat the arroz y frijoles *before* the enchipotladas. I eat the Caesar salad and loaded mashed potatoes *before* the porterhouse. When I eat the porterhouse, I'm sure you can guess which cut I eat last. (I'm not a heathen. Yes, I eat it rare. Blue if it's a good steakhouse. If it's not still mooing when it gets to the table, it's overcooked)

How am i the weird one!? Of fucking course I want the best part last!"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE among fat/obese people, feel very uncomfortable eating with people, and look for any excuse to be eating alone?","Yes, definitely, I have felt those same feelings. 

If you were bullied about being overweight, and bullied directly while you were eating food, and finding it affecting you in your every day life, you might consider PTSD. Especially if it happened many times so that now you have consistently bad memories and feelings associated with eating around others (and even eating in general)."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get the feeling that this is not real from time to time?,That has been happening to me lately and I think it's related to anxiety. My stress levels have been off the charts lately
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not comment on a post because it already has many comments?,"Yes.  And I hate it when (I think) I have a great comment to add, only to see the post is 12 hours old and has 2k comments and my comment will never be seen."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE upvote a post just because, say, they have 199 votes, and you vote just to make it, like, an even 200? And hence more order in the universe, or am I just an OCD freak?","No, I will downvote just to make it uneven if it’s at 200.  I will upvote if it’s at 665 though because I love chaos."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE in the US want their portion of government cheese?,I would take your share then. I have had government cheese before and its great.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else eat cereal at night?,Cereal is for any time of the day! Makes a great dessert
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find most modern TV to be very boring?,"Netflix calls it ""second screen content"". It's designed to be unintrusive while you are constantly scanning your first screen, your smartphone."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE Think that ""elbow grease"" was a real product as a kid?","I'll never forget when my Aunt told my friend who offered to help her clean (he had a crush on her) to grab the elbow grease and headlight fluid from the basement.

Dinner came and we assumed he went home without saying anything then comes up and says he couldn't find them.
After a moment of silence everyone was laughing but him."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Think Crypto is stupid and most of it is pointless?,All I’ll say is that many people who are super into it are also super insufferable.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE subconsciously assume people's gender on the internet?,"Unless proven otherwise, I assume everyone is an American man, despite me being neither."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find it strange that we come to REDDIT to feel understood from people we don’t know, rather than seek to be understood by our actual friends and family?","I come to Reddit to get downvoted by strangers for having reasonable opinions. 😂

But seriously, I don't think it's strange to seek out likemindedness online if people around you just seem to be different to you. We all look for people and communities to feel accepted and the internet gives us much more chance to find them."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feels like nobody else listen to what you have to say?,Yeah. No one cares what anyone is saying. Just keep saying. That's what everyone else does.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think AI Art is NOT art?,"""But is it Art?"" is a question the Art world has asked since the emergence of abstraction. The definition of art became an artistic subject in and of itself--ceci n'est pas un pipe. The fact that this question is now being asked of AI-sourced art is, for me, evidence of its completely fitting and appropriate place in the history of art. 

Now, regarding the specifics of your view on creativity here, you should understand that thinking of it like ""AI-produced art"" isn't really accurate.

AI can't produce anything on its own. It's prompted by a human to do anything it does.

And *that's* where the creativity comes in. A human writes the prompt, and submits it in this magical tool, and out comes... something. And that something might very well be a completely new idea, *based on the human prompter's creativity*.

Generative AI only knows about concepts it's been trained on, but it is absolutely capable of combining those concepts in novel ways. Want to see a WalMart wearing underpants? It can do that. 

But it doesn't come up with those combinations on its own, it has to be prompted by human creativity. The AI is just a bigger, badder paintbrush.

Also, *good* AI art takes WAY more work than people realize. It's trivially simple to make *something*, but making something *good* takes a lot of steps and work."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not want to watch new movies and tv shows (even the ones you're excited for) besause they are being advertised so aggressively?,"Sometimes it gets to the point where I seen so many clips on adverts that I start to think I already saw the show when it finally comes on, so I skip it."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else immediately delete comments and posts when they get downvoted?,"I only delete them if I get a large concentration of assholes replying and I'm sick of the notifications. I don't really care about being downvoted, I just don't have any patience for people trying to argue."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like sitting or laying with their hand chilling in their pants?,"Are you by chance Al Bundy, star football player for polk high who once scored 4 touchdowns in a single game?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feels like people shouldn't be shamed about not leaving a tip?,Employers should be shamed for not paying their employees
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have these weird situations where they are doing literally nothing and all of a sudden bad memories are on replay in their minds?,"I do. It usually happens if I'm doing something where my mind can wander a bit, like trying to sleep, crocheting, or playing a low-stakes video game. I'll think back to things I did wrong, times I was embarrassed in public, or bad things that have happened in my life or people have done to me.

In my case, I think this is caused by my generalized and social anxiety, but I don't necessarily think that someone who thinks back on bad memories is mentally ill. However, if it's really distressing, traumatic, and/or disruptive of your day, I'd say to try to get professional help or look into coping methods."

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel hopeless about every aspect of life?,mid twenties is a really tough time.  i don’t know why people say “but you’re in the prime of your life”.  i was depressed af.   keep going.  focus on your health and trying to be happy and just keep going and it will settle down
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get unreasonably angry with sound,Sounds like a sensory issue.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel Reddit’s content display algorithm seems to have shifted to fear- and anger-based engagement in the last few years?,"No, not for me. I just get recommended memes and video game content."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they can't understand something unless they know every detail?,"I'm like this too otherwise it's a constant ""what if"" scenario playing in my mind.  I have to know the answers to all the ""what ifs"" before I feel like I truly know something."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the entire vibe of the year changes once fall hits? Usually for the better.,I always fall in love with fall ♥️
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else look for wild names in the movie credits…,"I like to look for the longest, most unpronounceable last names"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE keep getting these random followers that have NSFW profile pics? And there account has like NOTHING on it? Are these scams?,Ya I changed my settings so that no one can follow me and that fixed it. Not like I need followers on here anyway
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE love the amazing feeling of cleaning their ears with Q tips, despite warnings that Q tips can be harmful?","As much as the Q-tip company pretends to deny it… they and we all know why we really buy them. 

Gotta love getting that gunk out of your ear and the sensation is great too."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE keep all their old phones and don’t change anything in them?,"Never know when you might need a phone that only keeps a charge for 30 minutes or with a severly cracked screen.

My grandkids will find not only artifacts, but also a lot of sexy selfies of g-ma."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE involuntarily hold their pee in the entire night?,Tell me you’re under 30 without doing so
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it's weird when parents name their child after where they were conceived?,"People do this?!?

Hey come meet my daughter, Subaru Outback Backseat."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not have tattoos? Seems more popular to have them nowadays.,"Not got any.. I enjoy the art and appreciate good tattoos but I know I would get bored of any design on my own body and live to regret it ..

This is what stops me from considering getting any.."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get suddenly aware that you’re getting old like you think you’re 20 but then remember “holy shit, I’m 40”?","I'm just starting to feel like an adult at 30 years old. Unfortunately, I'll be 60 in a couple weeks..."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel sad, confused, and anxious after waking up from a nap?",I fucking hate naps for this reason.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever feel sad after meeting the girl or boy of your dreams... in your dreams... then waking up to find that person doesn't really exist?,"Yes, or having a dream you’re back together with an old ex from years ago and you were so happy then."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE all of a sudden heard their names in bed like someone next to you is calling you?,"Hypnagogic hallucinations, related to sleep paralysis but not as intense.
Basically you're dreaming while either drifting off to sleep but not actually sleeping or when going from sleep to awake.
It can be jarring, but there's nothing to be scared of."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE always feel sad on their birthday?,Yea I'd say a little. Not so much about getting older or anything. I think it has more to do with birthdays while very young seemed like things people were excited to experience with you. As I aged up I think that excitement from others decreased and I was never one to bring a lot of attention like that to myself. Organizing birthday parties for myself stopped because there was no external pressure to do one. So maybe there's just a bit of sadness around others not wanting to celebrate. I don't begrudge anyone about it though. Family and friends; we're all busy so I don't mind.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel a wave of anxiety rush over them when they hear the doorbell?,[removed]
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE constantly count ? I count stairs, steps, etc",Are you a sesame street character with a cape?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE struggle to play video games now?,"My issue is my ADHD; I'll play a game, until my ADHD kicks in. Then I'll either shut down the game and turn on some TV (via laptop) or play another game. Though, I'm waiting for that one special game where you're totally immersed into it. Think Sword Art Online."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE occasionally stutter because your brain is going 200 mph but your mouth has to keep it to the speed limit?,I don’t but my husband has ADHD and complains about dealing with this all the time.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get so overwhelmed/scared/anxious about stuff in your life you just want to sleep to stop thinking about it?,"Yes. I was not in your situation, but yeah, I was in a mental state where all I wanted was just sleep. And I would sleep whenever I had the opportunity just to escape the reality. I just finished my bachelor thesis and I didn’t sleep that much but now that is over and recently losing a good friend (which turned out toxic) has left me pretty much alone and after work I just want to sleep. 
I am sorry that you don’t have any help. Hope you stay strong and be hopeful the things will eventually fall into place. At least that is the thought that keeps me at peace sometimes. 
Sending you hugs!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it odd that 80% of American men are subject to genital mutilation at birth?,"Imagine nobody did this, nobody had ever heard of it, and I pitched the idea to you now. That's how you should feel about it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel proud of their relationship after seeing what others deal w/?,"Every day.  It's often that my wife will look at me or I'll look at her and just say ""I love you so much"" after seeing or hearing what others couples we know put themselves through.  Whether it's dumb shit that could have been avoided by simple communication, constant arguing, or just plain drama...  I'm so happy my wife and I are not like that in our relationship.  She's my best friend and I'm hers.  We value and appreciate each other's opinion.  We communicate about everything.  We don't always agree and that's fine.  We always find a common ground that we're both satisfied with.  We laugh together, we cry together, we love together.  She's quite literally my other half because with her I feel whole."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE genuinely want the ability to ""vote out"" reddit mods?","What would prevent people from building coalitions of people and taking over subs? Don’t like what some contentious subs are saying; next thing you know it is brigaded and taken over. 

Reddit will be an even bigger echo chamber than it already is."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have no erogenous sensation in their nipples or testicles?,"My husband is like this, which is unfortunate for me, but it makes it fun to try and find other spots"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE thinks it's kind of Medieval to make fun of mentally ill people and drug addicts on social media?,"I've had a mental breakdown. I want everyone reading this to know I snapped at the self checkout. I couldn't handle it. And the Very Kind manager at the time helped me. Bitched about the check out machines. And honestly held off the rest of the breakdown for a few more hours. He saved me so much grief that day just by being kind. 

Be like him. Not the ass-wipe with the camera."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE who wears glasses take them off and go into “blur mode” when they want to be anti-social?,"As a lifelong glasses wearer, I get it; I often just need a break from the world and a change of focus"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE who’s a parent of teens let their friends come over late at night?,"Does your 17 year old not go to school?

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have quasi-dreams right before they drift off to sleep?,"Sort of, but mine aren't usually visual.

Very often we I'm drifting off, my inner dialogue turns out a thought that's pretty random, in a free-associative dreamlike sort of way. Then the fraction of my mind that's still conscious considers what it just said and snaps alert. I usually fall asleep a few minutes after, so it's a weirdly reliable cue for me."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE refuse to even look at ads between the time they pop up and the option to close them appears?,"That's me. I don't see them often since I have all the blockers and ad-free apps, but if they do appear, I avoid looking at them. They are only an annoyance."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not care about Christmas this year?,I miss the magic i felt when I was a kid
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want Christmas to be over already?,"Nah. I’ve hated Christmas with a passion for 20 years being in the service industry. I quit two years ago and moved away from my shitty town, finally feel “cleansed” enough to actually enjoy Christmas this year. I keep it simple so no stress here."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE listen to their their “liked songs” playlist and transition smoothly from rap to bluegrass to heavy metal and to everything else between Robert Johnson and and EDM, instead of just picking a genre/mood for the vibe and staying with it?","90% of the time I just shuffle liked songs, and yes it's all over the place."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE skip through like every song on their playlist some days,Musical equivalent of those days where you stare into the fridge full of stuff and feel like there's nothing to eat.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel that nobody actually listens to people when they talk?,"Conversationally, most people are focused on what they’re going to say next more than they are genuinely focused on what the other person is saying. So in a way, no one is really listening with 100% focus unless they’ve personally made the habit of actively listening."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have trauma from iPhone ringers?,"Especially if it's a text/ringtone for your worst ever ex. Traumatic, hearing that."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think that most of reddit is just a bunch of sad, angry people with a mob mentality?","To hell with you! Come on everyone, let’s get OP!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTwcCVajAc"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE, when shopping, take the item just behind the front one, in case someone breathed or sneezed on it?","Yes but not because I think people sneezed all over it, a sneeze will go everywhere anyways. I do it because I expect the ones in the front to have been handled the most and thus be the most likely to be damaged or worn down."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE want to be around others but doesn't want to be around others?,"In my perfect world I could be around humans, observe humans, but only interact with them on some occasions.   Like playing an mmorpg game exclusively solo."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get stressed out Saturday night about getting stressed out Sunday about having to go to work/school on Monday?,Does anybody get stressed everyday because. Well. Just because?
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just know they're not a likable person?,Im assuming ppl just tolerate me. So not rlly but sorta

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE use paper towels to sap out the excessive amounts of oil in their food?,"No, I love oil!"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel happiness when seeing people, who were against subsidized healthcare and unemployment benefits, suddenly needing them?","It doesn't change anything in their minds. For every person against these things, *their* circumstance is unique, is justified. ""Not like all these other lazy slobs. I *actually* need them."" People like that have this strong belief that their own situation and experiences are special and not exactly the same kind of experiences 90% of other people standing next them face."
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else have a certain food or dish that they absolutely cannot stand, even though everyone else seems to love it?",Pad thai. I really sincerely wish I liked it. I’ve tried it so many times. And I will continue to try it everytime it’s offered but I never like it. Still convinced someone will prove me wrong one day tho.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think their parents didn't do a good job raising them to deal with how hard or cruel life can be and as a result you just crumble in the face of adversity?,"I had the opposite problem. My whole childhood was filled with adversity and a lack of parental involvement. My mom had schizophrenia and committed suicide when I was 16. Even though she died when I was a teen, she was in and out of hospitals all my childhood. My dad wasn’t there. I bounced around various family members. I was serious about doing well in school and started a great career for myself. My siblings that grew up with my dad, are all sheltered and unprepared for adulthood like you. He’s also uber religious so they constantly LIVE at church. Im so glad my life worked out the way it did. In the long run, I do feel it made me stronger, independent and adaptable."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get nervous about appointments that aren’t even scary or intimidating but they stop you from planning past that appointment? Like I can’t even plan what’s for dinner tomorrow because I have an appointment this evening at a driving school. I can’t even describe how it makes me feel.,"Yep. I've been told it's a trait of neurodivergency, but I do the same thing. If I have an appointment one day I plan nothing else because I need to spend all my time before the appointment relaxing and preparing and all my time afterward decompressing my anxious brain."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feels like peeing after just peeing?,"Urinary retention can be an indication of an underlying condition, such as an enlarged prostate or urethral stricture.  If you develop any accompanying symptoms such as pain/burning on urination, difficulty starting and maintaining a stream, and any pelvic pain, I would suggest you investigate this issue with a healthcare professional. 

Stay healthy friends!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find their sleep quality more depends on when they sleep instead of how many hours they sleep?,I’ve found the quality of sleep I get is 100% determined by whether my 80lb dog decides to sleep next to me or my wife
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE try to not listen to a song they like often so it doesn't get old,I listen to it on repeat until I'm tired of it
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not really go out to eat anymore?,"Dude I'm poor(cant afford fast food or even get to it), I'm stuck in a rural town. I work at a Pizza place in said town and people order $40-$74 ,3-5 nights out of the week

How can they afford this?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE always want it to rain?,"I'm not opposed to rain personally and quite enjoy it. But it would get really depressing real quick, because it turns out we need sunlight for a good chunk of our vitamin D needs. Which without that we run into a whole slew of issues. But I wouldn't mind living in a place that rained pretty consistently with sunlight making a frequent appearance as well."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE know how to drive a standard?,"I’ve only driven standard transmissions, except for a rental car now and then. They are actually a pretty good deterrent for theft in North America."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE loves the smell of Petrol!?,"My dad ran an antique auto dealership, and recently passed. Every time I fill up my tank, I think of all the fun rides we took together on those old cars. I’ve always liked the smell, but now it has an added layer of melancholy nostalgia."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else get sad about not being close to your siblings anymore as adults?,Just recently I've found that playing video games with my siblings every other weekend is a great conduit for bonding when we otherwise wouldn't have the time to do so. We'll all hop on Discord and play some sort of slow-ish paced multiplayer game and catch up with each other through that. Maybe see if your siblings would be interested in joining you in some sort of low cost of entry online activity that can facilitate some sort of bonding
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE eat ingredients?,My college roommate did this with both ramen and oatmeal packets.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE thank vaping for quitting their smoking habit ... 10 year smoker finally kicked the habit thanks to vaping,"Yes, but now I need to quit vaping."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE respond to messages extremely late so you don’t have to have a conversation?,"Must be nice to be so popular. Lol. But honestly, if I haven’t responded in like 20 minutes don’t expect one. I’ll leave with “read” and unless it’s something that needs a response, I’m leaving it at that."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE piss in the shower because you cant be bothered to get out?,"What's more sanitary? Pissing in an open bowl of dirty water, with the potential for splash-back? Or pissing in an open drain and washing my entire body with soap afterwards?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE like the smell of gasoline,"Yeah, I do. I also really love the smell of coffee when it’s brewing I don’t actually drink coffee."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel as though they're not meant to survive?,You are going to survive for much longer than you think. So you best start preparing for a long and fruitful life.
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else get scared of unexpected small talk?,"I have social anxiety so I totally feel you on this. I have no issue having a convo that is immediately related to my job or something I have a big interest in, but if you go off track and ask me how my day is going or what I’m doing later, I start stuttering and blushing lmao. It’s like “wait hold up, I haven’t downloaded this part of the dialogue program just yet” lmao. I’ll probably say something incoherent or try to keep it very close-ended.

I avoid any convo that rails off what I already have scripted/programmed in my head lol."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE NOT have flaming diarrhea from eating taco bell?,"People get wasted,  eat Taco Bell, then bitch about shitting their brains out as if the 7 Jager shots and 6 Natty Lights had nothing to do with it.

DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE start singing a random song, then just to be silly, keep repeating the same line/lyric across the rest of the other parts of the song?","Yes, but in ""Meows""."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not know what to say most of the time?,"I wouldn’t say all the time, but there are times for sure. I despise small talk, so I try to ask questions and get others taking about themselves and their interest. Or just don’t talk if you don’t want, no big deal. One of my best friends barely talks and is the coolest."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE intentionally put an item out of place to remind yourself to do something later?,"Yes! It’s called a visual cue. It doesn’t even need to have anything to do with what you need to remember. Just seeing something purposefully made unusual or put out of place (e.g., a string tied around your finger) can trigger your memory. It helps you (consciously or unconsciously) think, ‘I see something out of the ordinary…that I intentionally made that way…to remind me to_____.’ The brain is amazing!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE eat the entire box of Kraft mac n cheese?,It's supposed to serve 4 people. Says so right on the box. ( Never in my lifetime has it served 4)

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think companies forcing employees to say specific things is creepy as shit?,Yeah I hate going places where employees are forced to say shit like this.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have dreams so detailed and intricate that you can’t even believe how you even thought of that information?,"Have you gone through a near death experience? I’ve read that people who’ve almost died or were brought back to life have way more intense vivid dreams the rest of their life. I went through an experience like that and my dreams were never the same. I was brought back to life 7 years ago and for the last 7 years my dreams are like what your describing. Some bad, some unbelievably awesome."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Opens a window/cools down their sleeping room as much as possible to enjoy sleeping in really cold room with many blankets?,My wife does.   Year round she has the fan on and the window open just so we can use the giant comforters.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE cry easily during movies/series?,Yes. What's even worse is that I don't usually cry aside from while watching movies/series
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get disappointed when you sit down to poop but all you end up doing is peeing and farting?,"""here I sit, broken hearted,
Tried to poop, but only farted"""
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE watch little kids' shows at an older age?,I still watch SpongeBob because it’s hilarious
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wish it was still the norm to dress better in public?,Yes. I think people tend to act dignified when they look dignified. Sometimes I wish I could wear a casual style suit everywhere without looking weird.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE turn upside down in bed when you can't sleep? Like your head at the foot of the bed.,"If it gets to that point for me, I’m pretty much fucked."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE regret how they lost their virginity?,"I lost it to a random person I didn’t know and never spoke to again. Honestly I’m just grateful I wasn’t even more stupid. I wish I’d lost it to someone who meant something, anything to me."

DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else NOT like porn?,"Honestly fictional smut is porn, just in a different medium."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE doesn’t have any ambitions in life and is scared of responsibility?,"I feel similarly although I *want* to find something to strive for, be responsible for and passionate about. And I keep trying, but I just don’t feel like I belong in this world."
DoesAnybodyElse,does anybody else make tea and then,Every single time LOL
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get obscenely specific and cryptic memories out of no where like deja vu. Like a flashback to a memory of an extremely unimportant moment at 2:34pm on Friday 2013 and I was talking to my friend about ____????,"This happens to me all the time. Sometimes I'll randomly get a flashback to a dream I had years ago. It's very strange. I also get a lot of flashbacks to random childhood memories. 

When it happens I try to think about what triggered the memory, but most of the time I can't see a connection. It's random. I think the dream flashbacks are the most interesting."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE when they were younger, would ‘hear’ voices when the bathtub faucet was running?","It's called 'Audio Pareidolia'. Your brain is trying to decode speech all the time. If you have a quiet environment with white noise, it's not unusual to hear words. It's the same thing that leads to people hearing things in 'backwards music'."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE they're becoming dumber the older they get?,It's more like I'm more aware of my stupidity as I get older.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE enjoy dipping their French Fries in ice cream?,Wendy's Frosties most notably.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have days where they are just on the verge of tears for no reason?,"Yep had one of them today, it's best to just acknowledge it and try again tomorrow. If you push yourself to hard to try and fix yourself then it just becomes worse. You can't fix yourself, only heal."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE completely psychoanalyse themselves and then do nothing to improve?,Every single fucking day
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE be honest with the physician when they ask what drugs you take and such?,"Yes. You are supposed to tell them.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE just idle with t-rex arms?,"Yes, I call it Mr Burns-ing"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get unreasonably nervous when they hear car doors shut outside their house?,"Yep

I have a Motion alarm , in fact I have four of them , positioned around my lot , anyone walking onto my 3/4 acre lot will usually trigger one of them , they all have different beeps so I know which one it is .

We did it initially so the Amazon or fed ex delivery’s wouldn’t surprise us .

And it didn’t take long at all for the dog to figure out that when the beeper went off someone was gonna be in the driveway soon, so he was always waiting at the door to bark at them ."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get a temporary sharp pain in the joint(s) in your jaw when eating sour candy?,It is your salivary glands opening up.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel sad after spending a lot of money?,"it doesn’t hurt to treat yourself every once in a while. imo if you can afford it and know you’re going to use it, then buy it. fuck it, it’s your money. you earned it and can probably earn it back if you continue doing what you did to acquire it in the first place."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not like feeling their own heart beat while lying in bed?,"Yep I hate it. I also hate when I wear earbuds and can feel/hear my heartbeat as well. My least favorite is when I eat food and feel my aorta pumping blood to my abdomen, my stomach even visibly pulsates when I've eaten and doctors say there is no aneurism or anything causing it. Just in general hearing or feeling heartbeat/blood flow is uncomfortable and can make me kinda anxious."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the world / life smelled different 10-15 years ago?,"Sometimes I catch a whiff on the air of what smells like the past... like sunshine in winter, that kinda thing."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever just start crying because of the state of the world?,"It makes you the best person. Sorry it hurts so much. The world needs more people like you.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel happier/livelier at night?,It’s the only time you belong to yourself
DoesAnybodyElse,Dae find the idea of burial really horrible?,"I’m the opposite. I want a natural burial, I like the idea of just decomposing and all the beasties eating me and my constituent parts going back into the ground that I’ve taken so much from over my life. Symbolic to me."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE write stuff/thoughts down randomly in their notes app or on paper?,"Homework I can understand but why crush? That’s just a random romantic thought, there’s no task there to follow on."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE wish everyone could walk around naked or without underwear sometimes? I'm tired of having to stand up and adjust my dicknballs, it's uncomfortable and I'm tired of it","You can walk around without underwear? Many, many people do it daily. I don't have dicknballs experience, I could imagine wearing jeans and no underwear might be even more uncomfortable but can't hurt too much to try 🤷‍♀️ 
I'm an avid commando fan when I'm wearing clothing that can accommodate it."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE close Reddit, go to do something else, then open Reddit again like five seconds later?",On da regular dawg

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE brush their teeth while showering,Almost exclusively in the shower... the real question is. What's the issue with doing so?
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like you need to ""settle in"" upon coming back from a vacation?",That's why Mom always insisted that the house be immaculately clean before we went on a trip. It felt better getting back to a clean house.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get overwhelmingly bothered by any kind of christmas music?,I love it in small doses but there’s no reason it needs to play for more than two weeks
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think the workplace is so awkward/cringey?,"I avoid work events like you are describing, so I cant speak to those situations. But in general I find the workplace super cringey. I blame mostly the fact that everyone tries to act professional, for example, when someone makes a classic workplace joke that isn't funny at all to anyone (if someone is talking to whoever is in charge of payroll they say the classic pay me more and stuff like that every single time, they should bring wine to bday celebrations to have with cake etc.) and everyone does an ingenuine laugh. No one finds these comments funny, even the person saying it, but it is kind of part of the workplace. It's draining"
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else use half the salt packet for ramen to pretend they’re being healthy about it?,"Yeah, I typically use half the packet. It still tastes good enough."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Prefer to be alone than be put in social situations since covid hit?,"Yes!  I’ve always been going 100 mph. Now I refuse to put on hard pants and leave the house. I also don’t let anyone visit cause I don’t want anyone in my space and interfering in my peace. Covid, while awful, helped me stop living by other people’s standards of normal."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE shave their face in a strategic pattern to avoid accidentally giving yourself a hitler moustache if the razor breaks or runs out of power at the wrong time?,"No. I'm not concerned about that. In fact, I'm sure every guy has at least once left the Hitler mustache for last so he could see how it looks on him."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE constantly feel angry that your family members have good genes and you don't,"My husband who is the youngest of 3 ended up getting the “fucked up foot” gene apparently. He has bunions and he’s super self conscious about it. 

Me: I got gastrointestinal issues and bad hair thinning (genetic alopecia). 

My best gene is that I never grew body hair on my legs and arms. Idk what shaving my legs is like, never had to do it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE prefer to hang out with people who talk way more than them?,Well if it breaks the ice with new people it avoids those awkward silences and I can say something only when I really want to. So sometimes yes.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like vacations are the least relaxing event?,"vacations are the worst, always in a hurry to cram as much into your limited time there, and not the mention the stress of traveling to your location and back"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have no friends,"real friends, no. opportunistic friends? hundreds"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like a lot of the ""funny animal videos"" posted on the internet are cruel?","I hate those compilations on youtube. 99% are the animals actually getting hurt. Like one that was in every ""funny"" compilation for a while was a cat getting its claws stuck on a cord hanging from the ceiling fan and they turned it on and the cat slammed into the wall really hard. Or animals jumping out of glass windows. Falling from balconies. Pets killing wildlife like native birds, frogs, etc. I wont watch those anymore because apparently most humans are sociopaths."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have really intense emotional dreams you cry in it and wake up with actual tears,"I used to have extremely emotional dreams like these, I still have them but not as frequently. I believe it’s your subconscious mind trying to work through emotions that you may struggle with or not quite deal with in your conscious thoughts. Journaling about your dreams, when you do remember them, is a very helpful tool that can help you break down your feelings."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Not dream at all?,"you do dream you just don’t remember them. if you didn’t dream then you aren’t going through all the stages of sleep, if you’re worried do a sleep study"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get sick of the sex questions on Reddit? There is more to life than sex, I wonder if it’s young people posting these",I keep NSFW tab off. And my Reddit is squeaky clean. You can try that.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have one (1) random thin almost invisible hair that grows at random places?,"One? No, not just one. 

Once upon a time it might have been one single hair, but as you get older..."
DoesAnybodyElse,Dae feel like they've been traumatized by a roommate situation?,I just hate living with randoms. People are fucked and i want to live alone.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think they should teach kids how to improve emotional intelligence in schools?,"yes. my sons school has SEL, social emotional learning, where they teach the kids to put themselves in other kids shoes. it's pretty neat"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not enjoy the company of anyone for more than half a day or so?,"I'm good with a few hours of dinner and/or drinks and I'll see ya next week or in a month for the same. 

Only time it's half a day or day is if there's an event or a series of activities we're doing together."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sniff their milk after opening the jug?,"As a Canadian, I sniff my bag."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE fear the day their parents will die?,"Yea, I think it’s all something we wrestle with around this age. I’m similar to you and now when I capture a good photo of them, I save it in a special album for “that day”. 

I wrote my Dad a long thank you letter last year (he’s 70+ but in good health) and he told me he did the same thing for his father when he was that age. 

Just use the fear as motivation to spend as much quality time with them as you can. Take lots of videos and photos."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel awkward when they are barefoot in front of others,Yes haha. Like out of nowhere you feel naked and ashamed for no reason. But i only have it with people i don't or barely know
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE watch shows from your childhood, as an adult, only to realize how many adult references you never noticed as a kid?",Yes! It’s great haha
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Spend hours on google maps/earth exploring the world?,"Absolutely. 

Maps are love, maps are life."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think that raw cookie dough tastes much better than actual cookies?,Yes!!! And that “safe edible cookie dough” can take a hike!
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel offended when ppl with children say “I go to work for a break” or “working is easy compared to staying at home”,"I'd say, don't take it as an insult, take it as a warning. 😂 Parenting sucks. For good parents, it's the hardest job they'll ever love."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel guilty about spending money on unnecessary treats, e.g. chocolate, and expensive foods?",publix’s international candy items aisle is the devil.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wonder if this influencer era will abruptly end and leave them jobless/not qualified?,I wonder that about youtubers and streamers pretty often. They spend years building their brand but the algorithm at any moment could decide to fuck them over and they will lose everything.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE go to random city's on google earth and explore it in depth for hours?,"Yes, all over the world. You forget about time"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like you are more emotional when you're alone but cannot show emotions or lose all your feelings when around someone?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have random scattered memories somewhere in their brain but have no idea whether it's from real life, a show, a book, a movie, a dream, a fake scenario or just something that doesn't even exist?",I struggle with the fact that memories are altered every time you access them

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get satisfaction while vacuuming and you suck up something large and it makes that noise going through the vacuum?,Ouuu the *crinkle*
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have no friends? I don't have friends. Only coworkers that I hang out with, am I that weird?","I was like you. 
There was a turning point...I found out it wasnt I dont feel the need for them. It is because I am afraid to get hurt from whatever they do to me.... I was protecting myself.

I am not sayin we are the same but as long as you are happy and not questioning yourself. Then you are good. You are not weird"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE rehearse conversations before making a phone call?,"Oh for sure, I even write down important points that I want to bring up, its all good."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like you’re just going through the motions, awaiting a modern apocalypse, and thus unable to truly and fully devote oneself to any particular hobby goal or endeavor?","Yep. I’m finding it harder and harder to truly relax. Disaster, political and cultural instability, poor economic outlooks, deteriorating quality of life, all feel like near-constants now.

However, I don’t think this is a case of awaiting anything. We’re already living in the apocalypse. We just haven’t fully realized it yet, because I think we’re hard coded to understand catastrophes as sudden events that have cleanly defined boundaries between not-happening, happening, and happened.

Aside from some specific examples (ie, the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs), a lot of extinction events in our fossil record were a slow but steady change over the course of years or even centuries."
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE think about how some names seem normal for a baby, but weird for an elderly person, and vice versa?","Names, like fashion, can be seen as a trend. Back in the day maybe names like Martha or Gertrude were the style for younger people. Obviously, as those people aged, so did the association of their names. Think about it, in a few decades there will be nursing homes full of Jessica's and Brian's. Then the generations after that will find those to be ""old people"" names and feel just like you do now"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE not give a single fuck about washing labels in clothes?,"My clothes know it's survival of the fittest. 

It's also the reason i shop at goodwill. Evidence that they can take abuse."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else feel like they’re pretending all the time?,Yes. Being an adult and polite all the time is really exhausting.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE feel like “Life” is literally a real game, and you are losing.","With the world the way it is, I think we're all losing."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE anyone ever be chewing on one side of their mouth and then decide the other side needs some chewing too?,I do. It feels unfair to one side so I switch to the other
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE check your elderly pet(s) to make sure they're still alive?,It's hard getting to this stage with them. Although it's easy to appreciate the days.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE have a mediocre/shitty signature?,Mine the first letter of my name and a scribble
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE completely break down when someone asks if you're alright when you're feeling down or upset?,Yes!  I can hold it together and I'm fine until someone shows an ounce of empathy.  Then I'm a complete mess!!
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE find old cemetries and gravestones, dna, and ancestry to be really fascinating?","I think a lot of people do.  I work at a cemetery and we're having a historical tour tonight.  In fact, we had one last week and it was so popular we had to schedule another for today because the first one filled up so quickly."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE with an uncommon name feel weird when they hear their name in a movie or TV show?,My name isn't uncommon and I still feel weird hearing it on tv
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE slice a new a block of cheese through the package with a sharp knife rather than opening it first?,"I cut about a half inch from the end, slice up some cheese, then take that little half inch of packaging and cover the “new” cheese end so it doesn’t go bad haha"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE truly despise when people waste food for the sake of ""pranks""?","Yes, it's absolutely disgusting and an unnecessary waste. I hate it so much I just wanna slap some sense into those idiots. And I almost actually mean it."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE get really defensive of your country when someone from somewhere else criticizes it?,"Nah, I'm British. Bashing our country to all and sundry is sort of a national pastime."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE shake their foot while trying to fall asleep in bed?,I cant sleep without rubbing my feet together
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE ever just wanna run away from their responsibilities and travel the world or something?,"Been there, done that, strongly recommend it"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like businesses and business owners are trying to “take back” what little powers the workers were getting?,"This is exactly true. Actually, a few months ago an email was leaked from the CFO of Chase sent to the SEC outlying the best possible ways for the government to tip the scales back in favor of the employers."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE struggle to form opinions on some things because they really can “see both/all sides” and feel they must be wrong all the time?,"A term for this sort of thought process is ""ambivalence"".

You do not necessarily lack the ability to form an opinion, but rather it sounds that you are willing to divulge into multiple areas of a problem without needing to commit to a single conclusion.

This is a quality that thoughtful, intelligent people display. Life is not black and white, and there are often many possibilities and options to consider when confronted with any issue."
DoesAnybodyElse,"Does anybody else randomly see the lights flicker, and you can’t tell if they actually flickered or if you just blinked so lightly that you didn’t even notice?",I thought it was just me.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE rehearse in your head what you're going to say when you know you're about to talk to someone and then try out different ways of saying it before settling on what you're going to say?,I do. It’s called social anxiety.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE think it's weird and gross and scary to hookup with random strangers never to be seen again or build a relationship?,To each their own I suppose
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sometimes feel so moved by a song you just want to cry?,"Are there people who don't? 

All the usual ones, but I can listen to and cry really hard with an opera that's not in my language and have no idea what it's about...but it's really emotional, sometimes classical music too. Normally it's the lyrics, but that doesn't explain the opera."
DoesAnybodyElse,Does anybody else?,"Fuck you, you made me do it! :-)"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE spend most of the time with their Partner in bed?,"That's a basic description of my relationship, yes. haha Just curious, do you guys have friends?"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like the 'multiverse' idea is becoming oversaturated in movies/tv recently,"Yes, and I think EEAAO will have been the inflection point. I really wonder where they will go from here. Maybe come full circle and have very grounded, microcosm style of movies."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find it hard to believe people who claim they have memories from a very early age?,"I was in a crib until I was two years old, and I remember lying on my back in the crib, looking at lots of white, being a little bored because I wasn’t sleepy. 

I wasn’t much of a napper, but my mother was."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel like they aren't cut out for life?,"My god are we the same person. did you also get your cats as a ""can't suicide cats will be homeless"" type deal?"

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE sneeze when puking their eyebrows??,"Why did you swallow them in the first place? That would likely make me puke, idk about sneezing though."
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE gone from being socially popular to a bit of an outcast in adult life?,"Being social is like being fit, it takes constant effort to build up & maintain the muscle. If you stop working out, the muscle will atrophy. 

I believe people go through longer term cycles of socialization. If you’re yearning for more connection, go out and put yourself into the world. Natural laws of attraction will do the rest & you’ll find new friends. 

It’s **never** too late!"
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE get irritated by the expression ""influencer""","I'm more irritated by the existence of *influencers*  period, probably one of the dumbest things that has been born from the internet and social media."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE fixate on a specific food for a chunk of time until they get tired of it?,"What??? I can get Lemon Cheerios??? 

I NEED Lemon Cheerios! ..... Gone shopping! ..... Bye!!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Get tonsil stones?,Nope because I don’t have any tonsils.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE have no idea what they are going to do with their life, in particular around late 20s/early 30s?","I am 30, have a bioscience degree, never got a science job, completely wasted, wanna work with horses now, can't afford a second education. Trying to claw some experience and crash courses but every hurdle is falling apart. And it won't even be more than minimum fucking wage.

I feel like I messed up my only shot at life."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE find grammar nazis extremely pretentious,It is ok to use capital letters though.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE imagine they are the best YouTuber ever and you talk to a fake audience,"I'm constantly ""explaining"" to an fake audience what I'm doing in my head, mostly when working, gaming or cooking."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE wipe their bum several times throughout the day even when you didn't take a dump?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel uncomfortable in their body?,"All day, every day. It feels like everything is off kilter, too heavy, difficult to lug around and can't get any better.

DoesAnybodyElse,DAE thank Oreos are overrated?,[deleted]
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE whisper to themselves and make up stories? Or am I crazy?,I talked to myself and act out random scenarios in my head in the shower.
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel grateful that their heart has been working tirelessly for so long?,"Lol I actually do think this quite a bit! It never really stops until you die, and that makes a small part of me nervous! In the same way that I hate leaving a lightbulb on constantly, or my car running when parked. It seems like it should need a break- at least once in a while!"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Just sit outside the front porch and enjoy the quiet,I wish I had a porch.
DoesAnybodyElse,"DAE cant answer the question “what do you want to do” by gut feeling, because your gut only ever really wants to go home and be alone?","Me kinda.

I dont really want to do anything most of the time. I'd rather just chill on my own or find small projects where I work with my hands.

I've never been able to answer that question other than say, ""Travel."" I love to travel and eat good food."
DoesAnybodyElse,HAE noticed recently an increase in drivers blatantly disregarding red lights?,"Yes, ever since the pandemic. I think it started with fewer people on the road but it hasn't stopped"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE burp when people pat you on the back?,"Im sorry, but this is actually hilarious"
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Socialize a lot better with people 1 on 1 than they do in groups?,"Congratulations, you’re an introvert. 🙂

Read the book “Quiet” by Susan Cain, it’ll give you some insights and help calibrate how you communicate and why."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE notice low paying job titles are getting fancier and fancier?,"This reminds me of George Carlin's routine on soft language. In changing how people describe jobs or situations, the ruling class is ultimately trying to conceal reality: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o25I2fzFGoY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o25I2fzFGoY)."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE buy multiple sets of the same clothing so they can wear the same thing multiple times in a row like a cartoon character?,"No, but I buy multiple pairs of the same shoes or jeans to have on the ready when I’ve worn one out."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE type out the emoji they want instead of attempting to search for it?,"Yes…I do sometimes. You can find some cute emoji or a gif that can coney a cute message…after some written words, of course. I only do this with close, like-minded friends."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE Feel like they are destined to be a nobody?,"You need to do what makes you happy. Make sure it's not that you're just avoiding pain. 

Because what you're describing sounds like depression."
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE constantly have songs playing in their head?,Super common symptom of ADHD as I learned from my wife’s diagnosis
DoesAnybodyElse,DAE feel they can't share good things that happened to them with their friends?,"I know everyone is saying get better friends - and I agree don’t keep toxic people in your life. However, have you reached out to see if they’re okay? Life is hard and very depressing."
