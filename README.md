# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

### Description

In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project will put those skills to the test.

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:
1. Using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you'll collect pairs of __Question and the answer with most votes__ from various subreddits.
2. Next, you will use [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) API to ask the same question to ChatGPT. You will repeat this process for all the questions from Step 1. You need to ignore any responses where ChatGPT refuses to provide a "straightforward" answer. This kind of responses usually have a pattern and they usually start with something like "As a large language model I do not have the ability to blah blah...". If you receive such a response, move on to the next question. Gather at least 5000 such question-answer pairs and corresponding ChatGPT response.
3. Create a dataset with the data collected in previous two steps. Ideally, the dataset should have at least the following columns:

| row_id | Question | Human_written_answer | ChatGPT_generated_answer |
| ------- | ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1 | abcd | efgh | ijkl |

4. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on whether a response came from a human being or ChatGPT. This is a binary classification problem.

## Checkpoints and Advice

If you aren't familiar with [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), go check it out and browse different subreddits. Each subreddit is like a forum on a different topic. [Here's a list of subreddits by topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/listofsubreddits)

- What you choose could partly determine how difficult your data cleaning will be and how challenging the classification task will be for your algorithms. In your presentation and executive summary, **tell us what you used**.
- You should aim to have a function built to pull down data from the API by Monday, September 18.
- The more data you can pull the better for your classifier. **You will want data from at least 3000 unique, non-null comments.**

---

### Requirements

- Gather and prepare your data using the appropriate APIs.
- **Create and compare at least two models**. These can be any classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Random Forest Classifier, etc.
  - **Bonus**: use a Naive Bayes classifier
- You **must** build a robust commit history on GHE for this project, with the first commit no later than next Monday, 9/18/23.
- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.
- An executive summary of your results.
- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.

**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).

---

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Code and executive summary must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.
- You must submit your slide deck.
- Materials must be submitted by **9:00 AM EST on Monday, September 18, 2023**.
- Presentation must be ready by **09:00 AM EST on Monday, September 18, 2023**.

**Scores will be out of 30 points based on the 10 categories in the rubric.** <br>
*3 points per section*<br>

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |

### Why did we choose this project for you?
This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.

Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but sometimes scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).

Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.

Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.
